inmdrd,"Venting about friend problems. Okay, so years ago back in high school the first year or so I made a few friends quite quickly, but I never really spent time with them outside of school at the time, it's like it didn't even cross my mind, and when they offered me the choice I was like ""well, I can just see them at school can't I?"". Just didn't give it much thought. In the meanwhile they probably did otherwise and just went to parties, had sleepovers at each other's homes, etc. Once during class when we got an assignment for two people I actually came up with a really stupid reason to not visit someone's house to work on the assignment together when they asked me if I wanted to come over and this understandably pissed them off (I was super blunt about this). They even told me that they'd told this to their parents and at that point I simply thought ""okay, never going to *that* place then"". And indeed, I never went to their place. The years after that went mostly the same in this regard, I also met a few new friends along the way, and at most I went to one of my friend's place like 3-4 times or so. Late into high school we also got offered the options to go for a trip to the Czech Republic, after that a sailing camp, etc. But I also declined all those. At some point, high school was over and we all went our own separate ways (I studied media design for a few years which I graduated from early 2019). A little while after that they still invited me to go camping with them but I refused that as well. Stuff stayed pretty inactive after that, but eventually one of them sent me a message asking me if I wanted to leave from our (now their) WhatsApp group which I was always in, since they pretty much exclusively used it to plan vacations and stuff now, and I never replied anyway (no bad blood or anything, they even said they hoped we'd meet again). Since then I've never really seen them again nor spoke with them online, and ever since I graduated in early 2019 from my most recent study I've been home, jobless and friendless, and it's really starting to sink in that I fucked up back then. However, I just can't bring myself to really reach out to them again. I feel like it's been too long (last time I was in the WhatsApp group they even invited a new friend which I haven't met before, they probably met them after high school), I just think it's odd to pick up communication again like this out of nowhere or visit them (I imagine their parents must also be like ""who's that? A friend? And they never bothered to visit before?""). A part of me really wants to just go and try to reconnect, but another is like ""well, they must have changed throughout the years by now (our interests never really aligned in the first place but the last time we separated even more in that regard), it seems they have new friends now too which I don't feel comfortable meeting anyhow, etc, anyhow I should just find new friends and make sure it goes right this time"". However, finding new friends is also a pain since I don't have the advantage of school right now (seriously, school made this really easy but without school it seems so impossible). My social anxiety has also increased from a lack of social interaction for a while now, and being indoors almost 24/7 (though I've had social anxiety for most of my life). Sometimes I actually have dreams where I just say ""fuck it, I'm going to visit them"" and it ends up really nicely, but then I wake up and I'm like ""crap"". Honestly idk, what do you think?"
rav4bw,"I can’t live with the mind I was given.. Every night I grip that trigger a little tighter, with my sweaty, grey hands. I’m only 21. I have my whole life ahead of me which scares the hell out of me. I suffer from an extreme case of social anxiety and depression, to the point where it has changed me into a heartless monster with no soul. A heart of stone, no empathy, no smiling, no crying. I’m just a shell. It has ate away at everything I once was as a happy little boy. Every time I walk outside I feel like I have 500 sniper rifles pointed at me. When I’m with people, they all seem like they have really figured out life, and genuinely enjoy living. And that scares the hell out of me. It shows me how much different I really am from them, and you can imagine how alone I must feel, in a deep, black hole. I see these people I hangout with die laughing of a simple meme, and i struggle to even smile. There is just so much stress caught up in my head, and anger towards the world, towards people. Even with being on a benzodiazepine, and therapy, I still feel the same way. I feel like a ticking time bomb waiting for someone to try to jab at me, then explode. I can’t keep living like this. Staying in my dark room all day Listening to depressing music like Linkin Park, trying to find someone who understands my pain, and the monster inside me. Every time I hear people talking I always assume it’s about me, bad things about me, and I can’t seem to convince myself I’m wrong. I am living in hell with so many mental problems. I’ve been keeping all of this bottled up inside for so many years. Everyday I visualize myself getting hit by a truck, or never waking up after overdosing. It’s so comforting and soothing. The thought of death. I don’t feel like I have a purpose on this earth. I just feel like everyone my age is so far ahead of me and has their life planned out, while I’m just trying to get through hour by hour. Every night I stare at the gun, gradually gripping it tighter day by day, until I decide I have had enough of this cold, cold world."
e03jwjy,"The best guy at this summer job I quit was an insane talent at the core task. Most others were at least 'sort of good at it' nnGive yourself credit for trying to make it work, don't judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree and all. What this job demands just doesn't include the things you have a personal affinity for, that's just a mismatch issue. I'm not a loser for sucking at asking people for their credit card details in the middle of their beach holiday, but I did learn I was better than I thought at animatedly telling total strangers about the local wildlife. If anything you can try to take away that in a pinch you can manage these things, you're more versatile and flexible than you think. Just not infinitely flexible.nnHope it gets better, and if not, welp, it was an experiment!"
khd8q1,"I think ive had SAD all my life and idk how to move past it. For context im a sophomore in college and when i was in preschool my teachers told my mom i never spoke like at all my mom thought i had selected mutism and my teachers just said i was stubborn and shy and when my mom took me to the therapist but after the second visit i literally fought for my life to stay in the car, so my mom fearing i would get traumatized let it go hoping i would fix myself (since she thought the root of it was that i only knew how to speak Spanish and i was embarrassed to try to speak english in front of my peers) and apparently i did get over it after i made a friend i was just classified as “shy” now. I honestly don’t remember anything up until 5th grade when i moved schools and i spent everyday hoping the library was open because it was my safe space where i felt like i wasnt being judged for not being able to make any friends. Talking to people and being able to connect felt so hard, just living began to feel hard. Half way into the year we moved across the state because my mom was sick of my dad and this time i told myself i would make friends no matter what, and i did, i never connected but i made “friends” until 8th grade i was fine but this year in particular hurt the most i felt like everyone knew how much of a loser i felt like. All of my friends were online so when i went to school i had no one and i didnt know how to initiate conversation with someone or become friends. No matter how hard i tried to talk to people and connect with them it never happened. My life felt so meaningless. High school was a bit better with its occasional bumps but college broke me entirely. This year especially is when i learned that everything i experienced wasn’t normal. Its not normal being afraid of walking on the sidewalk alone. Being afraid of people thinking that your a loser for literally going out for a walk/ jog isn’t normal. Being afraid of ordering food or paying at a cashier because you might embarrass yourself isnt normal. Literally panicking at thanksgiving and crying to yourself because your not sitting next to a family member youre not comfortable with is not normal. Getting angry at the people you love because you cant do these simple tasks you know they could easily do isnt normal. Theres so many things i see now that i do that have just become the way i live and learned to accept because i thought everyone had to just push through and do it no matter how much distress it caused them. I just thought everyone was way better at coping than i was until i finally broke and couldnt even try to cope anymore and tried to figure out what was wrong with me so i could start to look for the help i needed to make sure i didnt lose anymore relationships/ life experiences because of this. This year i have to seriously consider dropping out because i could no longer handle the stress that came with it, a lot if things other than SAD had to do with this but the fact that i couldnt join my classes because of the thought of embarrassing myself in front of everyone in my online classes was too overwhelming and i got too behind for me to even keep trying. I thought that everyone was going to know how many classes i already missed and tell me how irresponsible i am and that i need to be trying harder and i dont belong in that university. I know not a single student in any of my classes cares or even knows who i am but i had so many thought keeping me from the classes i wanted to pass so badly. And it didnt help that in my almost two years being there i made a total of 1 friend that i dont even talk to anymore the whole experience was just the most depressing thing of my life. I mean till this day i still havent been diagnosed because i dont even know how to approach that ive never been to a physician or whatever and im too afraid and scared idk i just hate always feeling like a child even though im 19 years old. Idk how relatable this is but i just needed to vent this out i just feel like my life is constantly spiraling and stagnant at the same time if that makes sense and im so tired of it all i just wish i could think and act like someone who isnt anxious about every little thing and can just act and not think about it or regret it and just keep moving forward without a care in the world. I just feel like im drowning constantly because i never make the right choices and idk how i can correct the wrong ones. Dhchfudbdj"
q9uxky, Part of me wants to live in a cottage somewhere in the mountains and rear animals. And have wifi lol 
g26vxba, Thanks for the advice. I think the first step has to be learning to accept myself. I’ll also try to go outside and do something tomorrow. I appreciate the help. 
8zp2kq," it's july and i want to apply for a summer job. i only have till august 27th and i do have an interview tomorrow, but theres a chance i wont get the job. i want to apply to jobs but im scared to piss off people or be humiliated cuz its so late.. well im gonna bike out to stores and see what happens. "
erhwh5q,"I once sat next to my ex gf for 3 hrs on a bus ride. We were leaving from our last year at camp and i knew I'd most likely never see her again. I couldn't think of a single thing for an hr. Then said(in the middle of summer, when it was never cold at all), ""weather's nice today, huh?"" followed by 2 more hrs of silence."
f8041bc,I’m the same way 21 just moved here from Germany and I’ve got kinda stuck in this hole of fear from social anxiety almost paralyzed practically don’t ever leave my room. I am very wary and scared of taking medication just from bad experiences but I started taking sertraline because I can’t stand feeling like this anymore I need to start functioning if I want to make something for myself. My goal is to use the medication so I can start doing things again that make me feel confident and also go to the gym because my anxiety is so bad I have nervous tics where I will jerk my head back or leg and it got better when I started working out but I just got out of routine. I think it is important to try and challenge yourself with baby steps maybe just going outside to walk a dog. Social interaction too make small talk with even a cashier how are you doing ect building confidence because you’ll get in this negative mind set where you’ll just fear and think the worse. Benzodiazepines can work too but I don’t recommend because you’ll not have a stable day-to-day experience as the medication has issues of its own. It’s important to know my medication isn’t a 100% fix either eventually it will stop working you can increase dose but will have more severe withdrawals the higher you go when you taper off. I recommend just trying to get into a recovery state and slowly pick yourself up and make sure you take baby steps slowly build confidence of you go to fast you could fall right back into the hole. In public I try to be with family to just get use to it before I’m confident to be out by myself again. When I find myself getting on edge I just give myself a mental talk that it’s all in my head and I just need to breath making my own confidence to comfort me.
4y3j2o,"When is it okay to give up?. I'm 22, in college, and have god-awful social anxiety. School starts again in just over ten days and I'm on the verge of a panic attack every single time I remember that. All it means is more chances to screw up around other people, embarrass myself, and generally look like an idiot. You'd think I'd be used to that by now, having done the exact same thing since middle school, but nope. It sucks now just as much as it did then. Talking to people is an ordeal. My heart rate skyrockets, I start sweating, stumble over my words, generally just make a mess of things. And god help me if it's a girl I'm talking to. All bets are off then. The last time I voluntarily tried talking to a girl my age I had to practically run away before I passed out due to a panic attack. So I guess what I'm asking is, when can I just admit that this whole ""socializing"" thing isn't for me and call it quits? And no, don't worry, I'm not talking about killing myself. What I mean is...when would it be acceptable to just stop trying? There's going to have to be a time when I accept the reality of being like this forever, and having to move on. Maybe I can just go build a cabin up in the woods or something and be away from all of this. That sounds like it would be the better option right now."
d0p1sta," I often picture a cabin in the woods, off the grid and self sufficient like one of those eccentric building projects on TV. I often fantasise over different plans for such thing, seems far fetched but its beats planning your suicide. "
fecynrp," I mean it’s a fact that our modern day lives are completely unnatural, to think that there’d be a few hiccups is reasonable I think. I’ve been camping a few times with a more natural setting- families huddled up and enjoying themselves and those are the times my social anxiety has been relatively nonexistent. "
dff9mzc,"I took an hour walk last night. It felt nice outside. Didn't really meet anyone though. Most people i did see were on the phone or with someone else talking. I need friends to hang out with even just playing games with them counts, and especially a nice, good looking girlfriend who'd also love my cool nerdy personality. I'm a 20 year old average looking, short guy in a very large university (2nd largest in the US i think) but still really have no one to talk to. Nobody really talks to me either. I'm very shy and talk only when i need to, most likely its about school stuff. I like a girl but dont know what to do im scared. Im in a club for game design, i enjoy doing that but even there i have no friends or talk while everyone else is making conversation. I just work on my game alone, got compliments though about my pixel art style. I was skeptical about craigslist when i first started but it's fine, I feel like my social skills improve since i'm texting the people over the phone then meeting them in person but I still cant make friends idk why. Though most people who buy things are much older than me in their 30's, most girls i meet are usually married with kids. I usually meet at a nearby gas station. I NEVER let anyone in my apartment. I'm told i'm friendly and helpful and get 5 star reviews on offer up, some people buy from me again. I had people argue with me and curse at me though over text in which i'd argue back  and block them, usually its when they get angry about the price (i have a good reason for them), the fact i dont meet at my house (why so they could rob me in the future?), or the fact i cant drive (due to my nystagmus with my eyes i was born with)"
dk9b93o,"What a dick. Screw him OP, even if you did do something that's not right he shouldn't have been a dick, and who cares if you are doing something wrong. It's what you want to do and you're using your own money and planting in your own garden, it doesn't concern anyone else. "
ernpwo3,"yes.na year ago i was in France in Normandy beach.nan american tourist asked if i could take a picture.ni said ""sure""nthen i said ""like this?"" (meaning portrait or landscape mode?)nhe said:ni still think why did i ask ""like this?"" when he had no idea what i meant?"
8qb06f," Another escape. So I gathered some courage to go to the gym. Usually I go during mid day, because then there's very few people at the gym mostly. This time I went on the Sunday morning. Outside I already saw all the cars and biked and knew it was going to be busy. My anxiety started rising. I made it in, took a peek inside the gym and saw a shit load of random people. I then went to the locker room, trying to catch my breath for a second. The anxiety was overwhelming and I just left the place.. biked home feeling even worse then before.. "
jzteug,"I want to pet the black cat in my estate (neighborhood). Late at night I usually go on walks to clear my head, today I went out later than usual and saw a black cat with yellow eyes and it looked really sad. I sat down next to it to tie my laces then went off and after about 20 minutes when I came back it was still there and it came to me and purred sadly. Lately I feel like I'm going crazy with constant anxiety and fake/toxic friends and school work I dont know how to do and Its weird a cat which doesn't even live with me is the one thing keeping me going. I was so tempted to pet the cat, it was at my legs but I just bent down and made eye contact for like 10 seconds unsure as to whether it would mind so I left because im an idiot :( The cats locked outside after 9pm so I dont know if thats normal (no cat flaps in any blocks where I live) Would it be safe to pet it? I'm 16. Also I was always more a dog person but after seeing this cat idk anymore (Sorry if this isn't meant to be in the subreddit) My first time posting 🤧💯 🐈"
cymhj57,"Well, I'm sure you are glad to hear you are not the only one suffering from this, you just described what an average person with SA is anxious to haha.nnYou should definitely try to search for help, or if you want to get better on your own, you should try CBT (Conductive-Behavioral Therapy), which consists on changing the false negative thoughts we tend to think about into realistic thoughts through logical thinking nnExample: You want to go for a run but you are scared of people seeing you running, you could think that people probably won't say you anything and probably they won't even look at you, you can make your brain think this is true and reduce your anxiety a lot. It really works and if you search about it you will note big improvement in your life.nnStay happy man, good luck in your everyday life :Pnn(Btw I love Mr Robot &lt;3)"
fjn4zov,"No idea. I feel it was when I was about 13. I remember going to the park and doing something so embarrassing and stupid that I got judged hugely for it. Looking back, I was a complete and total idiot. I think it was that one thing that ended up ruining my life"
dyfhfei," It's never too late to try something else and to learn something new. What's obvious is that what you've been trying so far, whatever coping skills you have, aren't cuttin' it. Time for 'out with the old, in with the new'. At this point, pretty much \*anything\* you can decide to do different is going to already be better than sticking with the familiar, predictable rut\-enabling routine, aside from actively harming yourself. One meaningful change could be to get your ass in therapy for this, and to approach it with a clear motivation to share your thoughts, get advice, and to assume that what you'll be told may just actually work. Dare to doubt that the way you think about the world may not be as self\-evident as it seems, because you likely WILL feel tempted to dig your heels in and defend doing more of what you're already doing \- more of what's obviously not contributing to your growth or happiness. Dare to assume that you're wrong, because you have a mental health problem that specifically likes to make things seem scarier, heavier, harder, more impossible and hopeless than they really are. Anticipation is almost always worse than the actual thing. Try to let your dissatisfaction fuel you, knowing you can be, feel, do much more than your current mental state is telling you. The question isn't 'whether' you can improve, the question is simply 'how', and looking for that 'how' is allowed to be a journey all by itself. Try stuff, learn stuff, discover things about yourself you may not know yet. Give yourself the chance to be surprised by just how much you haven't learned yet about how to properly look after yourself mentally, about what real self\-esteem can feel like, about how many things you worry about aren't worth worrying over, and how you can self\-regulate your emotions to the point where they stop getting in your way as much. I'm sure you're not even remotely graduated from the class of 'how to live life gud', so tackle that seriously, try to be open to learning new things, and learning how to set a pace that works for you \(including that tough thing of being patient with yourself and having healthy, realistic expectations\). You're allowed to fuck it up along the way, just keep swimming anyway. As long as you don't sit down and quit \(mind, taking a break to recharge isn't quitting or losing\), you won't have lost. This stuff is a life's work, and it's never too late to get crackin' on it. Better to learn how to improve your finesse, experience and life skills now, than to be afraid and look back when you're seventy, regretting that you didn't have the courage now, at the time you're already realizing something needs to be done. If you can't get professional therapy right now, then start with what you CAN do. Start giving yourself small challenges to go from a 95&amp;#37; shut\-in to maybe a 50&amp;#37; shut\-in overtime. Consult free services where you can. Look up relaxation techniques. Buy or borrow a book on ACT therapy, pretty sure that'll be a good investment. Nudge where you can, one thing at a time. Small things add up. At some point you might feel like you can stand a chance job\-hunting \(and I'm sure you have the skills, just not the nerve right now\). Every little thing you can do to go against the grain of this downward spiral will be a victory and take you a bit closer to getting out of this situation. "
n62zgv,"I got approached by someone out on the street. So this happened last week, let me set the scene real quick. Location: Zürich biggest city in the country, starring some stranger and me. I was on a field trip with my class to this Photography museum and after we were done there we had the afternoon to ourselves. After I had a walk along the lake and several anxiety attacks due to how many people were around I decided to back to the trainstation and return to the safety and comfort of my home. As I walked some lady was at the parking meter and approached me cause she didn't have the change to pay, the meter only took 50rp. coins not whole francs. I was really perplexed and almost wanted to run but sadly I freeze in such situations and after I gathered myself I gave her 2 half francs in exchange for a whole one and she thanked me. So I almost had panic attacks but somehow survived a couple hours in the biggest city of the country."
7cizal," How do I not appear ""lonely"" to others?. Hey everyone, so I have a little bit of social anxiety that manifested itself when I moved to a new smallish town for college (a typical college town). I am a transfer student and missed the boat on making friends freshman year, and I do not want to be in a sorority, but it seems like 90% of the girls in my classes are in one. To be honest, I sort of enjoy not having lots of friends, it's less of a distraction, I'm more productive, and I can do whatever I want. I had 2 jobs this semester, and I was in a fashion club and 4 classes so I had lots going on. Now, 2 of those have ended and I just have my classes and a job. In my hometown, I have lots of friends and things to do, and my social calendar is usually pretty busy whenever i'm back home (it's a big city and people are more mature, generally). I really just don't feel like I fit in, and i'm tired of wasting my energy trying to make friends with people who seem to not be interested in being friends. School is going well, I'm kicking ass at my internship, I'm making money, My hobbies are modeling, hiking, and gardening, and I like not having distractions. I just don't have many friends. Last semester, my roommate tried to help by inviting me to things (church youth group type stuff that I really don't enjoy). I went a couple of times but it was just not my thing. I know she was just trying to help, but she said I seemed lonely. Now I'm self-conscious that I seem lonely to my current roommates. I don't have a lot of free time, and when I do, I like just hanging out at the apartment doing chores or just watching TV. Is there a way to not have them think I'm lonely? "
di3216t,"Good for you for taking some initiative &amp; getting out there. That fucking takes guts. As a socially anxious chick who suffers the same apprehensions of the dating realm, I completely get it. nnOnline dating seems almost like a cop out for a lot of people &amp; it robs the organic nature of the experience (all of the tiny but meaningful interactions, nervous glances, flirting, etc.). From what I understand about tinder (or other dating apps), people have been kind of commodified in a sense. It's possible that responses you get could be kind of shallow or superficial. (Source: I watched a few documentaries so I'm automatically a certified expert. Hahah just kidding.)nnHave you maybe considered another way of approaching dating? Maybe, if I may make a suggestion, take a class or attend something where you have interest (an art class or something?) That way, you have a prompt, something to talk about. It's like killing two birds with one stone. You can engage in a cool hobby &amp; maybe meet a cool chick with a similar interest. nnWhen you say that you're looking to see what girls think of you, is that like you're hoping for a little confidence boost? If you're just trying to break into the dating world, then tinder is a good way to really throw yourself out there. Given what apps like that have become, you'll probably be a breath of fresh air for girls just being yourself &amp; being genuinely interested. I guess it depends on what you're looking to get out of dating. nnGood luck! &amp; don't sell yourself short."
f84f1k4, &gt; I honestly dislike all the kids at my school except one person. You might have good taste. &gt; And also the fact that i don’t play a sport makes me depressed and feel like a failure. You can always skateboard or bike. &gt; My best friend is outta town but i don’t wanna feel lame but i don’t have anyone else to talk to so i’m kinda sad. Try to find a few hobby subreddits to spend time in. Being productive is a good distraction from loneliness. 
qj38te," The telltale sign of SAD. The more I familiarize myself with my surroundings, the more afraid I am to leave my room, go to the city, meet people etc. I think having moved cities twice since I used to live at home, I've re-experienced this ""phenomenon"" repeatedly. The first months are kind of lonely and anxiety-inducing in itself. Being in this new room and having to sleep there, wake up there, it definitely comes with a homesick feeling at first... but you can deal with that. The rest feels blissful. It feels like you can do anything. The grass is greener. Everything is new, you feel free. Then you start doing daily things. Going to work or school. You go shopping. You ride your bike to a lake or something, and try various things. Then you start to know certain people, and you think about them when you're going to these places. What if they appear? What do I say if I bump into them? Should I sign up for this university? what if it's the same place my neighbour goes to? Everything I do, I want it to be alone, away from people who could know me. That's how you know it's this self-stigma, and once you start to assicate *places* with *fear*, it stops being fun to go outside your door. That's when you know you have social anxiety. "
gzi8v3," Depressed teenager with social anxiety that needs advice. Hi! I just want to preface this by saying that I’m not diagnosed with social anxiety or anything and I don’t want to assume that I have it. I thought this sub would be most appropriate since I definitely get anxious in certain situations. Anyways, right now I’m a junior in high school so I’ve been out of school for the past 3 months. It’s been nice but now that my school year is done I feel like I need something to go. When school is still going on I spend most of my time studying and working on homework alone in my room. But I now feel like I have to purpose and just sit around all day alone. I’ve wanted to get a job, volunteer, do something for years but just can’t bring up the courage to do so because I get anxious just thinking about calling someone to ask for more information. My sister that’s two years younger than me is getting a job and here I am at 17 and I don’t have a job, can’t drive, and just feel useless and depressed. This has been effecting me for as long as I can remember. I literally have no friends. Haven’t hung out with someone since 7th grade and my anxiety seems to be getting worse and worse. I’m too anxious to even go on a walk around my neighborhood, or go on a hike in the Forest because I’m worried of seeing people from my school. I even get anxious going out to eat or shopping with my family because I’m always worried about seeing people I know. Is it bad that my social anxiety has gotten to a point of influencing everything I do outside of my house? I literally can’t do anything social anymore. I did online school my sophomore year and I feel like everything has just gotten worse since then when I didn’t talk to anybody but my family for over a year. Idk, what do I do? I’m fucking depressed and feel like I’m so much worse than everybody else because I can’t do anything without freaking out and getting extreme anxious. "
df7pmz6," Im the same way and feel your pain. I dont like talking about weekends, etc in fear people think im boring, weird, etc. Im a 20 year old guy in my 3rd year of college with no real friends or girlfriend (i wish i had one really badly it haunts me day in and day out when i see other people with girls, im not ugly, fat, etc, just super shy and fear something will go wrong, it seems no one comes to talk to me either. I never had one before and feel that when i do, the girl will be experienced especially as we get older) I basically go out for school, to run errands, etc. Or i go to my parents house some weekends and stay there all day unless they go places, mostly errands though sometimes we go to the pool, beach, parks, etc. I usually stay home alone though playing video games, watching tv, making videos, homework, etc. Sometimes nothing just sitting on the internet or pacing back &amp; forth aimlessly. I also feel i cant get interested in or learn anything new just the same old stuff, sometimes doing more research on old stuff or discovering more old out of date stuff lol. I had spring break last week and guess what i did lol. I have issues starting conversations with people and talking to girls especially. I recently joing a game development club in school though but of course never say anything while others are talking and joining conversations, i just work on making my game alone. "
fnb025d,"Yeah, so i also feel like i can just do it by bike. I live 10 km from a big city so it's not very far away. And i also don't go out that much so i don't feel like i need it. I have a niece of 25 who doesn't have it either and she is doing fine."
omfghl,"needing reassurance when hanging out with people. I (20F) like being alone sometimes because I’m independent; I’m undiagnosed, but I was wondering if anyone else felt the same as I do. Occasionally I do need some social interaction, but ever since I was a kid, I’ve always felt like no one wanted me to be there. At swim practices, group projects, even friend hangouts. Now I’ve developed this thing where I need someone to literally beg or keep pushing me to come and hang out with them so that I know I am wanted there. I know this probably isn’t healthy and idk if it’s linked to me just being somewhat anxious around people, but I tend to find myself not hanging out with a group of people if no one pushes me to come because I feel like I’m not wanted there and then I have a hard time having conversations with them. And because I am anxious when socializing, I have a hard time telling my friend that I need reassurance too."
fvv6kpm,"I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and say we missunderstand each other. I thought the conversation was about dating. When I talk to strangers it tends to be functional conversations as well. Because I don't camp streets as a desperation attempt to try to get girls numbers. And how the fuck do you know someone has interest in interaction if you've never interacted before. Starting communication in less ebrasive ways is better. Be very active on Tinder and get 50 something functional contacts your first day with some form of romantic intentions. Maybe you're a street master, but I highly doubt this is the case in these settings. Trying to get girls or guys in parks/malls/streets etc is at most really creepy, and at the very least dumb. There are so many more effective contexts and places to meet people romantically, even if you want human interaction that surface level. There's a reason no one seriously tries to start dates this way anymore, it's because dating is so effortless now."
o5in1f, I really want to go to the skatepark. So I've gotten back into skateboarding but till now I've only been riding down the streets near me. Now I really want to go to the skatepark for two reasons: 1. I can do so much more there 2. People say it's a good way to make friends with the same interests But I'm scared to go there alone because well SA but the only person I could go with I don't want to because I don't want friends conected to her because they'll end up being her friends and just hang out with her and I'll be alone again. So I don't know what to do... Do I try and push through the SA and go there alone real awkward and probably just end up turning around and going back home as soon as I see people there? 
ddzv6jm," &gt; The breaking point came a few months before I joined university, it was like a switch flicked in my brain and I suddenly became aware of everything in social situations and easily startled. My peripheral vision is constantly on the look out, I don't look at people, I just observe them from the corner of my eye, it's mentally exhausting just walking anywhere, my ability to focus is pretty much zero. I always felt self conscious and most people do to varying degrees when out in public but this is something way more intense. Had to take a year out of university. Yep. This right here. Sorry you went through that too man, I know how much it sucks. What really benefitted me here was the meditation -- I can quickly catch myself doing that now and center myself. I highly recommend you do that too. &gt;Meditation is so difficult to fit into a routine, I went to a transcendental meditation course and it requires 40-50 minutes per day. Not at all! 20 minutes if you don't have much time. Just practice mindfulness; put on some nature sounds (running water is best) on headphones and breath normally, focusing on the sounds. Gently guide yourself back if you feel yourself drifting off, and always be loving and forgiving. You're gonna drift at first, A LOT. Part of the process. &gt; As taboo a subject it may sound, I've also found nofap to be a help, there are some myths and exaggerations to its benefits but definitely worth a try for at least a couple of weeks. For people like us, addiction is something used to fill the void in our hearts. Fapping is one. If you were addicted to masturbation (no judgement if you are, happens to the best of us) NoFap is very helpful for rewiring your mind and reward system. &gt;If you don't mind me asking, what line of employment are you in and does what you describe hold you back from doing what you want to do? I actually work in software lol, so I've got it easy in that regard. However I am certainly distant from most of my coworkers. I had a really bad stretch of a few months where I was descending to what felt like insanity. Horrible anxiety, hearing people talk shit about me in my head, etc. Got my shit together now and I'm suddenly calm, witty, and talkative if they strike up a conversation. It must seem so ODD to them -- I went from quiet, awkward, uncomfortable, etc. to the opposite almost instantly. I still have huge trouble wanting to go out. I have fun when I do, but hitting someone up and, say, going to the bars to hang always feels like such a chore. I know in the back of my mind that this has to change or I'll be all alone and still single a year from now. &gt;This is my final semester and I'd love to go and teach in China for a year because I feel I've missed out on so much but at the same time I don't know if I'll be ready You can do it. Seriously. The best advice I've gotten is to embrace the anxiety. Analyze it and see what it's trying to teach you. Then make it your bitch. I took a trip to Montreal with a friend and it was fucking great. Saw the sights, went to music festivals, etc. Did I have anxiety? Yeah. Was it worth it? Yes. Did I feel better emotionally afterwards? YES. Go to China. EDIT: **Things to do now until you go to China:** * Clean up your diet. That means no sugars, and low carb if you want. But seriously, no sugars, and NO SODA. If you have snack food or soda as you're reading this, throw that shit out. NOW. ;) *Corollary: Intermittent fasting. That means you have a 8 hr feed time/ 16 hr fast time. Example: Eat from 11 am to 7 pm. Only water or tea, not counting supplements like magnesium, during fasting. * Start running along with your weights. Running is SO nice, I always feel refreshed afterwards. It's a feeling unique to running that you can't get from lifting. * Supplments: I recommend fish oil, magnesium, vitamin d3, and a good chelated B-Complex. Kratom is also really good, but it can be addictive, similar to coffee, so don't use it if you think you can't control your intake. * Meditation: White Light Healing Meditation is awesome if you have 30 minutes. Otherwise just do mindfulness. Look up videos on YouTube. There are loads of other meditation techniques, I highly suggest you look into them too. EDIT 2: I almost forgot, look up Wim Hof's breathing techniques and cold water therapy. Shit is like magic, seriously. "
dzccyi3," I wouldn't blame it on other people to be honest. It's just really difficult for me to make friends, it's been like this my whole life. If someone else were in my place they would probably be having the time of their life. EDIT: I wouldn't say the climate is warm either - it's your typical temperate oceanic climate. It's not warm at all in comparison to where I'm from - except in the summer. "
cf9o8g," I wanna go and sit on the rocks by the lake as I wait for my dad to be picked up.. I had to drop my dad off somewhere and I have an hour or so to waste, so I decided to come to the lake (which is nearby, and actually by my college too lmao fun facts) to chill. I wanna sit out on the rocks, but I’m scared to because I wonder if that looks weird as shit?? There are people here but they’re together and Im just here by myself wasting time. I wanna walk on the trails and stuff but ugh i can’t seem to leave my car. AHhhh I just wanna sit by the lake because it’s relaxing :( "
eq7o6h1," I love the beach, water in general, outdoorsy stuff, animals, and trying new foods/beers. I’m 22 y/o girl from Florida. You? "
fnyekyf," Oh my god, that’s been my entire senior year. There was one girl in my p.e. Class and my lunch who was gorgeous and also just super nice and inviting. I wanted to at least be friends with her, but I was scared to be around her because of the previously mentioned gorgeous things. Every time I was around her I needed to run the other way. Short and to the point, I was too scared to talk to her anymore, she stopped coming up to me, and she hated me ever since. "
erb124q," I'm still struggling but I've got one good friend and one see sometimes friend now. The good friend initiated everything at the start. One thing that helps is getting a meaningful hobby. Running, drawing, baking, hiking etc. The hobby helps to keep your spirits up and your mind off things. Some hobbies allow you to start improving over time, such as running or drawing, and seeing the improvements helps to keep your spirits up. The hardest thing I've learned is that you don't make friends quickly. Not good ones anyway. Most people are slow to open up. Sooo, while I would still advise you to go to meet ups, don't expect much from them initially. You will have to go repeatedly, and force yourself to talk to people in the meet ups, before you make friends. And you will unfortunately meet some people who just aren't interesting in finding new friends :( "
fyzrv25," Well, I read other people's experiences online and I guess that feeling like you're faking it is quite common. The thing is that it's interfering with my daily life (when I go out and ESPECIALLY during the school year) but I also have days when I feel okay (or maybe that's because during the quarantine I've only gone outside a couple of times). For example let's say I'm meeting up with friends. I feel really anxious on the way when I'm still alone, but once I arrive to where me and my friends are supposed to meet I get better (I do still have negative thoughts here and there but it's usually not that bad. Except for if my friends are speaking loudly or doing something stupid. Then the anxiety appears). Maybe I just feel safer when I'm with people I know. So my question is, do you feel anxious pretty much all the time (including when you are at home/ with friends or family) or no? "
qn1phq,"Physical disability causing me social anxiety. Hi 23 year old female here. I just really want to rant and again some advice on what to do because I’m loosing my mind over this. So Ive been diagnosed with muscle weakness in my legs ever since I was born. I was told I would end up in a wheelchair by the age of 14 but I actually never did and I am very grateful but I do struggle to walk up stairs one foot a time like any other person would. And I struggle with jumping high , running, and tend to walk a little funny that’s it’s noticeable if you really watch me. Well I’m also a medical assistant which causes me to see patients all day walk around you know and there have been a few patients to ask me to my face do you have a disability. And I’m very insecure about this disability so I really don’t like speaking about it none of my friends know about it and I tend to hide it Because I’m just is embarrassed of myself. Well one of the doctors I work with asked me about it and she was like oh I noticed how you walk what is wrong? I was really offended and lied to her and my heart raced and it felt like I was having a panic attack over it. I just feel like everyone is constantly watching me and thinking I’m a abnormal freak and it’s really getting me sad. I’m so stressed out my hair is falling out and I just don’t even feel human. I think my co workers are all making fun of me and are noticing too. I never leave me house or see friends due to my disability because I don’t want to seem like i can’t walk and I rather not explain the situation. I usually just stay in my room other than go to work. Anyone know a similar situation or have advise please let me know."
dfzcoqq,"For me it's the oposite, I love making eye contact with complete strangers, especially with girls, I apreciate their pretty faces, I love to look at them and their faces/eyes even if I only look them for one or two seconds..., and I don't know, making eye contact is the last thing that make me feel ""existing"" I think...nnWith family and people I know it's a different story. Few years ago I had a time where looking my parents in the eyes was painfull, hopefully it didn't last and now I can malke eye contact with them without problem...nnAnd about walking, I love walking especially in parks (I try to go everyday in parks), not only because it makes my back better (being on a seat during all day is terrible for my spine) but because I can have some fresh air and enjoy the weather for example... but even in such situation I feel some intense anxiety and even if I enjoy eye contact with people, the anxiety is still there and I feel like I'm being strongly judged by others... nnSo I'm asking myself, how does it feels to being able to simply walk without fear and without having the false feel that I'm being judged by others.... must be a wonderfull feeling. ï£¿Ã¼Ã²Â¢"
g7w7qkk, I use to go boxing classes and I was terrified on my first couple days thought the coach would throw me to the sharks. Strangely these fighting trainers actually turn out to be the nicest of people. Guess they get there aggression out another way lool I would be dead if I tried to roller skate that's pretty good that you can balance. Do you write poetry or just like reading it? And writing erotica seems like a hobby we would all enjoy loool 
dkdtzu2," I'm skinny too and I'm also pretty insecure about it. What helps me though is seeing other people that are also skinny! It's actually pretty damn common so no one will care in the slightest. As for skin colour, well, there's nothing to fret there either! Racists are very rare these days especially those that hate pale skin in the west. If you were in the middle east then yeah *some* people would stare at you. You're in Germany though so again, no one will really care! :) Best of luck and have fun swimming!! "
elt7jjk,"You need to first slowly regain your self esteem and get over the fear (at fjrst you can just walk in the park, then small talks.? Then you can earn the social skills(you can read books about it.) After this, choose your hoobies and start doing them. And if you followed and sucseed, you can now be a normal person, and you can do what you want (Job, Find urself, idk) Im just 14 and this is just my opinion. (english isnt even my primary languaue.) I hope you will sucseed and regain your personality!"
rgwdmv," I have to go outside today. I‘m already dreading it, I’m genuinely so terrified that I feel like I’m going to throw up. I would genuinely rather die than feel like this. I really don’t think I will ever be able to live a normal life, my anxiety is way too bad. "
k7dkl1," 2021 12 Month Challenge!. Since the new year is approaching, I figured I'd create a challenge for you all! Sometimes self-improvement can really help when it comes to social anxiety. I'm already in a very similar process at the moment (I post a progress post on my profile every day if you want to check it out). The reason I say this is to say that the purpose of this post is simply to give you all some ideas on ways you can improve yourselves in 2021. The power of incremental improvement is amazing. **January: Setting a Wake-Up Time** * The four pillars of health are sleep, fitness, healthy eating, and having a good social life. Let's work on fixing your sleep first. Before focusing on a consistent sleep-time, it is key to work on waking up at the same time every day. You get to pick a time, but make sure that it is relatively early. 8 am is an excellent choice, for example. **February: Setting up a Seep Time** * Now that you are consistently waking up at the same time every day, you might have noticed that you might be tired some days. This is because your sleep time might not be consistent. 8 hours of sleep is a good target, but if you feel that it is too much or too little you can change it. Your goal here is to be in bed at the same time every night. It might help to also set a time for when you need to get ready for bed. A night routine might take time and shouldn't be rushed. **March: Performing Deep Work** * Now that your sleep is fixed, you might notice that you have plenty of extra time during the day. You will use this time to indulge in at least 1 hour of deep work per day. Deep work is defined as an activity performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. Writing, studying, and coding are some examples. You can also spend your time producing your own content. The book ""Deep Work"" talks in detail about deep work, and the difference between deep work and shallow work. **April: Hitting the Gym** * Now that your sleep is fixed and you're working on your brain muscles, it's time to start working on your actual muscles. The goal here is to go to the gym 3-5 days per week and perform strength training. The book ""Bigger Leaner Stronger"" is a great book that talks about this and provides a workout routine. Also, don't forget to stretch after your workouts! We don't want you getting injured. **May: Doing Cardio** * Now that you've successfully worked on creating the habit of working on your muscles 3-5 days a week, the next goal is to add cardio into the mix. You can do this after your workouts or you can do it during your rest days. Cardio can include running, swimming, hiking or even walking. The goal is to have 2 sessions per week. HIIT is also a good example of cardio. A good idea might be to do HIIT one day and to do low intensity cardio another day. **June: Eating Healthy** * Wow, look at all your progress. You're going to bed at the same time every night, you're waking up early every day, and you're working on your brain and on your physical muscles. Now it's time to focus on what you're putting into your body. You will start eating healthy every day. Less carbs, more fruits and vegetables, no deep fried food, no unnatural foods, no unhealthy preservatives, no soft drinks, lots of protein... the list goes on. Furthermore, you are to drink at least 2 litters of water per day, as water is also a big part of nutrition. There is a lot of information online about what constitutes as healthy eating. The book mentioned above is a good example. You can still eat food that tastes good. Chipotle, for example, tastes amazing. Another example is dark chocolate. You can by all means have a couple pieces of dark chocolate with your tea. The more proper research you do, the more you'll understand what is healthy and what isn't. The goal for this month is to implement a healthy lifestyle. **July: Taking Social Risks** * The first three pillars of health have already been talked about. Now it's time to do something about your social life. Your goal here is to take 1 social ""risk"" per day. This can be something as simple as texting an old friend and asking if they would like to have a phone call to catch up. This can be something like asking a cute girl/guy if they would like to get coffee with you. This can be something like sending an email to an old professor and asking how they've been. This can be something like asking your friends if they'd like to hang out during the weekend and setting up a plan. The goal here is to get busy socially and to get in contact with more people. **August: Teeth Care** * Wow congrats! You are a healthy person now. You are working on strength training and cardio every week. You are eating healthy. You have an amazing sleep schedule. You have an awesome social life. You are performing deep work every day on projects you find interesting. Next up, it's time to work on preventing future health problems. The best way to start this is by working on your teeth. The goal here is to brush your teeth properly twice a day and to floss once per day. You can watch videos on YouTube if you'd like or you can set up an appointment with your dentist. You are to no longer half-ass your teeth care. I want you to have the cleanest set of teeth out of everyone. **September: Skin Care** * There is a great subreddit on the topic of skin care on reddit. The three pillars of a beginner routine are to have a good moisturizer, to have a good cleanser and to have a good suncream. You are to go to that subreddit and learn how to create your beginners' routine with those three products. Then you are to purchase those products and apply them every day in the manner that is set out in your routine. **October: Meditating** * Wow look at you! 9 amazing habits so far. You have transformed into a better version of yourself. But you're not done yet. Next, we will work on calming your brain by meditating every day. There are some great meditation apps, such as Headspace and Calm available. The goal is to divide the month into 4 parts. The first week, you do 5 minutes of meditation per day. The second week, 10 minutes. Third week, 15 minutes. Finally, on the last week of the month you do 20 minutes per day. After the month is over you can return back to doing at least 5 minutes per day moving forward. **November: Limiting Phone Use** * The next goal is to limit instant gratification. We live in a world where we are constantly plugged into the internet and into our smartphones. The best way to tackle this issue is by starting with what that is often most used, and most unhealthy - your smart phone. You are to set a 1 hour limit for each day (unless of course you absolutely need to use it for work or for an emergency or something). The point is to limit the use of apps such as YouTube, Instagram and things of that nature on the smartphone. You can spend your new time on things like reading or other hobbies. **December: Helping People** * Look at you! You have become a healthy individual. Now it's time to help others! You are to perform one act of ""helping"" per day. This can be something as simple as giving money to a homeless person. You could also go on subreddits that talk about depression and suicide, for example, and direct message a user who is going through a hard time. There are numerous ways we can be kind and help others. Your help and kindness must be genuine here. You goal is to take a little bit of time every day to be kind and to help someone. **Final thoughts:** * It's amazing how much progress can be made in one year simply by focusing on one habit per month and then by adding a new habit the following month. There are many other habits that I wish I could have fit into this 12-month plan, but I believe these 12 are the most important for people just starting out. There is, however, one habit that needs to be mentioned. This is the habit of taking care of your finances. During the year, when you are focusing on the 12 habits mentioned above, make sure to keep this one in mind. Make sure that you are being smart about your purchases and that you are learning about money management, and things like investing and saving. With that being said, I wish you all all the best in this journey! Remember that you don't need to use this exact plan laid out. You can make your own changes. I can't wait to see you come out the other end of 2021 as improved individuals! "
50icnj," My social anxiety.. I've been seriously depressed for about 4 years.I absolutely hate being around people. And if they're people I don't know? Fuck that I'm outta there. I've been suffering from this as long as I can remember and I'm just 17. I'm a decent guy. I have a pretty good sense of humor. But no one knows that. Surprisingly, everyone knows me at my school and they even hang out with a couple of guys like me. I could be one of the guys they hang out with but the only thing holding me back is my anxiety. I go out to play Basketball at odd times just to avoid other people. 2 weeks ago this guy who's pretty popular in my grade asked me something and I took 10 seconds to get a word out and even then I stuttered a bit. I noticed that he was fine with it but it ate me up for the next 4-5 days. It's just so hard to accept that anxiety is literally preventing me from being happy and not depressed. "
r7idnp,"Ruined a Good Potential Relationship due to my SA. I've (23M) recently come to terms with how social anxiety has affected my life and I feel I have to get this off my chest. Early 2020 I met a girl (22F) through mutual friends at a party and she messaged me afterwards on Insta to get to know me. She was very obviously into me based on what she said and I liked her so we were getting to know each other over text when the lockdowns hit. This went on for several months with messages and phone calls and we decided to hang out at the beach when we felt things were safe. I told myself I would confess to her when we were there... and of course I didn't because I was scared. Over the next few weeks we still talked but it became less and less frequent and eventually it got to the point where she had gotten a boyfriend somewhere else. I was so mad at myself for this, I had a good thing going and I was too frozen up due to my anxiety to try. Now this year I recently learned they're engaged and since we have similar friend groups it's going to be hard to see them as a reminder of what could have been. Overall, I am happy for them both because I care about them. I won't be bitter about it and I will try to use that mistake as a learning opportunity for the future. I hope any of you can take something away from this as well. Thank you :)"
f8dr7q,"I feel like a criminal. To me going to the shop is unbearable, to be able to go I have to do it with my little brother (15yo, I'm M18yo), and I have to be talking all the time or else I'll transform into a insecure mess, and I'm not a very talkative person I just don't want to be left alone with my thought that everyone is watching me. Brother tells me there's nothing to be afraid of, and I 100% agree, It's a beautiful day outside but the fact that there are PEOPLE EXISTING near me triggers an instintive state of fight or flight in me. It's feel like I'm some low-life delincuent or wanted criminal and everyone knows it but doesn't say anything they just give me this weird look, and I KNOW my anxiety is making this up, but it's just a natural reaction like blinking and I hate it. Brother often tells me I look pretty much normal when I ask him if I look weird, and that I act perfectly natural with people and I say yeah? Did my acting look natural? It seems I can act pretty well when I'm nervous. When I'm outside in a no good mood I can be very hostile because of the anxiety, if I look like an irreverent asshole, I tell you, I feel worse than I look like."
nmnam6,"Does anyone else get really anxious when paying with a credit/debit card in public?. I’ve had social anxiety for years now, and I’ve been slowly making progress towards overcoming it, however I just can’t seem to get over this issue no matter what I do. For as long as I can remember I’ve always gone out of my way to pay with cash, for some reason paying with credit/debit cards scares me like no other. When I was younger I tried paying with my mom’s card when I was outside alone since she didn’t have any cash on hand to give me, and let me tell you, everything that could’ve gone wrong went wrong. After bagging everything I tried to pay for it, even though I did exactly what my mom told me it wasn’t working, a worker comes by and asks if I need any help which makes me feel 10x more anxious than I already did. After standing there for 15 minutes, holding up the line while calling my mom on the phone it went through. Walking out of the store I could feel my heart pounding, I felt like I was going to pass out and throw up at the same time. I haven’t been able to pay with a card since. When you pay with cash, you have the physical money in your hand so nothing can go wrong. When I try to pay with a card my mind starts racing and I feel sick, I start thinking about everything that can go wrong, despite it being unlikely. “What if the card declines? What if I type in the wrong pin? What if I choose debit instead of credit, or vice versa? It’s such an annoying issue that I just don’t know how to overcome. I was curious whether anyone else has a similar issue and if anyone has any idea on how to overcome it, I would very much appreciate it!"
clkzum,"Just Venting. I absolutely can't stand when people try to force me to talk. Not even at least by asking me things that might help them get to know me. ""She's so quiet. She doesn't talk. Why don't you talk"". It makes my anxiety even worse. I don't love this new job because it's already hard enough for me to make connections with new people but I can't talk to these people at all. I go there to get paid and that's it. It was much different at my old job. I was still for the most part quiet but I felt like I could be myself when I wanted to. My old coworkers were like a little family. It's also hard making friends as an adult even outside of work. I feel weird. I don't know how to approach people and start conversations without being awkward. Going out with my boyfriend and his friends give me anxiety. I feel much more comfortable just us 2 but I want to be able to hang out with other people too. I met them earlier this year to go camping and I swear I just wanted to be alone or go home most of the time."
gnk2a6,"I don't know what to do about my friends. Hello, I am a 20 year old male back home from college (going to be a junior next year. So this whole quarantine thing has felt kinda nice for me socially not going to lie. I usually prefer not to hang out with people too much, I don't feel like I'm the best at social interaction and a lot of the times I find myself out with people and I just want to go home. So I have taken the chance given to quarantine and not seen anyone for the most part, very rarely I will text with a friend for a little bit, but it is never too long of a conversation. Anyways, about 3-4 weeks ago one of my best friends from high school got back from his self isolation at his college. He texted in a group chat (w/ about 5 ppl form high school) if anyone wanted to hangout and him another friend and myself ended up playing tennis for an hour or so. Then they wanted to hangout later at their house but I didn't really feel like it so I lied and said my mom doesn't want me over at people's house because of the virus. Fast forward, to now and I have been completely ignoring the texts in our group chat. My said best friend personally texted me if I was doing alright, and I just completely ignored the text because I didn't know how to respond, and that was last Friday. I don't know what to do about how I should respond or say anything next. I am scared I might end up losing this friend but I feel awkward and stupid because I haven't been saying anything for awhile. Does anyone have any advice for me? TLDR: I've have been completely ignoring friends during quarantine, not responding to texts. I feel bad about it but end up being okay after awhile of just putting it out of my mind. But I'm starting to wonder am I gonna lose these friends because of it? Advice?"
dlwyavw,"Why do I feel like IT as a whole is growing increasingly unwelcoming for us with social anxiety? Sometimes I wish I had choosen a different uni. All bigger companies around here now use open spaces and agile and have constant ""team building"" activities. :-/ "
dr18vpa," I try my best to see the world from a further perspective like look, the universe is so big, nothing matters, we don't matter, our actions don't matter and will be forgotten, even with this mentality i can't do anything, it feels hopeless...but i've heard confidence is like a muscle if you train it the stronger it gets... I'm 100% sure i'm gonna hate myself again for not ''just going for it'', I hate this feeling of not being able to even try, I know i will fail but i'm still gonna try, i take that risk. If i fail i wont ever see her again, that's FINE. If i try i maybe have a change of WINNING. If i don't try the feeling gets WORSE. I don't want to be that person but i think those people are right... I mean ''just going for it'' seems to be the only way out of this nightmare, fuck this world, I am going to try again tomorrow. And again, and again, and again. Maybe i can update if i success, I always took life way to seriously even though i know nothing matters at all...Life is just a playground... "
6dpvxo," how to improve my situation? do I really have social anxiety?. I have trouble pinning down what I need to work on in order to improve my situation. I'm very unsatisfied with my social life. I've even been in therapy before (no medication, just behavorial stuff), but my therapist said he doesn't think I have a severe case of social anxiety. I don't care if I have a ""severe case of social anxiety"" or not - being afraid of other people's judgement has been what's holding me back since forever. Sorry this is a wall of text but getting it off my chest really helped just now: I would describe myself as an extroverted and outgoing person. At least when I'm with people I'm familiar with. I also have no troubles holding presentations; during my teens I've been into acting and I didn't even have a problem with acting a play in front of a crowd of several hundred people. But no matter where I am, I feel like I'm trapped inside a bubble. I've been having nightmares about this, too. I feel confined to my 1-room apartment (even though I leave it all the time for uni/ work/ meetin w friends). Doesn't sound like I was having a problem, right? I can function around other people and people might even perceive me as self confident. But in fact, I'm always building a wall, I'm always second guessing everything I do. And I get panic attacks where I start sweating, my eyes get wet and I feel dizzy. And I get panic attacks with the most normal stuff: going to the barber shop, going to the supermarket. Whatever. Any location that has lots of people around. Last night I was at this club. I went with a friend and we split up soon after entering. I had one of my panic attacks and had to leave like half an hour later. Didn't talk to anyone. I knew this would happen, but I've always kept thinking ""hey, if I push myself it'll eventually get better"". But it doesn't get better. I feel like I'll never be able to enjoy myself around other people. Even the smallest things like grocery shopping are a huge stressful task for me. And it happens all the time that I get into (mostly minor) problems because of this. Running out of food bc I couldn't bring up the energy to go to the super market is the most common example. And I'm so damn ashamed about this, too. I mean, who runs out of food because he was too afraid to do grocery shopping yesterday?? I'm also incapable of meeting new people because of this. And this is the most horrible thing. I've been on like 3 dates in my entire life (I'm 24) simply because I'm not meeting enough girls I'm interested in. If I should happen to have a female acquaintance I'm attracted to, it wouldn't even be that big of a deal for me to ask her out. But this first step from turning a stranger into an acquaintance is something I'm not capable of. Not capable of, at all. Regardless of gender, age or whatever. Right now, I'm about to graduate from uni. And I'm alone all the time. Before, I had classes where I occasionally met new people. Now I don't. I'm too socially anxious to keep clinging to the people I hung out with last semester because everyone of them too is dealing with their own life right now and they don't seem to be interested in hanging out in this constellation again. I would've loved to make friends at this club last night, but I'm obviously too anxious to do that. Thing is, I don't really understand what to do about my situation. I'm 24 already and really not socially inept. But these panic attacks are what's holding me back. And I simply don't know what I need to work on so my situation gets better. Right now, I've been contemplating about pushing myself to go buy a beer and just sit on a park bench. I could do that, if I really wanted, I guess. It would be super exhausting, however. And the thing is, I would still not meet others just by sitting on a bench on a sunny afternoon. Other people always seem so casual about making new acquaintances. I'm so envious. I feel my life is horrible. I've had a lot of depressive episodes. And honestly, I feel my incapability of making new friends and connecting with other people is what makes my whole life a horrible experience. "
cvl7tcb,"My social anxiety has actually improved my writing skills, primarily poetry, a lot. I'm able to better appreciate nature, and the little things when I'm by myself. I'm also able to read ALOT; Shelley, Byron, Tennyson, Wilde, Dickinson. And the list goes on. Most people might not be like this but I would have to say SA improved my writing skills or at least provided the environment for/catalyzed them. "
g59lmlh, Actually that is true but for me I still get stares from people even though I feel less anxious when going outside with mask but when I see people staring at me I will start getting anxious 
anj0lq,"Sitting alone by myself in a classroom ,upstairs my school 🌇. My school is on a hill and its quite beautiful being 3 stories high I hate school but I love school. I hate school because of the people I love it because its beautiful After school you hear the little voices of the people still hear,you can feel the wind ,the sun as it reaches the horizon .Nothing like this feeling. I always get anxious when I'm at school ,but when its after school here I feel relaxed,thinking to myself ""hey, it would be nice to paint this or play my guitar"" As the voices fade away"
faneun0," What you wrote has similarities to what I went through and I would like to share my journey with you. I had social anxiety for about 8 years, it has taken me about 2 years to overcome it, I'm 25 now. When my social anxiety was really bad, I often thought about just ending my life, like how easy it would be to just cross the road in front of a truck, fall off a cliff or swallow a few pills. I think what kept me going was a promise I made to myself that I would try everything I possibly could to overcome it before doing anything rash. To my amazement I learnt so much other stuff about myself in the process, like how to motivate myself, gain mental toughness, nurture my health and overcome other fears/anxieties. It's important to know that who you portray yourself as to the world, is not a fixed image of identity, it changes with experience. When I had social anxiety I felt like an empty shell. I would shape shift my personality to try and fit into different groups. In an attempt to surround myself with friends I would often be overly generous and considerate. More often than not that generosity would not be reciprocated but at the time I didn't care. When it came to finding a girlfriend, if a female showed interest in me, I would latch onto them. If I showed some vulnerability to them via text and then they didn't reply, I would send message after message as if I was interpreting what they were thinking. This ultimately led to obsessive behavior which only drove them away and then made me think something was fundamentally wrong with me. Then I became addicted to porn and was introduced to drugs/alcohol. To me they were ways I could escape reality. But while I was away on my great escape reality continued, opportunities would come and go and people would pass in and out of my life. Everything started to change when a friend that I was fond of kicked me out of her house, she said I saw the world like a big marshmallow and I should go to the army of something similar to develop mental hardness. Well I spent the next 6 months wallowing in my grief, playing video games, smoking pot, and over eating. I was experiencing something called brain fog at the time, I'm not sure if you're familiar with it. Anyway I did copious amounts of research and then stumbled across NoFap, a Reddit group. I then discovered how my brains reward system worked and realized the impact of everything I was doing. I also came across a group called the Landmark forum, they helped me make sense of my past and allowed me to start thinking about a future for myself.....sorry now I'm getting off topic. Key things I helped along my journey include: \- Trusting that my brain will respond in conversation as long as I listen \- Practicing being in the moment. The wind blowing over my hairs, the sun on my skin, the sounds of the animals, the taste in my mouth, the smell of the air...more detail the better and practice often. \- Teal Swan videos. Things we don’t like about other people are often things we don’t like about ourselves. Emotional healing of the body. I recommend starting with ""What is shadow work - Teal Swan"" \- Accepting the way I look and that this is the only body that I’ll have until I pass away. I started going to the gym, swimming, flossing, brushing, washing my face and wearing clothes that I liked. \- NoFap. This is my latest challenge but the rewards are everything I wanted. Increased energy, confidence, motivation. \- We are meaning making machines, the way we think is a product of our surrounding environment. The way you think would be completely different to the way someone else thinks because they're exposed to a different environment. Change what you surround yourself with to think differently. \- Practice looking at the facts of what actually happened and realize the rest is you making a story to give it meaning. \- Being vulnerable and letting people in on how I feel without a care of looking stupid \- Exercise and good nutrition boosts mood \- Look at patterns of behavior that reoccur in your life and deconstruct it on a piece of paper. \- Changing the thoughts you have, changes the actions you take, which changes the experiences of your life, which changes the emotions you experience which change or reinforce the thoughts you have and so on. I'm aware you said that you're in school and so a lot of what I said is beyond what you might experience at this current time. I'm sure I left some stuff out. Some of things I said I didn't flesh out and elaborate on. If you have questions please ask. The main point I'm emphasizing is that you can change the way you see yourself, other people, and the world. "
5n8lyi," 23 years old male. Never kissed a girl. Don't know what to do with myself.. Help me. Okay I've always had trouble speaking to people, and as scary as it is, I'm typing this because something has to change. I'm a 23 year old dutch guy. I'm tall, a little on the chubby side but nothing too bad, and when being rational I know I should have no trouble on any front. Yet I have never had sex or even kissed a girl, and though it feels stupid, any more than friendly interaction frightens me to the bone. I don't get accepted at jobs because I'm terrible at interviews. I still don't have my driver's license because I kept failing by my anxiety. I know I'm not bad looking. Ofcourse I'm not the superstud, but I'm definitely not unattractive. My mind knows that, but my subconscious just doesn't seem to agree. I'll even add a [couple](of [pics](Whenever a girl seems the least bit interested in me, and I am interested as well, I completely shut down. I have always been insecure about myself, I used to get bullied while I was younger. And while I didn't get physically abused or something, I do feel like my parents and their divorce and their new SOs really f'ed me up.. It's not just love though. My father has always been a man of few words. My father used to be work 5 days in the week, so I only saw him in the weekends. I've taken it over. I'm the calm one. I don't talk a lot, conversating kept getting harder and harder. I like being with other people, but when close to confident people I just feel like shit. They talk with confidence and like they're testosterone filled bulls, and I just get lost and get more quiet. My father got remarried. When my parents got divorced I changed every week between their houses, a bit annoying, but hey, I loved the both of them. He had some girlfriends, some good some bad, but then there came Amanda. She could not stand having us in the same house as him. During dinner she would sit sideways as to not look at us, would only respond to my dad and needless to say we fought a lot. One sister left. My other sister left. I was alone for two years. I used to work nightshifts at local cafes and such, it was my mothers week, and the one night I left my keys at the workplace. It had already closed, and it was about 4am. So I rode my bike to my fathers, rang the bell lots, my phone died so I couldn't call. I even yelled to their window. They didn't open. But the fucked up thing was, I heard her talking to him. It was about 5c outside, I stood there for an hour, before I gave up and left. That next day I moved out of my fathers house. I am still mad about that night. Moving out did help though. We talk again, and when I'm visiting we're actually nice to eachother. My mother and I have real issues tho. With her it started before the actual divorce. I was maybe 10/11? when I read texts on her phone from a guy named Robbert. (My parents divorced because of her cheating, but not this guy.) She told me those texts were just from a colleague, and me being a oblivious 11 year old believed it then. Fast forward two months after the actual divorce, and we're introduced to Robbert. Her lover. He is the person I hate the most in my life. I blame him for a lot of my issues.. He made Amanda look like a Disney princess. Nobody in the family liked him. He was obnoxious, loud and just a terrible human. He made my mother start smoking again. She promised she would stop, I've got asthma, but she never did. My room was next to theirs. Each night he was over I heard them. They did not care, how much we yelled at them and asked them to at least do it in my fathers weeks. Each time she'd tell she loves me and would stop if it hurt me. It just continued.. My mom became an alcoholic after the divorce. Do you know how hard it is as you're a beginning puber, to see your mother being drunk every night. We made her change her life. We made her go to AA meetings. Yet each time Rob came over, he brought a box of wines. She said she didn't drink, but everyday I kept finding hidden beer cans. Bottles that shouldn't have wine in it. All that lying hurt man. That shit fucking hurts. I have trust issues with her to this day. That man was evil. I got bullied in school, but he was the worse bully. He called me nerd and idiot. He once told me perhaps I would be better off if I just killed myself. Believe me, I wanted to. One sister fled the house, the other too, once she was old enough to live by her own. I never felt so alone. Thank god it didn't last. I don't believe in god but thank god they broke up. Her alcoholism stopped (Still refuses to admit he was the cause). We still had problems though. I got older and rebellious. I liked gaming and was gaming with friends on skype every night. My whole family is kinda anti-gaming tho. Being on skype and chatting and gaming with people made me feel the most sociable in years, yet my family did not see it that way. They didn't get it. Why are you talking on skype? Do it outside! Gaming is not a real hobby. It is bad for you. In the evenings they forced me to watch tv with them, though I'd rather go back skyping and playing some cod or something. My mom now has a boyfriend. We moved to his house. He is a nice guy, but I don't think he likes me. He's kinda ignorant. He works at a school, nothing too special. But in his mind he's made it. And while that's fine, he always criticizes me for haven't really achieving anything. Why don't you have a girlfriend yet? Why don't you have your license yet? Why don't you have a degree yet? It's kinda frustrating, but after all other SOs I really appreaciate him. I really don't know what to do anymore. I'm depressed. I can't get out. For god's sake I'm 23 already. I don't know how to kiss and I am terrified of my first kiss. What is wrong with me? People like me. I am the chill guy who's friends with everybody, I'm a hard worker who comes off a bit slow. I built this facade around me, I'm really good at keeping up appearance. I even work at the hottest cafe in town. **I just do not get it.** This is the first time I've actually openly spoken about this. I need you guys. I don't know what else to do. Strange thoughts have been creeping around my head. tl:dr 23m never kissed a girl. Lots of troubles when younger made my self esteem go down hard. I'm depressed af and even though I'd never kill myself, I think about it every day. Something has to change. A thanks in advance Edit: Seriously thank you guys. You made my week. I'll take your advice and start looking some professional help. And try to find some daily activities to keep my mind of of things. I'll try and update at a later point! "
oitu6d,"I was brave enough to get over my SA to have the first sex experience of my life. I (23M, gay) has been suffered from SA my whole life and I think you all can understand how hard it is for life. Before age 23, I focused most on my university studies so I don't pay much attention to my sex life. I am a regular masturbator though, and used to think watching porn and masturbation was satisfying enough for me. I don't plan to come out as gay soon because most people around me are homophobics (I think so base on most of their reactions on LGBTQ+ stuff), including my family and closet friends, so I don't even plan to be in a relationship with a guy. They don't even know I have SA and they only think that I'm being too shy and too quiet most times. Until the beginning of this year, I started using Discord to talk a lot about anime and manga (my hobby). It's all text and I didn't dare to voice chat because I'm too shy to talk. After a few weeks I discovered some serves for trading gay porns and gay NSFW chat, and I quite enjoyed these servers. I have dared to voice chat with some guys and of course, dared to try NSFW cam chat. I started to feel like I need more than just masturbation or watching gay porn, I need something new to refresh this same old life. I started some simple work out from home, and jogged around the park nearby every evening (too shy to go to the gym and have to spend another amounts of money for it). After a few weeks my body looks better and started to have some muscles on arms. I got compliments about my body changing from guys I usually have NSFW chat with. That makes me feel absolutely wonderful and more confident about myself. But that's not enough for me. I started to have some fantasies about my sex life, about wanting to cuddle a guy, kiss him, to have his arms around me, about how we will make love, how we will be inside each other. But I think my SA hold me back. I struggled with myself about whether to try having sex with someone. Will I be laughed at by them for lacking of expierence, will I be in awkward situations, will I be enough to satisfy them? These thoughts keep popping up inside my head. But you know, when my horniness reaches its limit, I can’t even think about my SA or any other thing anymore. I want to have sex, I need to have sex. I downloaded Grindr and used a pretty good looking pic of myself as profile pic (without my face but wearing a tank top with my muscle arms). About first 12 hours, there were plenty of guys nearby my location viewed my profile, tapped me and messeged me. I was a little nervous but tried to replied most of them with nice talking. Many of them are good looking with fit body that I’m not confident enough to ask them for fun. There was a guy without profile pic popped up on messege, he is 28 and about 0.6 miles away from me. We asked each other about ourself, he said he would be ok with anyone, he was free at that time, wanted to have fun right away and he was home alone, asked if I could come. I didn't hesitate much, immediately took a shower and ran to his place like a rocket. And then, I had the first sex ever. That indulging in lust was one of the most satisfied moments of my whole life. Walking home after hooking up, in my head was like: “What the hell happened to my social anxiety? Did it disappear for a moment, did I step on my shyness to do the thing that I’ve never even dared to try?” It's as if all my worries and awkwardness are gone and I can be myself. After first hooking up, I stayed in contact with him and we did it for second time, it was even better than first time, I didn’t hestiate at all either. We texted each other everyday and sometimes even NSFW chat, I feel really comfortable talking with him, no matter on his bed or through texts. Of course there are some bouradies between us, and I don’t plan to be in relationship with him but just FwB. I've always felt hesitant to reply to anyone's texts, sometimes even family and friends, and found it difficult to interact with any stranger. But it seems like in that moment, when my sexual needs was high, SA didn't seem to be a big obstacle for me to overcome, of course you need to notice I’m saying it was just “that moment”, maybe because those were my first times having sex. Maybe SA is still a big problem for me to deal with for the next sex with him or with other guys."
deib43j," Yeah, when I run into people I lived with a year ago at the dorms, they're always very kind and we can hold a decent conversation. But I never think to reach out and ask to grab a coffee to catch up, because the thought running through my mind is ""why would they want to hang out with me?"" It's an awful, awful mindset, something I need to break. On doing stuff alone, I study on a big urban campus, and I see people eating, studying, even sitting on a bench alone. Most people need alone time. I don't think people give it a second thought, whereas being alone in high school is a terrible thing for anyone to go through. "
dy41yp6,"You have something that will give you a purpose\-\- probably many things\-\- whether that's founding a charity that provides balloons to little kids, creating the world's most delicious salad, running ultramarathons, singing lead in an African travelling band, chaining yourself to redwood trees that would be cut down, making love to retired Norwegian women, whatever ... but you need to go out and find that , whatever it is"
lt6lla, Ever tried dog walking?. Has anyone ever tried dog walking as just a way to make some extra money or maybe in between jobs? I ask because I’m not sure that I’m ready to work a “regular” job but I want to gain some experience working in general and with minimal human interaction. If you did try it how did that go for you? 
g3e53jd," I've always had the same problem with Introducing myself. One of the worst things to go through. I'm sweating just thinking about it. Your writing reminds me so much of myself on first day of high school. Just try to get over with it as fast as possible. It depends on what the teacher means by introducing. Things that they usually ask is to say your name, age, where you live and a hobby Try: So my name is (full name), I'm () years old and I live in (). My hobbies are () or I like to do () I've always had trouble with saying my hobbies because I felt like they were not good enough. I usually said drawing, reading and listening to music. It's pretty basic but a lot of people said those things as well. People don't want to make fun of your hobbies. They are interested to meet you and if you seem interested in your hobby than it's very attractive to others. If you really don't know what to say then use traveling, exercising,cooking, hiking, reading, looking after animals etc. Just try to say at least two things and hope that the teacher will let you go. I usually looked very stressed so they just let me be. I hope this helped somehow. I'm moving to my dorm tomorrow as well I'm terrified. If you need someone to vent or anything else you can't dm me. Good luck! You can do it! "
oafun8," Feel like a broken robot. Okay, so this is kind of like a rant post or whatever, but honestly any advice is absolutely welcome. So, for some time now I've been feeling this way especially when I go around people. I feel inhuman or robot-like but at the same time in a defective/broken way (since robots are usually supposed to be perfect and I'm not). Every single person I see outside or on the internet seems completely normal. They look normal irl and on camera, they behave normally, they have hobbies and are actually good at something and so on. My self-esteem is so bad right now and I feel extremely uncomfortable being outside. I can't help but feel weird, awkward and like everyone is looking at me and judging me. I am constantly aware of the way I look...yet I feel like I have no clue what I look like (?). One of my fears is my family, friends or SO leaving me because of how I look or because of how much of a social reject I am. I've been trying to fix myself and for a few days, maybe a week or two I succeed in doing stuff like working out, going out, staying away from insulting myself. But then very shortly afterwards I just get back in this depressed, anxious, no motivation, neglecting myself and just staying in my room isolated from people state. Everyday I just have to push through being around people and embarrassing myself cause when I have to go to school I have no choice obviously. I feel that way pretty much around everyone which leaves me very confused - is this who I am? I probably have other stuff to add but honestly can't think right now I'm sorry. "
rzszjk," Anxiety has dictated my life. I've had anxiety since I was 9 years old. I remember being scared of going to restaurants, they'd make me feel ill. This then progressed to not wanting to go to my friend's parties because I didn't like to eat in front of people. Then it turned into avoiding social situations altogether. Now, even going into a supermarket makes me anxious. When I was at university, not wanting to socialise didn't concern me much. I saw myself as an introvert. I didn't want social connections. A friend = more chance of them wanting to hang out with me = anxiety. I was particularly anxious at parties and social gatherings so unless I met them whilst working (one friend I did), I wouldn't been friends with them. I'm now 23 (male), and I'm still seeing my anxiety dictate my life. I currently work from home and often won't leave the house unless it's to do food shopping. I have a group of friends I keep in contact with over message, yet I'm too anxious to ever meet up. A lot of these friends are moving on in their lives, which I don't blame them for, considering our friendship never built up to it's potential because of my anxiety. The main people I talk to are my parents that I live with. This presents it's own issues as I don't feel I've ever found my identity. My brother and sister either formed long-term relationships or went travelling around the world at my age. Often your sense of being is built through experiences with friends of similar ages or trips you've been on. I feel I can't relate to my generation, as I have the mindset of an older person, considering my parents are not only my parents, but also my main social group. I have a cynical view on the world, generated by the shame I have for having IBS, which causes anxiety like a cycle. At school I was teased for having it, so now everyone I meet I think will laugh at me. I almost don't want to get to know people, because I don't want them to hurt me. I don't have many hobbies or interests, other than my job. I do solo activities like reading/jogging/podcasts. However, I don't find myself 'enjoying' them anymore, it's more something I do because I'm bored. I used to be quite passionate about my job, it's something I loved doing since I was a kid. If little me could see myself career wise he'd be ecstatic. 'You get to work on that?! Wow!!!!!!'. Yet if he saw my life outside of work, he'd be sad. Most days, I'll just surf the internet or reflect on how my anxiety is dictating my life, whilst seeing friends finding love, going partying or fulfilled in their interests. I've tried to address the anxiety, at the end of my school years I went to CBT sessions. Unfortunately the therapist wasn't for me. When I attended university, I decided to go privately to a councillor who I'm still seeing once a month after 2 years. I think they've helped quite a bit. I went from staying at the change-over station trying to find the courage to get on the next train, to picking up a hospitality job whilst at university. My motivation to succeed career-wise sometimes shifts my anxiety aside yet I find it very difficult to do the same in my social life. I thought exposure-therapy might help, yet I already had evidence of it not working i.e. I was still very anxious commuting to university even after doing it 3 times a week for 3 years. I think the anxiety probably reduced by 25%, but then plateaued. If there was any change in the situation, i.e. I go on the train with a friend rather than on my own, the anxiety then goes back up as if I'd never tried to tackle it. Whilst I like my therapist, I think I want to move on and find a CBT person who can set me goals and work through problems together. A councillor can be great, however I thought action might be better than talking. I'm sceptical given the experience I had of my previous CBT therapist though. I feel like there's so many problems to address. If I was anxious in one particular environment, I could see how it might be fixed. Yet my anxiety progresses into all aspects of my life. I was 9 when it started, it's going on 14 years since I first felt irrational anxiety. How do I address this? Do I force myself to go out more, and deal with the anxiety? Yet when I do, it only gets easier in that specific situation. Should I see a CBT therapist or is there another discipline that's better? What can they do that I haven't already? My hope is that, by writing this, someone might relate and see there's someone else like them. Or provide advice on what to do. Thanks all. "
se9jw1,"I need help.. I've been dealing with what is presumed to be social anxiety for the past 4-5 ish years and I pretty sure it stated because of how I was picked on in elementary school. Over the past 2 years it's gotten really bad, I haven't spoken to anyone in months, I haven't left the house in months and I just ultimately can't function properly unless I'm alone in my room. I find it hard to do simple things like taking the dog for a walk. And I always avoid going to stores, restaurants, parks etc to avoid people. I could go on but I think everyone here knows what social anxiety is. nnAnyways I've never told anyone and I've never been formally diagnosed... But at this point it's pretty obvious. I'm 16 almost 17 and I would really like to get the help I need, but I have no idea who/how to reach out to people. As I said before I have literally no friends and I don't feel confident enough to tell my family. I'd really like to know some ""first steps"" I could take in order to get help."

I don't know what to say anymore... How do u give advices, or just get someone to talk about what's wrong with them... I have social anxiety. I feel like I never got to learn to socialize properly.

mv9jqb,"how to escape?. hello I'm 13 years old, I have been diagnosed with mild depression and social anxiety. I have went to 5 or 4 different doctors in the course of a year now. and I've been taking all kinds of meds but nothing actually helps.  and#x200B; I don't go to school anymore, I only go for the tests (maybe because I used to get bullied). I haven't spoken to my ""friends"" in a very long time. I have a really hard time playing multiplayer video games. every time I try to speak to a random person I just say something that bothers them and they never talk to me again. I can't go outside on my own, I always panic when I get approached by a stranger. I used to have alot of panic attacks now every time I see one coming I try to leave the room.  and#x200B; there is something else that might be unrelated to all of this, it's talking to imaginary people (not outloud though).  and#x200B; how can I break this loop of painful events?"
eppqb6f,"Omg I was literally thinking of making a post about social anxiety and getting a job but I stumbled upon your post and we think too much alike. I have the same fear about getting a real job and moving out on my own. I just technically graduated from uni but I have one more class to complete. I’m thankful of living in a city with a lot of diverse opportunity and I was able to become a dog walker, and really it’s become my passion and the only thing I ever wanna do in terms of earning income. My mom thinks I’ll get a full-time corporate job when I’m officially done with all my college credits, but that’s not what I have in mind at all. I have this hopeful plan in the back of my head to keep being a dog walker for as long as I can and maybe try pick up some freelance work cuz lord knows that I refuse to work a 9-5 that involves toxic office co-workers and/or superficial happy hours. Ik relying on a part time job for my career path isn’t responsible at all but I’m honestly just improvising tf out of this whole adulting thing atm.  and I’m also the legit same when it comes to seeing a job I might be able to. Ever since my last semester ended few weeks ago, I been religiously looking on Indeed and other job sites and favoriting different jobs that are realistic enough for me but being afraid to apply cuz I think in my head what if I actually get the job/interview and can’t come through with it. Like I get all excited and motivated when I see a jobs requirements that looks doable but then I forget interviews always make me anxious like a bitch or feel that I won’t work well with co workers all thx to my SA... ugh"
ftkkby7," same thing happened to me, in my country we started going outside first week of may and since then it's became so hard to look at people while walking I feel like everyone is judging me, but I'm working on it and after a few weeks it's not that bad "

p5z56x,"My Friends Outwardly Expressed Their Embarrassment of Me and Now I Don’t Know What to Do. tw// self harm I have diagnosed social anxiety and my worst fears are concocted inside the depths of my anxiety. Those include the way my friends think of me because I’ve grown up surrounded by people who have constantly torn me down emotionally. This brings me to what I’m nervous about. So surprisingly, I am a theatre student and I adore theatre, music, and acting. During a production I was in with a large group of close friends with a company I have a deep connection to, me and two other campers (it’s a theatre camp) began practicing harmonies for both our show and for fun. I only participated a few times and not for very long (10 minutes at the longest). It was fun and the two kids I was doing it with were pretty talented and could hold their pitch so it sounded really good. The problem was, we were doing this in a pretty open place that had a few other people doing makeup, talking, and preparing for the shows. It didn’t sound bad and at the time I didn’t think it was embarrassing because no one was telling us to stop and no one was saying anything (we actually got some complements). I understand that maybe we shouldn’t have been close to others and could’ve taken our space but I didn’t understand until after that people thought we were embarrassing. My two close friends told me a couple days ago on FaceTime that they could not stand it and that they were so embarrassed. I immediately began thinking back through everything and replaying who heard us and tried to figure out if anyone tried to tell me to stop. Now I literally feel like I ruined my last year in that camp and my chances of being a counselor because my friends thought I was annoying. I haven’t felt that awful in a long time and I ended up self harming for the first time in a while. It may not seem like a big deal or enough to do that over but it was to me."
ejmczdf," Honestly it depends on the person, if the other person thinks you are good friends then they might be a little upset you didn't mention it before, and I feel like that's only if they ever asked you directly and you didn't tell them. If their just you work colleague/acquaintance they shouldn't think much of it. When I've told friends and acquaintances that I'm going on a holiday for two weeks (I've been on cruises to New Zealand, and Fiji, and have been to Japan once and the Philippines a few times etc.) They're initially response is just being a little surprised, saying that's awesome. I usually just say I'm going with my family, or I have family over there (and they are like ah okay). Not once a friend has asked me how do you afford this? Money is a touchy subject for most. If they ask, just say you're good at saving? Unless you brag about how rich you are, people won't tend to judge negatively. If anything they'd just be a little jealous that you're going to the U.S I've had really good friends that I haven't told specific things about my family and when I've told them, they are usually surprised, it has never wrecked my relationship with them or changed anything. I just say I'm a mysterious gal and play it off as a joke lol. These are just my experiences, I can't really predict how someone will react because everyone is different. "
dktbwz8,"I have felt exactly the same when looking to buy clothes. In my opinion it is all based on confidence at the time.nnI believe my confidence fluctuates rapidly everyday, but my base level is that of social anxiety. So what I do is, if there is some shopping I need to do, I will do something first that will improve my confidence i.e. listen to some music and go for a walk. I find the fact i'm around people uneasy but the music calms me so overall I feel more confident. nnNot sure if any of that was helpful, but in my case I need something to boost my confidence before hand so i'm not constantly thinking about whether people are looking at me while i'm shopping."
njiosz,"i just want to be able to do normal things. i’m 16 and haven’t had a job yet. I have nothing to do over the summer at all (no friends, no motivation to go outside, etc.) there’s a dunkin’ donuts like a 5 minute walk away from me and my parents feel like it would be a good thing for me to work there. I also feel like it might help me and give me something to do but it just seems so unrealistic and impossible. I honestly don’t even know how to have social interactions anymore and thinking of messing stuff up, memorizing things, and having to talk to people makes me so anxious even thinking about it. On one hand I should face my fears and go out into the world and do something, but on the other hand the fear and possible judgement is just too much for me to handle. I know i’ll never get anywhere if I don’t push myself though. Sorry for rambling but what are your experiences with working with social anxiety? What do you think I should do? 🥴"
fqsjxia, See if there are any decent hiking trails in your area. Walking in nature means guaranteed little to no people and is better than exercising in the city.

t5djpa,"He hates me. My aunt invited me on a trip this upcoming summer. A bunch of her friends are going as well. I’m 25f  and all of her friends are late 50’s. I met one of my aunts friends named frank. Frank is married to Julie. Frank and I hit it off one night (totally friendly, he’s literally my fathers age). Frank added me on Facebook which I thought nothing of. Julie and frank were in town one week with my aunt. Julie referred to me as fat in front of a bunch of people  and frank gave me the cold shoulder. He literally hid in his room whenever I went over and if I sat down near him he would leave. My aunt told me that one night frank got drunk and started a fight with her about the pictures I post on Facebook. I live in a beach town so posting pictures with my twin sister on the beach I didn’t think was a big deal. He said I was provocative and didn’t understand me (said nothing about my twin sister who he has met numerous times and is friends w/ on fb as well, she posts bathing suit pictures as well). Frank deleted me off Facebook. Julie and frank are going on this trip. I feel like frank and Julie hate me for no reason. It’s literally a once in a lifetime trip but I’m so nervous about seeing them. Any tips on how to handle this?"

frgz8u5," You know, back in highschool I used to play soccer and basketball with a couple of friends during lunch just for fun. The thing is that I was always so freaking bad at it. Like every sport I was just terrible at and I had no idea why. I would even practice at home and improve but once I got to playing with friends it's like none of it mattered. I now realized that it was probably because of my anxiety. I remember every time I had the ball I just couldn't function properly and I just wanted to get rid of it and pass it to someone else because if I had the ball then I would be the center of attention and I just couldn't do that. I don't know why I didn't realized this back then and that it wasn't my fault that I was so bad. For some reason I just can't function normally when eyes are on me. There's times when I'm doing something and as soon as someone walks in and starts watching me, my brain just completely stops focusing on what I'm doing and starts thinking about what that person is thinking of me. And it's usually bad things. I've improved a lot with my social anxiety but that is still something that I just can't get through and I don't know how to fix it. Also I just can't talk on the phone while other people are around because I feel like they're listening and will judge me for what I'm talking about. "

But because she works during the day I only really see her for a few hours in the evening after she finishes work. From like 5pm to 10pm when she goes to bed. Seeing my sister in the evenings, and occasionally her boyfriend when he comes over. And going to the grocery store etc. Is pretty much the only socialising I do during the week and I am starting to feel pretty fed up and lonely. For the last two days she’s been around at his house and I’ve pretty much just been cooped up in the house making music. I could go out the house for a walk or something but that’s just not fun to me. I was meant to be going to a party tonight but part of me bailed because I have no money as I’m too anxious to work and part of me bailed because I’m having an anxious week and can’t face partying. I feel like this cycle will never end. This self sabotage of keeping myself at home to shelter myself from the outside world. I get graded exposure works but I’ve been trying with graded exposure for the last almost 4 years! And it’s such a slow process. I’m currently along sitting in bed and feeling bored and helpless. Please help with advise! Thanks"
agqze9," Talked to a Someone for the First Time in a Year (or so), Now Feeling More Depressed than I have in a While.. (First post, sorry in advanced for formatting) Some background: I (23M) had been commuting to Community College for about 3 years now, and just now started my first semester at a university as a junior. I started this past Tuesday but had been sick through the beginning of the week as well as sleep-deprived (mostly due to anxiety but also sickness). Anyways, today I meet this girl due to circumstance and we start walking around campus and talking. After talking for a bit I learned she graduated high school pretty young and was already a senior (from what a gathered this girl was only 19, maybe 20); and of course on top of that, I found her attractive, so already I'm already struggling to hold conversation because I just find her amazing. We keep talking and she doesn't seem too bothered by me, (we ended getting lunch together and talking for another hour before she had to leave for class). Just as a side-note this is the third girl I have talked to in college and the other two were almost exactly like this girl; they had all been through pretty traumatic shit in their past, this girl had lost her boyfriend (I didn't ask how, as to not be rude) and her mother was diagnosed with cancer. So, I just had this immense respect for her as I had for these other two women on top of everything else mentioned earlier. &amp;#x200B; So I end up exchanging numbers with this girl which is where my already growing anxiety just goes ballistic. I make one shitty joke, begin to think about how poorly it went with the other two girls, start thinking about how awkward I must have been at lunch; since I was sick and sleep deprived I wasn't exactly sharp, on top of the way I had almost immediately felt about this girl. Just, shit starts piling up which in turn starts making me feel more depressed and anxious than normal ; and when I get back from school I get home and my body aching, I have a headache and I can't stop thinking about this girl. I keep thinking what's wrong with me for being here again; and, even if it were possible, do I need a friend or something more (I had just recently lost my best friend of 20 years and had been feeling more lonely than ever this past year), so I'm just currently a mess; I honestly just don't want to mess this up and be friends with this girl but can't help feel like I did something wrong or said something really stupid (we've stopped texting each other so I'm probably reading into that too much as well), but I'm really unsure what to do. Feeling like shit, and just looking for some advice on how to deal with this anxiety and the condition I'm in. &amp;#x200B; Sorry for the long read and thank you for your time/advice. "
5lkn13,"I'm afraid of little fucking kids. Well maybe afraid isn't the *best* word, but it's not far off. I'm not worried they can physically harm me or anything, nor do I even hate kids, most kids I actually like, but certain kids, like uncle's girlfriend's one kids, make me uncomfortable and make my anxiety go off badly. He's like 6 or something like that, but he is disrespectful to me, and harasses me when I'm around. He'll make smart ass remarks which although typical small child insults, get to me, not because they hurt my feelings so much, but it gets to me that I'm so pathetic, I can't even demand respect from a fucking child. Today, playing some backyard cricket with my brother and other cousin (a very respectful kid who I love), he asks if he can peg the ball at my groin, to which I obviously say no, so what does he do? he throws it lightly there at me, to which I'm so fucking pathetic, I can't even yell at him. I can't yell at anyone really, but I always tell myself that I'll fix that later, but to be uncomfortable around a kid. He even makes me uncomfortable when he's around other people I care about. My mum cooked my brother a pizza for lunch, when he, and another cousin younger than him came up and started harrasing him for a piece. Even my mum was getting the shits, and she doesn't give a shit about what anyone thinks. I just had to get it all off my chest, I'm probably the most pathetic person on reddit, but has anyone else had anything at all similar to this?"

I had never had an actual romantic experience (I’m really shy) and I had absolutely no social skills, I was really anxious. it was like 2-3 a.m. and we went for a walk and talked a bit, he called me beautiful a few times and then he kissed me and had to leave (he left the resort, went home). I’ll never see him again but it was a nice awkward (for me) first kiss."
p60q78,Do I have social anxiety ?. I’ve felt like I’ve had social anxiety for a few years now but I haven’t done anything about it infact I might not even have it. I am 13 years old and I am always nervous to go outside to public places I feel like everyone is staring at me and I’m even nervous to go out with friends. Another reason I think I have it is because when I’m talking to someone I find it uncomfortable to make eye contact I also feel like everyone is against me. Do all of these reasons suggest I have social anxiety or am I just a wierd person?
hfm7949, That is true! It also means I'm staying in the room all day haha Although I have already been out in town and went in the pool too 
g45x0j6," i was gonna say go outside, ya you’re probably gonna be like nope, cause that’s how i am. once i do something that i didn’t wanna do, i feel ten times better. cmon just sit outside for a half hour, go for a walk once you got yourself outside, be active, stay positive! didn’t necessarily read thoroughly, but do whatever you think is gonna make you feel best, say fuck it, not negatives that come from doing productive positive things "
mhxuaa, What's the most embarassing thing you struggle with?. For me it's when I stand outside and a car drives up to me. I get so anxious. 
fv4945z," I am going to be a freshman in college this fall and I was in your shoes. I have social anxiety as well and just got diagnosed my senior year. I loved soccer and played my whole life and I also started doing track Freshman year of high school, but because my social anxiety kept getting worse, I couldn’t even play those sports my senior year. Why? Because of allll those damn worries in my head. There’s no way I could’ve talked and dated a boy in high school either. I have a fear I’ll be to awkward, boring, you name it. Now, I hear you, and have no idea what your situation or relationship to your family is. But please tell someone about what you’re going through. For me, I started by telling my older brother, and he helped me build up the courage to ask my mom to get help. And we did. But if you truly want to get better, you have to build up the courage to just let it all out to someone who can help you. It might not be that easy for you to get help, but I’m actually asking you to Please get help for yourself. Why live life in fear and worries when you have an opportunity to overcome it? Anxiety is a bully. But here’s how I got better, and still getting better. And hopefully you can kick anxiety in the ass like me and SO many other successful people with social anxiety. When I told my mom, she was reluctant at first. She honestly kept trying to make excuses to deny that it might just be shyness, and honestly I just said, “just please take me” for like the 50th time I’m not sure😂And finally my mom took me to the doctor. When the doctor asked me questions, I let it ALL out to the point where I teared up. And you know what, it felt like the best thing in the world. I was finally going to start kicking anxiety’s ass. And I was SO NERVOUS before my appointment and worried about everything. But it was all in my head and the appointment goes very well and it’s sooo easy. They are trained to make you feel comfortable. After the appointment was done, I was prescribed Prozac. And I started with a baby dose of 10 mg. For some reason I was extremely scared to take any sort of pill for my social anxiety, because... Yeah all those worries you probably get me😂. Anyway, when I started taking the pill, no side effects even happened at all like I worried about. And right now I’m taking a 40 mg and still no side effects. :) I’m also doing exposure therapy, which sounds tiring and uncomfortable, but WORTH IT... I told myself if you wanna kick anxiety’s ass, you gotta suck it up and just do it. Moral of the story is try to hype yourself up if you start to get nervous😂 Sorry for this VERY long ramble, but I wanted to tell you some of the things that I’ve overcome because I got help. 1. I was able to actually email and call a grocery store to get a job. I was so nervous, but none of the things I was worried about even happened. 2. I’m actually texting with a guy I like. Who would’ve thought?? I would have never been able to do that before and it’s all your anxiety that makes you think your worthless at anything. 3. I can finally start more conversations when I’m at the dinner table and sound more confident. Overall, it’s HUGE what getting help can do for you. That’s why it’s there, so people like you and me don’t have to deal with the bully of social anxiety. And the first step to kicking anxiety in the ass, is to tell someone. Just do it... hype yourself up, ignore those anxious thoughts, and just let it all out to your mom. It will be SOOO 100% worth it in the end. I promise. And if you ever need to talk, ask questions, etc. you can ALWAYS message me whenever, and I’ll be more than happy to help you. :) You got this!! I truly believe in you. (Also, thanks for taking time out of your day to read this gigantic ramble of mine) "

e1sjtdq,"Thank you for that wholesome and long advice! I didn't see it immediately because I said ""fuck it"" and watered the garden no matter what.

The fact that I wasn't aware of my neighbours helped me a lot. nnThank you for your tips, they really encourage me to get out there more! Hopefully they'll work in the future.

mtknre," Family Reunion in 2 weeks... and I'm terrified.. (M/20) 𝗦𝗼𝗼𝗼 this is my first post here, sorry if it's extra long, don't really know what I'd be getting by posting this but I just needed somewhere to express myself since everyone here seems super chill. Not sure where to start besides the fact that anxiety has risen 1000% ever since I was informed that we'll be going to an outdoor birthday party for one of the elders of our family (everyone's coming together so basically a reunion.) Which would be great... if I didn't feel like an outsider in my own family. For some backstory, my life's become a POS. I was an only child raised by a single Mom, but I grew up in a lower income duplex with a couple of friends and I guess could be considered ""popular"" in Elementary School (ain't like popularity is much of a high bar in that stage of life.) Those were the g days. But it all changed when we 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 hit financial hardships in middle school. After getting evicted, becoming homeless and couch surfing, I lost confidence in every aspect of my life. I'd never really grew up around much of my family, just my grandparents I was close to who unfortunately passed away when I was young. Although I had decent relationships cousins and such during childhood, when I got older I'd only be around for the traditional holdiays, so I never really got to know them like how I should. And of course my family is very loud and outspoken, interested in things I'm not and don't really know how to relate to quiet people. Which isn't their fault but they all have the personalities of a highschool clique or ""the"" lunch table. And if your personality doesn't match it's like, you're not one of them. They sort of talk down to you since you're quiet instead of an equal. All of this combined doesn't mesh well at the family cookout. Every time I go to one I'm extremely uncomfortable, it's like everyone around me has a degree in small talk and I missed the course. I immediately shut down even though I want to be outspoken, but I literally have nothing to say. I just sit there in agony wishing I could either socialize better or just run away. It's like I'm trying to fulfill an expectation they have of me, and never achieving it makes me hate myself for it. I look around and everyone's laughing, smiling, talking, and then there's me, sitting there like a loser... Feeling alone in the presence of family. I love them, but from a distance. What's worse is that I feel like I can't do anything about it. As if I will always be this way, unable to connect to people in a deeper way than just surface level hi and byes. I don't know what to do, I can't avoid it, but it's extremely unhealthy for my mental health. I've tried to tell my mom about it and of course I wasn't understood. Young Christian black men that's a son of hers couldn't possibly have social anxiety. ""Just go out. Socialize, I'm not the one holding you back."" If only it was that easy. I have so, so much more to say but I'll keep it at that for now. I may give an update to let you guys know how it went. If you made it this far, damn. Thanks for giving my rant attention lol. Any feedback would be much appreciated "
rt57le,"Tips for overcoming resentment toward others so I can make friends. I began homeschooling at age 13 and have not had friends since. I just turned 20 and am in my first year of community college (I took a gap year) and there’s few opportunities for interaction at my school. I’ve had a boyfriend for the past 9 months, and every time I would be in a group situation with his friends or family I would be extremely socially anxious and unable to know what to say, when to speak, and often times what the point of the interaction was at all. I understand how it could be fun for people who know how to interact and for people who are already good friends with each other to do things in groups and go to parties together, but due to being rejected so much socially I have developed this “What? I don’t even get the point of those types of ‘shallow’ interactions” type of mindset. Like “oh so I’m not cool enough to do that, so that thing isn’t even cool to me anymore anyway so whatever” lol type of mindset. I genuinely do not know how to navigate group interactions or even one on one platonic interactions and despite actively working on it still harbor so much envy toward those who do. My boyfriend and my therapist have both described me as being very personable when they each first met me as I was raised to be very polite. I also went on this group backpacking trip program last summer and I remember certain people being very shocked after being around me for a week or so to hear that I hadn’t spoken with pretty much anyone other than my parents for like 6+ years. But I still developed zero bond with any of these people in my age range with whom I had a lot in common and was in the middle of the wilderness doing challenging things with every day for a month. Sleeping near them, eating with them, doing memorable things like climbing mountains with them, but I made no real connections bc I was too afraid to talk in group interactions. I know I am very naïve and rely on self deprecating humor and just giggle too much in general out of nervousness, and so people begin to treat me like I’m stupid or immature and I don’t like that feeling. I think that’s a bit narcissistic bc I just want to be seen in a positive light… I want to be normal if not “cool” haha. About a month and a half into dating each other my bf was like “oh by the way I tell everyone you’re my gf” and that was exactly what I wanted to hear, but despite that I still hated saying that I had a bf and would say the word “boyfriend” with gritted teeth for like a month after that. Bc I had had so much resentment toward girls who were pretty and liked by boys and all around “good enough” to have boyfriends bc I felt I wasn’t for so long and then developed an “ew romantic relationships are gross nobody likes me and I’ve developed this weird pride and attachment to that identity” thing as I still have about platonic relationships. Due to always fucking up in social situations and often times apparently doing a horrible job despite thinking I was following all the rules and doing okay, I have become very confused about the whole thing and extremely self conscious. I don’t know who I should be and what I’m allowed to do basically, and am probably narcissistically hyper-vigilant and concerned with what others think of me. Every day, and sometimes subconsciously, I’m observing others and trying to learn how to act and who to be to avoid rejection. I am constantly trying to figure people out so to speak and feel ridiculously, illogically different from others. Thanks for reading. Any similar experiences or tips greatly appreciated 🙏🏻"
i6etu6,Went outside and buy some ice cream. Wow I feel so anxious and awkward..I still remember when I was a child that I would not have trouble buying ice cream..What happened to me?Anyone else dont know why they've become socially anxious?Man Im 18 How do I fix this social anxiety ?
d055vwy," I can definitely relate. I used to be an outgoing extrovert. I was the life of a party, never nervous, enjoyed socializing. I loved being around people, talking to people, going outside and to events. Now I can't even leave my house to go grocery shopping, I'm pretty much an introvert, and it's only getting worse. "
dpdt51d,"Haha I love this story. You're a good writer . Reading it made me feel really anxious . I had a similar experience recently where I told a girl I had a crush on that I liked her, and she said, aww that's sweet. And yes like you said I just felt so relieved to be released from that suspense and glad because I'm not in a place to date anyone right now. I'm working on myself and in particular trying to discover new hobbies. The only hobby I really enjoyed was outdoor stuff like hiking and biking but it's getting too cold and rainy for that. So now I'm just bored and don't know what to do with myself on weekends. :("
e9g0aj6," I used to work in a pizza place and I felt the exact same at first. Especially answering the phones and having to ring up customers in person. I was terrified of it, but trust me once you get the hang of the system you'll be able to place orders super easily and answering the phone becomes a breeze. It's just your first week and you were kind of thrown into it so it feels really overwhelming, and it is, but once you get the hang of how the place works it will become much much easier. Fuck training videos by the way, they don't do shit. Stop being lazy and teach me how to do it yourself. Also, you'll deal with so many dumbass customers in the pizza business that you'll soon learn that a lot of the time someone yells at you for a mess up or something like that, its their fault and they're just taking it out on you. People are assholes. But seriously, it will become a lot easier and less stressful in a week or two. Just have to get used to how the place works. "
emwrxg,"I want to go to music festivals this summer, but I have no one to go with.. I (24f) used to go to concerts all the time in middle school/beginning of high school. I had one specific concert friend. We went to small shows pretty much every weekend and bigger shows whenever they were in town, until she moved away. And then I literally stopped seeing live music. I missed so many huge concerts I would have loved to go to because I was scared of going by myself. For the past few years I’ve been longing to get into the festival scene, but I feel scared of going alone. Honestly, it’s mostly about the logistics of camping, or finding my way to and from the festival, even getting to the city where the festival is that scares me. Once I’m in the crowd, dancing around I’ll provably be fine. Idk it’s depressing. My sister (21) is very popular and social. She has a core group of friends and then seriously hundreds of acquaintances. She already has tickets to Electric Forest and Bonnaroo this summer, as well as a big group to camp with. I’ve never been this jealous in my life. I signed up for the ambassador program for Bonnaroo to try and earn a free ticket, but I know it’s pointless because I don’t have any friends who would buy them through me. It’s just depressing. Social anxiety has affected every part of my life since I was 12 years old. Even in really mundane ways. But I feel like I can’t even go out and do fun things. I just have to go to work and then come and be alone every day for the rest of my life."
r3pju9,"Need friends that understand. Hi! I need more friends and preferably friends that understand my social anxiety. I’d prefer to use snap but am flexible. I’m a SAHM, I’m 22(f), I LOVE reading, dogs and hiking. We don’t have to have the same interests though. Be my friend 😁🥺"
fh508ul, next time i will suggest going to the cinema cuz for me being in a cinema is a lot easier than being outside 
esnd383, Please my man DO NOT rush things!!!!!!!!!!!! I have messed up with every single girl that’s ever given me a chance because of this. Maybe take her to a bar or something next time and use the alcohol to keep the awkwardness at bay. I really hope this can be a success for you!!!! 😃👌 You got this 
djcezf8," Yeah because everyone else has insecurities too. And some believe that you dont talk to them because you're ""too full of yourself"" and ""cant be bothered to talk to them"". Its takes me a long time to build a comfort level with someone and when i finally do open up with someone, they usually say that they thought i was a ""stuck up asshole"" but now they realize they were wrong. Yeah im 18 and im actively trying to work on this problem and be outside more. Growing up, i wasnt an ""outdoors type"" and didnt hang out at all, like the other kids did. But now i really do want to be more good at being social. Im not an introvert and being with people actually makes me really happy. Thats why it hurts so much when you cant connect with them like you want to. Its like being in a glass cage. I do believe I'll get better at it with time. Thanks for being so kind, fellow Redditor. "
co74f3," Overcame social anxiety (some advice needed). I am 25 years old and in my youth i had always suffered from social anxiety. I have very low self-esteem, had self-hate and was always worried what other people thought about me. In my youth i was bullied and that had an effect on me. Because of the social anxiety, i avoided going to restaurants, cinema, swimming pool etc. I almost stayed home and felt very lonely. I was addicted to porn and sex (prostitutes, swingerclubs, sexparties) to numb my feelings of emptiness, loneliness, depression, anxiety, low self-esteem. In march 2017 i went in therapy for the addiction and for my social anxiety. Since then i have been working hard on myself, making small steps every day to grow as a person. Stopping with porn and masturbation helped me a lot. In the subreddit NoFap, people also say that by stopping with watching porn, their confidence level went up and the social anxiety disappeared. I also read a lot of articles NoFap, what have inspired me a lot and helped me a lot. In therapy I revealed all my shame to a safe group and i felt relieved of the shame. I don't have a therapy group anymore and still making small steps. I also was a Nice Guy and always tried to fix other people's problems, was afraid to say No to somebody, didn't set boundaries and was always nice. I kept all my anger in me. This was all because of low self-esteem. I read the book No More Mr. Nice Guy and did the practices, that helped me a lot. I also joined the reddit NMMNG, what also inspired me. I don't have social anxiety anymore, can go to swimming pools, restaurants, cinema's and going everywhere without having a panic attack or deep fear what people think of me. If i walk down the street, i walk tall and with a straight back. I can now take my space and don't make myself small anymore. I am thankful for that improvement. **What have helped me:** * Going in therapy * revealing all my shame to safe group / safe people * making small steps, doing small things what i am afraid of * listening to positive affirmations (found on YouTube) * meditating daily for 5 minutes, to calm my mind * exercising * reading a lot of self-help and personal development books * Stopped with caffeine after reading the book: Caffeine Blues. * Caffeine made me very anxious and I got panic attacks. * I stopped for 6 months now and saw a huge improvement in lower anxiety levels. * In that book the link between caffeine and anxiety is explained. But there are a few things that i still need and want to work on. **What i want:** * Strike up conversation with new people. I want to learn more people, able to make friends and to be very social. * I don't have so many friends and still am afraid to strike up conversations with new people * by meeting new people, i am still shy. I takes a long time before i show my real self to them or feel comfortable around new people and new situations * Want to be able to approach women * Had never a date or approached women, because in my youth i was twice rejected and after that i became afraid * I see so many beautiful women that i want to know and to date, but the fear keeps me stuck * want to go on dates &amp;#x200B; Anyone that have some suggestions/tips on how i can achieve that and what have worked for them? If you suffered from social anxiety and have overcome it, also please leave a comment. I like to learn from others and to be inspired by others. "
dlhvecv,"i would use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for mental health stuff. i have a habit of meditating, doing ACT exercises (soon CBT exercises as well), reading self help books, journaling and jogging on a daily basis.nnbut i feel a lot of resistance to doing the in field stuff, so i'll probably purchase an online social anxiety CBT program like this one https://socialanxietyinstitute.org/social-anxiety-treatment/online-therapy/overcoming-social-anxiety and collaborate with my therapist to work it through. "
fsys8om," No thanks, it's too anxiety-y outside and I have too much inside left to live for. "
659kl2," Im scared to see Girls. Hello all . Im male 27years old. Hope its ok post this here . As title says... Im scared to see girls who have potential to kiss/have sex with me. The ''probem'' is, Im good looking and tall. Isn't rare: girls are flirting with me, but this stop since I stop going out, 4-5 years ago . Literally, last years I never ever go to a party or house party or just a bar with friends because Im worried that I might see a girl . Off course Im proud that girls are interessed in me, but my social anixiety with girls are so high, that makes me feel ''bad'', very nervous, and I mean, really really nervous. Its not fun, I can't enjoy when this happens . This happens since Im a kid. My heart goes fast, Im became nervous, start sweating... its ridiculous ! I lost my virginity at 16 with a prostitute. I was very horny and wanted to ''test'' before try, I thought this would make me feel more confortable around girls. It was very good, I enjoy a lot, but didn't work as a ''test'', I still very scared to see girls. I kissed only ~20 girls in my life, and all of them ask me out and/or friends made everything for me. I never ever aproach a girl... its so hard for me. Only 1 girl from this 20 were from my social circle, and we just kissed because she was a bit agressive haha. (Im glad she was, otherwise nothing would happen). And there was many many times when it was obvious a hot girl was interessed in me, she even said that, but if I have to make the ''last move'', I just don't do it !!!! There was hot girls in school flirting with me. Talking with beautiful girls from my social circle is ... impossible ! Some very hot girls invited me to party, or was flirting ''heavy'', staring me, saying I was handsome, the most handsome she ever saw etc. I never go because I was ''busy''... actually, I was very scared to do wrong things. One girl even wrote a letter inviting me to go to movie teather. With all this hapenning, its obvious that most people in my social circle thinks Im gay. I don't care the fact they think that, and actually they also don't care, but its curious that I love girls and even my family and best friends think Im gay. I think my best friend knows Im not gay, he knows Im weird, he doesn't knows what happens in my mind, but he knows I see prostitutes. whatever, not important, just to you see how pathetic I am: not the fact people thikn Im gay, the fact that I love girls and because I never move, they think Im gay. As I said, I stop going out years ago. Literally, I just stay at home. Because my ridiculous social anxiety, I lost many chances in life, jobs etc, meeting new people and also lost my old good friends. The happiest day of my life was years ago, the 1st time I had sex with a normal girl (not prostitute). Happenned when I was traveling alone, I went at night club with a goal to ask out 3 girls, doesn't matter results, just do it! I didn't ask any girl (doh, scared idiot!), I was drinking at bar and a girl asked me if I want drink with her and her friend and before I could answer she literally put her back/ass on my lap and put my hands to touch her boobs. We kissed during an hour or 2 at night club and later she invited me to her place - I wouldn't ask that - and we had sex. I remember walking inside her house holding her hands, going upstairs, all I could think was ''I don't believe Im doing this. thanks god Im drunk, Id run forever to hide if I was sober''. Sex was fine, she want more more. She asked me to sleep there, I slept and we had sex in the morning. This morning was the best moment of my life. It was akward, but I didn't had a heart atack and didn't die. When she told me she was at a university, I had a mini-panick atack, thinking about she telling everyone... idk what Im scared, my dick is fine (above average in girth and lenght), probably Im terrible at sex because not much experience, but I don't mind if she says to her friends ''xxx is terrible at sex''. I asked myself million of times, WHY Im scared, whats the problem if Im rejected, what happens ? nothing, I still alone, like Im at this moment. And what happens if they like me ? will be awesome!!!!! Im sure only good things can happen if I put myself out there, especially with my lucky genetics, but still, I don't have balls to go . Only good things can happen, not bad things can happen, WHY I DON'T DO IT !?!?!?! I think its because Im scared they notice I don't have experience, its the excuse I say since Im 16... lol. The only 2 times I had sex with normal girls (not prostitutes) were when I was traveling and I was sure they weren't in my social circles. The 2nd was more or less like the 1st, but she wasn't agressive, no hands on boobs or something like that. One of them called me back - the 2nd -, but I didn't answer because I didn't know what do, them she sent me a rude message saying that she was disapointed because she like me and all she wanted to say was invite me to a party... the other didn't call me. And off course, being scared like I am, I didn't call any of them. Another example of how scared I am: Im with friends at bar, but in a moment Im alone, 2 beautiful girls came and say ''hi, you looks exatcly like my ex'' and the other ''yes, you are handsome''. bla bla bla, Im very nervous, but they are still there, they noticed I was ''slow'' and one of them said ''which one you choose ? me or her ? '' I just freeze, didn't know what do, they noticed I was the biggest loser in this world and leave. If they just kiss me, would be fine, and after the 1st kiss, I relax and can act like a human being. Another history: my male friend ask if I want play pool and drink beer. While we were there, friend meet 3 girls from his university, one of them was very interessed in me, it was obvious, I was a bit drunk, tried to say something, but was ridiculous, her friend said, making a joke about me ''someone need seduction lesson''. We leaving, waiting our cars in the park, and that girl came and kiss me without say anything, just like a movie, a big kiss ! NICE ! Stuff like that, or close to that, happenned other times too. Im not going to tell all of them because the post is already too long. Im pathetic loser. If I was scared because I was ugly, small dick, or if I had any feature that most woman don't like, I guess Id think ''well, it makes sense you being scared''. But Im all good...and still Im the most scared guy living in this planet! I had sex with 50 or 60 prostitutes. Because they have something to hide (the fact she is a prostitute) makes me more confident, because I won't be rejected ($$$), and she won't tell anything about me to anyone . Because IF she knows someone who I know, she will be scared to me hear and tell ''lol, she is a hooker !!!"" so I feel safe meeting prostitutes. I never went on a date. All girls I kissed was at party, house party etc. This 2 girls I had sex (not prostitutes), both were from another country while I was traveling. Look how scared I am, never have sex with a girl in my country , and Im going to be 30 in 3 years !!!!! Sorry for this long text... I want to vent. if you have any advice, please tell me. just don't say ''just go for it, you have everything in your side'', because I already know , and I still don't go :( . Its irrational fear !!! When I think about it, being rational, I almost go, but its irrational !!! I know Im fine, but I can't go !. Any other guy or girl had a similar problem like this with oposite sex (or with the same sex if you are gay) ? How to conquer this ? ps: I re-read my post before send. Im not humble-braging saying Im good looking and girls ask me out, its just to show you that my fear is level 1million . "
42eqjz,"I'm pathetic. I'm 19 and a senior in high school. I have a couple ""friends"" but they can never hang out. I haven't gone ""out"" since middle school because nobody wants to be with me cause I'm ""weird"". There's people I talk to in school but I recently noticed more than before how they belittle me. They always take snapchats of me and send them around to other people. They all just talk down on me and see how I react though I usually just laugh it off. I know I'm no social butterfly but I never saw myself as the ""weird"" kid everyone sees me as. I remember someone tweeted a picture of me (some kid in gym class showed me it) and it said ""when your sitting next to a school shooter"" and another kid was making a weird scared type face. It got a bunch of retweets and everything. I cried myself to sleep that night. I have an Instagram although I want to delete cause nobody cares about me. And getting it only makes things worse! I see all these posts of parties and people drinking, smoking weed and I know I'll never be a part of that fun. And the worst part is seeing all hot girls and knowing what they think of me, the ""weird kid"". I mean look at me, 19 and never smoked, drank, partied, had sex or touched a girl at all for that matter I can't take it anymore. Nobody shows me any respect and when I try to stick up for myself they just laugh. I'm just the joke kid everybody sends snapchats to eachother of and laugh about it. The closets I got to a real, somewhat cool friend in highschool was sophomore year with this kid I knew from middle school. He was at my house doing a project and he got a text invite to a bonfire. He said I should come along. I was so happy for the first time in a long time and I was getting ready in the bathroom all happy and he was talking to 2 of the girls on speaker in my living room and I heard them say ""ewww wtf don't bring that kid"". He laughed and when I walked out he said it was cancelled and he had to go. There was a picture of them all on Instagram later that night. Idk what the point of this is and sorry it's so long but I just needed a place to vent. It actually helps a little."

fvdoc70," The first one was when me and my friend was at the beach and we decided to bike to the city to buy food. We discussed if we should put on pants or just wear shorts and some random guy came up to us and yelled at us for being irresponsible and how disappointed our parents must be in us. Over if we would wear shorts while biking, wtf?? The second time was another time me and my friends were at the beach and some dude had decided to put up a tent in the middle of the beach. I had my dog with me who loves swimming, and the beach was very small, probably like 4 meters long and obviously we had to go out of the water right beside him, because he was in the middle of the fuckkng beach?? He started yelling st me that I cant walk there and my stupid dog ruins his things and I need to get my dog under control. I had him on a leash and he was walking calmly right beside me. The third time this week was today, I was outside with my dog because we were going to get the mail. I live on a farm with very few people around and since its literally 20 seconds of walking I didn’t put him on a leash. We met an old man with a dog and my dog ran after them and when I went to get him he started telling me how irresponsible I am and I need to use my brain and this is exactly why kids shouldn’t own dogs (i’m 17). I’m aware that the situation was my fault but people doesn’t have to be so rude?! I’m trying, but one of my biggest fears is getting yelled at, because of my social anxiety but also because it triggers flashbacks. Its happening all the time lately and I’m terrified of leaving my house if people are going to tell at me all the time!!:(( "
nqve3r,"I'm sick of having anxiety and I'm sick of being held back by it. I've decided to try and better myself recently. I've quit smoking and started jogging which is going well. I decided today to go to the gym to do weight training. The moment I woke up I knew I didn't want to go. I got in the car and drove to the gym. Sat in my car for ten minutes trying to force myself to go in. I get out of the car and walk to the front door, fight or flight kicks in and I just turn right the fuck around and drive home. Feel angry at myself the whole day. I decide to go back this evening, actually make it inside. But I freeze in the changing rooms, sit there for 10 mins fucking bricking it. Force myself out of the changing rooms and can't even bring myself to even approach the weight area. Give up, drive home, lie and my bed and cry. I'm sick of holding myself back coz of crippling anxiety. This isn't normal behaviour for 25 year old bloke, there's somthing wrong with me. I can't talk to people properly, I can't enjoy packed bars or nights out. I can't talk to women. I can't focus on my job properly. Fuck this shit"
dd3wvwa, Yeah I know the feeling all to well (feels like I'm floating though a river of White noise). In my case I think my depression and social anxiety feed into one another to create the perfect storm shittiness. 
mg2xib,"⚠️Severe ⚠️ Social Anxiety Need Help plz. I’m 20 years old and have had social anxiety all my life. It wasn’t so bad when I was younger,but by the time I got to high school I couldn’t even look people in the eye. At one point during my sophomore year I was straight up agoraphobic and couldn’t go outside or i’d sweat bullets. Nowadays it isn’t so bad but it’s actually gotten worse in some ways. I’m able to go outside and talk to people but I just always have this feeling in the back of my mind that these people think i’m a loser, they think i’m ugly, or they think I walk weird, you know the usual social anxiety stuff. The thing is, I get these thoughts in my head mid conversation and I start to lose confidence. It’s so bad that I start to get super stiff and in my head. I know people say that most people can’t even notice when you’re anxious or whatever but sometimes people do notice. It’s a mixed bag sometimes people just think i’m chill and laid back but I do notice sometimes people act different around me cause they notice i’m a little awkward. I’m not a complete sperg like I can have a general conversation with most people but I notice I can’t maintain eye contact so it just always looks like i’m thinkining intently about something. I also get way too in my head about the other person thinking i’m a weirdo. I don’t wanna get on SSRI’s I don’t believe in that stuff and it fucks with your head. I’ve tried mindfulness and stomach breathing and it helps but sometimes it just isn’t enough. I do also have pretty bad general anxiety I should add. Any advice I really appreciate thank you so much"
5xfcsz,"Time. To. Vent...I'm finally going to try to get help. I'm sure I have SA for as far as I can remember (I'm 21F) and for the few past years it's been getting worst. I let it manifest over my life for too long and it doesn't help I have depression as well. I'm been going through suicidal thoughts thinking I'm a lost caused forever now it's nearly impossible for me to talk to people without my anxiety taking over and me making a big deal out of it all. I can't keep a convo going ever making me uninteresting. I'm extremely slow and forgetful all the time causing me to fuck up a lot of stuff. I tried to drop out of high school so many times because anxiety was taking over. I can't count how many school days I missed during that time because of how pathetic I am. The school wouldn't allow me to drop out though I'm grateful for that now but I haven't done anything for my self sense then. I can't keep relationships with people because I have no motivation to. nnI remember my first job being a example of how pathetic I am. I ended up having panic attack after they tried to move me onto running drive thur orders. I still didn't know the abbreviations for the control board even though I worked longer hours and more days I was the only one at my work that still didn't know them after 3 months of working. The place was new so we all got hired and started working the about the same time. So a lady on the other side ordering yelled at me told me to get the manager she wanted me fired because I kept repeating and asking the same questions and froze and started panicking when I knew I was screwing up. I got yelled at and got called useless by my manager but nothing new. I was getting continue to get bullied by my co workers because of how slow I am when I didn't know work could be like school. They moved me to cleaning the bathrooms everyday from then. One morning getting ready for work I panicked when I couldn't find my name tag and they took that serious so I panicked again over thinking they were going to yell at me again over the 100th time and fire me so I quit on my own only from working 3 months there. I keep thinking every jobs going to be like my first one.nnSo now I'm where I haven't left my house in nearly 3 years now. The last time I did I was taking classes to become a pharmacist tech and I took the classes with a small group of like 5 others so that help keep my anxiety under control. When I finished them and I felt great with myself for the first time in forever but that didn't last very long after pressure caught up with me and I panicked over having to do interviews after awhile I gave up like I always do because I'm like a lost cause... I drifted away from my only friends I had left now I have none. I have a huge trust issue as well. I've been abused by my parents physically and verbally when I was younger, bullied through school and raped by someone who I thought was my friend...nnI've been debating on how to get help for a long time now. The even thought of me picking up the phone to call someone to set up an appointment is terrifying me and the thought of actually sitting there face to face with someone telling them what I've been through all my life specially when I haven't told anyone before is even more terrifying. I'm scared they won't really listen to me anyways and that they will think I'm pitiful which would be in the back of my mind the entire time I'm trying to speak with them. I'm also afraid they may misdiagnosed me with something unrelated. I've been to a psychiatrist before when I was 17 and they didn't listen to what I said instead took my parents words over mine and I have no clue what they diagnosed me with and my parents wouldn't tell me neither. They just tried to forced me to take the meds..but fuck all of this I'm sick of feeling afraid to take a step out the house, to talk to people through phone or the face because of I'm going to pick up that phone and call for an appointment for help. Im going to take a step outside for the first time and nearly 3 years and maybe go for a run to the park while I'm at it. Im not going to sit here and be a lost cause forever. I will not let anxiety stop me this time!"
9imji4," Have any of you found a way to calm your sa?. I’ve had social anxiety for about 4 years now and I still get the same pos feeling anytime I am in public. My main issue now is my underarms sweat and stain my clothes because of my sa. The moment I step into public, my armpits slowly start to become a rain forest lol. I try deep breathing, but when I do I become more aware with the anxious feelings and it doesn’t really help. I feel so hopeless that it will never go away and can’t even enjoy anything public anymore . I really wish I could just ease it a bit. "
axvlce," I wanna get away from everything. I don't want to go to college, get a job and deal with people, I just want to get the fuck away to a cabin in the middle of a mountain where no one bothers me and just live there. "
dm3p4y1," That's awesome!! I am sure that the longer you do it, the easier it gets. Keep going! Anxiety fuels itself from avoidance, so you have to start doing the stuff that scares you and your anxiety will get much better! That's why I'm planning to go backpacking on my own next summer. It's gonna tackle so many of my anxieties and probably be a lot of fun, I'm sk excited about it already. "
99civf," More than just introversion?. Im 16, male, and I believe Im starting to show some signs of Social Anxiety. I have generalised anxiety since I can remember, it appeared in the form of phobias, I would fear dogs, sea waves, elevators, house being robbed and more. Im also a very quiet, shy, teen. Ever since I rememeber I would dislike hanging out with friends and other types of activities, it is introversion. I would like to spend all of my time alone and still like. For the last couple of months I started feeling differences in my behaviour. I started avoiding doing normal things like try getting into a romantic relashionship, going to the market to buy groceries, hanging out with friends. This activities make me fear of being judged by others. I avoid them. I hate being in the spotlight. I can make friends easily, I can talk to them but sometimes I fear I will be judged by them, This does give me some sort of anxiety, I dont cry or anything like a panick attack, my heart just beats a little faster and my breathing too and I get a but sweaty sometimes. To calm myself I need to be alone. Is this the beginning of SA? "
8vqpxb," High Sensitivity/HSP: a useful concept to learn about, might just be relevant to you. Let's get the trivia out of the way: I'm a somewhat too clever for my own good, introverted nerd, who ran into a wall in my late teens to the point where I'd be too scared to go to the bakery because holy shit, I'd make a fool out of myself for sure somehow. I've always been a bit shy/socially anxious, my self-esteem tanked when in college it turned out that for all my bluster I had nothing really to show for myself, started getting a little squirrelly in the head with depression and surviving on peanuts for a week because I was too anxious to get groceries, good stuff. I got my shit together in the ten-ish years since. One thing I learned is about is HSP, Highly Sensitive Person. Basically, just like in a lot of animal species, somewhere around 15-20&amp;#37; of humans are also more intrinsically 'sensitive' than others, meaning they show lowered sensory detection thresholds, a lower bias filter for information, and more thorough processing of information, especially the social/emotionally relevant kinds. The result is that compared to most people, HSP's often prefer having more time to soak up and process information, and they get tired out more quickly. The upside is that this deeper processing can result in pretty neat new angles in thinking, noticing connections better, taking into account a more complete set of variables when trying to problem solve and noticing very subtle things. This leads to a 'vantage sensitivity', basically that if there's beneficial factors in the environment, these get picked up and put to use better than average. Unfortunately negative factors, like critical parents, bullying, economic insecurity etc. also gets taken to heart way more and results in more negative outcomes for HSP's than average. I was actually sort of baffled by research showing that kids that score low on the HSP trait can encounter a scary acting unfriendly adult, and minutes later forget all about it and play happily with other kids in the playground. HSP kids tend to feel unsafe and off-balance and inhibited long after such an unpleasant encounter, showing sustained higher cortisol levels. I'm like what, kids exist that can be spooked like that and 'just not care' immediately after??? Holy shit! I'm certainly the kind to keep my guard up and wonder wtf I did wrong for hours, I thought everyone was like that. Turns out that's not the case. Research also showed that brief positive interventions, like a few workshops on mental health, have a significantly more positive and long-lasting impact on HSP teens compared to average. It shows you can use this to grab hold of support, of good ideas, of helpful advice, and actually do something with it rather than go 'shrug' and go about business as usual. I think it'd be useful for quite a few peeps here to look into this in a bit more detail. Self-understanding and putting into perspective how my own world just looks and feels a little different from many other people helped me be a lot less hard on myself and made me stop expecting me to turn myself into a completely different kind of person. It helped me see that some of my most shameful flaws were the result of a mismanaged asset, and that if I learned to respect and use this trait I have rather than look down on it, I could use it to my advantage. It helped me realise that when other people 'have no problems with this', it might just be because their brain and senses just honestly do not give a fuck, while mine does, because that's how it works. It helped me see that my neurotic over-thinking is just what I do 'naturally', and that I can learn to decide when to give things more thought, and when to go 'alright, there's nothing to gain from chewing this over forever, maybe I need to just let it go and try to move on'. That this is a skill I could learn, like learning how to drive a car, once I realised I have some control over it. Knowing that I 'have' this (it's just a trait, not a disorder, since it's so ass common and it's got it's good aspects) helped me to think of my anxious tendencies as something to learn how to manage, rather than a blemish on myself that I had to try to erase. Maybe not everyone will relate, but I get this niggling feeling it'll be more common here than in the broader population. "
flwehac,"yeah same here man, I started out the year doing so many things that pushed me out my comfort zone. I started playing social soccer again for the first time in 5 years, my university semester started, was going gym regularly even got my first job in like ages. Now all litterely all those things are cancelled. Dont get me wrong all those things stressed me out but atleast I was doing shit instead of panicking out about life curled up in my bed. anyway we'll bounce back"
dhxqwi6,"First, it might be a little late to get a summer job. There's probably college students who do this job that are back now - but it doesn't hurt to ask or leave someone your info if an opening becomes available. nnSecond, I like to think of it this way. When you visit the beach, what are you doing? Probably swimming, tanning, talking with friends, relaxing, maybe even walking or jogging along the water. Heck, you might be sleeping with earbuds and sunglasses on. It's very unlikely that everyone is going to be focusing on your every move. There's so many other things that people are doing while at the beach and I can assure you that none of those things will involve mocking you. I'm from the east coast, so I'm not sure what ""arranging people"" means, but if it's what I think it means (telling people where they will go on the beach?) remember that people see you as the ""employee"" figure and will probably pay little mind once they're on the beach and having fun. If you mess up, apologize. We're human after all. "
dde51b4," Yeah I'm trying to take small steps. I picked up skateboarding again so I have some physical activity and something to work towards. Some days at work are better than others but most of the time it's extremely difficult for me to even try to put any effort. Thanks for the advice, hopefully it'll get better for both of us! "
drlrqbd,"Hang in there buddy. There are soooo much more to appreciate in life than just having friends , if u got nothing to say or your suffering from  social anxiety then u should put more effort in YOU for example try: to read a couple books , draw what ur feeling , watch new kinds of movies , put time and effort to food to make it delicious , play videogames , go for a walk or buy a gym membership and most imortantly find therapy help for ur problems."
fhfdjb9,"Shit, I did the same thing. I had to interview people at a park. I walked around the entire park, trying to build up courage, before eventually giving up. I just made up some answers. It's always the getting started part that is the hardest for me. Still struggle with it. I'm a little better now as I get older, but I will still do things like sit in the car for 15 minutes before I head into a meeting."
ju5efr,"Having developed social anxiety since childhood, I now don't know how to undo all the negative coping mechanisms as an adult + CBT and meds not working?. For context, I'm a 23 year old female who grew up in a pretty conservative society and was never really exposed or educated on the idea of mental illness. My only understanding or view of mental illness (until I was 18?!) was the word ""crazy"" and the image that is often portrayed by Hollywood - people screaming and being violent etc, often in an asylum setting. I remember none of this, but as a child, apparently my teachers have always pointed out to my parents that I seemed pretty ""anti-social"" and quiet. My kindergarten teacher once asked my mother if I had autism, and my 5th grade elementary school teacher also spoke to my mum about my unusual quietness and ""anti-social"" personality. Also growing up unaware of mental illnesses other than the classic TV portrayal, my mum thought nothing of it and chalked it up to me being a shy child. I've always experienced pretty bad anxiety (mainly social anxiety), especially when I had to go for school camps, or school orientations where we'd be grouped with strangers and generally expected to be active and excited etc. I'd always experience the dread, the choking feeling in my throat, the heavy weight on my chest, the nausea, withdrawing into my own head, and feeling as if I'm underwater. Of course I never thought of this as anxiety, I just knew I was scared and that I wanted to run away no matter what. I never knew how (still don't) to make friends properly, or how to approach people. And whenever I do approach someone and make some sort of conversation with them, if I see them approach another person without me, I'd always think ""oh they prefer to talk to each other, I'm gonna have no friends"". It's obviously irrational and stupid, but I always ended up feeling awkward, antisocial and friendless, and worse - like I was viewed as such. To that end, when it comes to things like orientations or camps, my extreme anxiety often led to terrible nausea, and I'd ultimately just end up going to the doctors, getting a medical certificate and skipping those few days. This is despite the fact that I knew I was only going to the doctor's in order to be able to skip school for those few days, but the nausea made it easier for me to convince the dr. But most importantly, because I was afraid of being viewed negatively, I never told anyone about how I felt, what went through my head, or what I experienced. So no one ever knew about my anxiety. Forwarding to the present, I now live in Australia, and having been exposed to a society that (more) freely talked about mental health, I was able to identify my experiences as unusual, and only recently managed to get myself diagnosed(?)* by a clinical psychologist as having social anxiety disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and depression. Under my psychologist, I went through about a year of monthly/bimonthly CBT and mindfulness-based therapy. And more recently, I have also taken up medication. I have tried citalopram (Celexa), mirtazapine, and now venlafaxine (Effexor). The former 2 was only taken short-term (a month each) as they were changed by my GPs, plus mirtazapine made me too groggy to function. Effexor was the only one I've tried long-term (a year). ##### Now, the problem here is, I've always coped with my anxiety by avoiding situations that causes it where I can. My first clear memory of myself experiencing anxiety was when I was in 4th grade, although I'm sure I've had it since I was a lot younger, and even then, my first instinct was to avoid and get out of the situation. After more than 10 years of avoidant coping techniques, it seems to be ingrained in me right now. CBT and mindfulness doesn't seem to help because I always know that my ""logic"" was irrational, and I knew that for e.g. it's fine if I don't do super well at work especially when I jsut started, but the point is, despite knowing these, I still felt the dread anyway. So when CBT is used to challenge my thoughts, it doesn't seem to work for me because I already know the correct logic, I just still feel anxious. I also haven't been able to see any change since I started taking Effexor and am now doubting its effectiveness. Granted, my external situation's been pretty stressful and uncertain, so my depression's gotten worse and I've been avoiding social contact for a while now. So if it was in fact effective, the accompanying regression in my current situation would probably have negated any progress made. So my question is, to anyone who has experienced social anxiety since childhood and has ingrained negative coping mechanisms, how did you overcome it? Did CBT work for you? Another question would be - should I request to get on a different medication? I've been reflecting a lot and realised that I had regressed pretty heavily, and am hence seeking advice from the community. Hope you guys don't mind the text wall! Stay safe ❤️ ##### *Not sure if I was ""diagnosed"" as she only mentioned that it seemed like I had these disorders, and while I know for sure that I do have those disorders, I'm still unsure if that counts as an offical diagnosis. _________________________ TLDR: to anyone who has experienced social anxiety since childhood and has ingrained negative coping mechanisms, how did you overcome it? Did CBT work for you? If not, what did? Should I request to get on a different medication if I don't think my medication helped at all (even after 1 year of taking it)?"
6h1ihr," Well I went to the park.. And it was horrible. I was so hot, and all the spots with shade were either taken or next to the kids playground and I didn't want to sit there and look like a pedo. So I sat on the line bench in the middle of a field by myself for 10-15 minutes and then walked home. I did it I guess. But fuck I'm hot and tired and anxious as fuck. "
e2l5ha6," Maybe you could try working in a warehouse if that’s possible? Moving boxes and lifting objects around? Your options really are limited if you’re not willing to do virtually anything a minimum wage job requires. I suggest maybe googling things like “jobs for people with social anxiety” or “low stress jobs for teens” or something. Worst case you could try picking up odd jobs around your neighborhood, mowing lawns and things like that. Remember though in the future you’ll really need to start trying to put yourself out there more.. I know it’s not what you might want to hear but when you’re in the process of trying to establish an actual career, you won’t be able to just skirt by and blame your anxiety for your unemployment. "
d8nmg73," You should tell the university staff about this,they can offer counseling and from what i know,you can take off a semester or a year due to sickness(in this case social anxiety).If it becomes too unbearable,i strongly suggest that you put uni on a hold for now,get back home,get some therapy and then return.In the meanwhile,try to attend classes and make everything possible to distract yourself and keep your mind entertained:browse reddit,9gag,youtube,listen to music,read a book etc.Anything basically that can help.Also,hang out with your partner as much as possible,talk to him about your issues,it really helps when you have someone to vent off to. Even if you don't know how to cook,try!Read a recipe and practice at night when no one can disturb you.Take a walk in evening,try to exercise abit everyday so you don't become trapped in your room,which trust me,it won't do you any better.Try at least to do something productive every day and you'll feel somewhat accomplished and happier with yourself. Best of luck to you! "
dz629a2,"I was really out going in elementary school, pretty much made friends with everyone. Then I switched to a posh private school and for some reason I developed terrible SA. I felt like I was being judged for just about everything \(Hell, I'd hide among a patch of trees to avoid everyone else during recess\). Things have gotten better since then but my SA still lingers.. "
4dm5jj," Group meetup in one hour.. I guess I just want to vent. There's this group of people I know and we're kinda like friends, I'm more at ease with some of them but we all get a long well. From time to time we have gettogethers. One thing I can't stand is that I ALWAYS feel anxious and out of my mind before an upcoming meetup. I've been really tense all day. It's like...I don't want to go, but then again I don't want to be left out, especially since we all try to match our schedules so that everyone could go. When I'm there usually I manage fine, I don't talk at all or anything and I don't want to, but still it feels so forced from my side being there, trying to look calm and smile (even though I'm actually just doing my best to look normal), I can never be relaxed etc. even though I have no prior incidents with them that should make me anxious. However I tend to make my life more difficult as well. I don't have a car but one of the people could pick me and someone else up and drive us back but since I absolutely want to leave at 10PM and at the same time hate to be the one to end the sitting, I will take my bike instead (double fail if I still end the sitting by leaving and then get to ride the bike back instead of inside a comfy car). And it started raining now, oh joy. Already took anti anxiety medication and have thought everything over more times I can count, not to mention the past 4 hours I've been unable to focus on anything. It's just so frustrating how a simple meetup I know will very likely turn out ok (since they always have so far) will still make me feel so timid. Is my whole life going to be like that? Thanks for reading. If you have anything to add, I'd love to read it once I get back :) UPDATE: Just as I very accurately predicted, all went perfectly fine. No anxiety once I was there, was feeling quite ok, even managed to speak some myself and got all the support. Excused myself exactly at 10PM, didn't cause anyone else to leave. Hurts to think that next time it would all repeat again (the initial anxiety) "
e2kyw8k," For gym luckily we didn’t have to participate but we just had to dress up. When I first walked into the gym room I got anxiety. I would do my normal thing try to act cool and walk up to the bleachers to sit alone. Dressing in the room was the worst, not to mention sitting in a room while everyone can clearly see your just a fucking loner. It was painful and I hated gym class. One day all of us for some reason had to go to the gym room to workout. You know what I did? I faked being asleep and slept the entire period alone in the gym and the worst part was when they came back. God the cringe. I had to explain to the coach why I didn’t come. Here lies the story of my terrible gym experience. Sorry lol. "
eec02pr," Same, one of my hobbies is just going to a coffee shop alone and surfing the web on my laptop. But I find it hard to say that because it doesn’t sound that cool to people unless they know the exact feeling I get when I’m relaxing like that. "
ol68zb," I want to quit my job so much but I hate confrontation. I'm the kind of person that's just bad at ending things. You know when you need to end a relationship and they keep giving solutions to every motive you have? If you are bad with confrontation and setting boundaries you end up stuck. I'm dying inside every day I work. My mental health is in crambles. I want some time to get healthier and study, but I don't know how to quit my job. I know my boss will try to give me solutions and will want me to stay and I'm so bad at saying no. I also feel so guilty. They are nice with me. I'll disappoint them all. I need to keep dying inside so they are happy. I can't make them mad or sad. How do I quit? What will I say that sounds reasonable and not open for solutions? I'm so desperate I just want to run away and give up everything and live in a mountain. Why social interactions have to be so hard I just can't survive having to deal with people and feelings and disappoinment. I just want to send a long text and block them so I don't read the answers cause I'm so scared. But I need to do this in person and suffer. Why. Why everything is so hard. "
fhfunnp,"Jailbait by Ted Nugent might work lol. I also admit I’ve secretly named the lady who walks by Karen. She’s just very obnoxious and it seemed to fit lmao. It just seems so odd that an older man (Phil is retired) and an almost 40 year old Karen would care so much about what I do in the morning or at all. If my lawn was a foot high and had car parts covering it then sure. But I mean come on, pajamas and not raking? And now that I type that out I realize how social anxiety was truly getting the best of me. I guess that’s the thing though. We sometimes freak out and make mountains out of mole hills with social situations. Thank you for the laugh and smile. I really needed it and feel a lot better 😊"
dev78zw,"I, like you, know exactly how depression feels. How it feels like you're stuck in quicksand. The longer you're in it®the worse it becomes.nnBut I must echo what Sonicon2 said. I've learned that the best way to solve depression is to take baby steps. Basically, just get yourself outside the house, and do something small.nnBecause, the longer you stay trapped in your own space, depressed, the worse it becomes.nnWhat I want you to try tomorrow, is, first thing, do some form of exercise. Go for a short jog. Lift some weights. Do some pushups.nnThis will get you outside your mind®where the depression exists®and into your body.nnThe next step, shortly after you exercise, is to take some kind of SMALL action. nn* Go to a coffee shop and order coffee. n* Walk around the mall. Maybe someone will be sitting on a bench. Maybe you can wave to that person and acknowledge them. Maybe, if you're feeling up to it, you can sit down and ask them how their day is going.n* Go for a walk in your neighborhood or in the park. Everyone you pass by, wave and acknowledge them. nnThese small steps are what will allow you to progressively become more comfortable. And they will also make you feel better. Because instead of being trapped in your head, worrying about your life situation, you're in your body and your giving out positive energy to the world.nnThe more positive energy you give to the world®the more positive energy you will receive."
f093ag4," Ugh, I know the feeling. But, there's actually nothing wrong in saying ""I went out for a walk, it was nice"", because if you look around a lot of people do that and it's perfectly acceptable. Social anxiety just makes us think other people might think we're weird for hanging out by ourselves, but honestly it's really in our heads. "
ow0ml9,"I'm 17 and my mom was overprotective. Hello, I'm a 17 years old boy from Romania and my mom, since I was a little kid was overprotective with me, this meaning that I had to stay mostly at my house, just being lonely . Over time I started to like this loneliness as I discovered the PC and the wonders of it and the amount of things you could do on it. This summer tho I managed to make her let me outside more. Great right? Well no, not actually. During these years I was just me with myself I became some kind of introvert and my social skill are the worse as they could get. I managed to make some friends(mostly boys) which had the same hobbies as me (listening to music, video games and football) . But the problem isn't here, the problem is with girls. I know that it is a very basic problem but I really dont know what to talk with girls, to keep the conversation going, to make her laugh, to make her ask me the questions(as most of the time I end up being weird by just asking a lot of different questions). This should be 1 problem , another one is that I catched feelings for a girl that I don't even know her very well. I just stay thinking about her, making me loose sleep, and as you thought she doesn't even respond to my messages on ig. I know it might sound very dumb, but I dont even know if i want a girlfriend , it just happend for me to catch feelings I feel weird asking this, when I never even really talked about my feelings with anyone at all, so please go easy on me 😀."
dkrb4m8," Maybe approach people who seem outgoing. On the phone you never know who's on the other end. More challenging for you! If you approach someone and it goes badly quickly explain the purpose and apologize for bothering them. Do this stuff in person! I can make prank calls like hell but I can't go to a pizza place and ask the workers weird questions. Try a library aisle and ask someone around you if they're looking for the same book, what book they're looking for etc. I feel weird biking past the furniture store mascot who waves at everyone. he probably feels weird waving at everyone "
fdjczxp," I usually go to the track during the evenings when it’s just getting dark, so there’s not usually people there. But other times I’ll go during the day and what I do is just put my headphones on and put my hood up and focus on my running. You’ll loosen up once you start moving/huffing and puffing "
fswb1q9," Change your instructor, look for a personal older experienced one. Reason I say this is because they are much more relaxing to be around, mine was an older gentleman who was very reassuring and classy. If you get a relationship of trust with your instructor you’ll be less anxious. As for tips on relaxing behind the wheel, first master residential areas with less traffic to get the basics down perfectly. Then transition to higher traffic areas, practice left hand turns, merging into lanes, memorizing traffic light layouts etc. Leave the highway for last, drivers are at their worst out there, if you realize 90% of the risk is other drivers out there you’ll realize driving is just muscle memory. Keep going, and don’t forget Spongebob once passed the boating school exam 😀. "
mlr6e5," Anxiety. Having severe anxiety has literally pushed me to the point of not talking to a soul other than my mom and my doberman. I am a hermit crab, haven't used any social media in many years. I think everybody is out to get me and I'm just different than everybody. I used to be ""normal"" and had friends and girlfriends and all that stuff. I have since ruined every bit of those relationships because nobody can understand why I feel this way and I can't explain it out of pure embarrassment. Growing up in the NC in a small town, there is a stigma around mental health and if you have a problem then your automatically labeled as crazy, it's unfortunate but common in small country towns especially. I went to 3 different high schools and played Varsity basketball on a state champ runner up team as a freshman all the way up till I dropped out because of the anxiety and pressure to succeed my junior year. But for the life of me, when I absolutely have too talk to somebody in the past few years my heart starts pounding and I feel like Im having to talk the devil himself no matter who it is. Even over the phone I'm constantly concerned about my next word and have to try not to stutter because I'm shaking nervous on the inside. Literally I get that feeling you get before your about to fight somebody every single time and it's debilitating and nobody understand it. I'm a 6ft 5 200lb 25 year old white male with sleeve tattoos, when somebody looks at me, they would never think I have what I have. It's extremely hard to explain to people unless you have it too and I'm just looking for some advice from anybody that has been thru a something similar to my situation so maybe I can get some relief. Thanks in advance to anyone that can help me and I appreciate it more than you'll ever know. "
fw4mzme," This is something I've been working on for awhile, and I've had some success in two areas: Theres no other way to say this, but maybe try talking to ""weird"" people. I don't mean any offense by that, I'm just using it to describe the large array of people that most wouldn't label as average. People that dress in alt fashion, bright dyed hair, lots of tattoos. People that probably share or can at least empathize with your position. There's a girl who works at my head shop, and for some reason if I can get past the anxiety of being outdoors and in a public place I've actually come to know her quite well and I always hope she's there when I stop by. Another thing you could try, and this worked REALLY well for me when I first tried to challenge myself, just being in a situation where suddenly having to excuse yourself is completely understandable. I'm always afraid I'll have to just stand up and walk away to avoid crying, and what either stops me or haunts me is what is probably going through their head if/when it happens. The two extremes are they think they did something wrong and I don't want to hurt their feelings, or that they're confused by my actions and think I'm strange. Public places are nice, if you think you might start to break down, you could glance at your watch and mention you'll miss your bus if you don't leave now. If you're inside a building you could say you're waiting for an Uber when you introduce yourself, and at anytime you could glance at your phone and say your Uber is arriving. You could look at this as lying, and it is, but I personally think it's better than the other two extremes. I hope one of these helps, and if not to at least let you understand you're not alone. Good in you for making a conscious effort to move forward and heal, I wish you the best of luck! "
e9i5l4t, They are really nice. :) I usually go metal detecting at night. Children playgrounds are a prime target. 
mimo33,"My SA Journey so far. So I'm 21M and was recently diagnosed with social anxiety. Now my case is weird because I was born with a speech disorder and the symptoms of SA are almost identical to the anxiety a stutterer can face. But ever since I was a child my speech overall has really improved, the anxiety hasn't though. Having SA is one thing to deal with, but I also have to deal with a stutter on top??? So now in social situations I m faced with automatic response social anxiety symptoms along with the thoughts of ""well I better not stutter"". It's not the best combination to have and this combination has made me really fearful of ALL types of social interactions such as having a full time job, participating in class, going out to social outtings, family events, etc. I definitely have more of a SA problem then speech problem I would say. So I decided to do things to help myself (in theory they are supposed to help). I went to CBT and only had the money for 5 sessions. Our sessions we're relaxed, understanding, and he helped me with identifying one fearful situation I could change to make myself feel more comfortable (wedding ceremony if that ever happens lol) but I got a long ways to go with CBT. It was mostly aimed at changing thoughts but I am way more concerned with the automatic anxious feelings I get that I feel I can't control. I've been taking Prozac for a while but I have no idea what it has done. I may have to experiment with social anxiety medications (if any have helped you I am all ears) I tried meditation which helps temporarily for myself. My mo had really bad anxiety in her thirties, she meditated for 10 years, and claims she has practically cured herself, which is amazing for her. If you experience physical symptoms of anxiety to an overwhelming degree you should try propranolol it really helps me and I use it very little. I tried CBD oil and it made me 20% more relaxed. I take it before social things like family events or before I go into school or next in my life, work. I decided to lose 46 pounds and continue to lose. This is just a small self-steem building block to help with confidence in social situations. I try to run most days and eat healthy everyday. I read a book called Eat to Beat Depression and Anxiety by Drew Ramsey. I didn't use the recipes but he offers tons of information on optimal brain nutrients and vitamins you should aim for in your diet to help 'manage depression' which often is accompanied by anxiety. I figured speech may be the cause of my anxiety too (it definitely contributes but I don't stutter that much it could be WAY WAY worse). So I joined a speech program and worked at its methods really hard for 2 months straight. I really improved. Then I stopped doing the exercises and I am still benefitting from what they have taught me but I should be treating those speech exercises like working out - do it everyday. I can truly say the only thing that drastically improved my social anxiety was COVID-19. I no longer had to go into school with a pounding heart and hating each day, day after day of heart pounding, avoiding stuttering, and being engulfed in socially anxious thoughts. I sit at home, complete my homework, drink a little at night, hangout with a friend or 2, things I just generally enjoy (things that don't make me feel like a weird human being haha). So eventually within a year I will have to get a full time job. Terrifying haha. I am hoping that I will eventually get comfortable at work because most of my life until moving to a new college I was always SOMEWHAT comfortable at school. But since moving to the latest school I experienced chronic social anxiety as soon as I stepped foot on the campus. So I don't know how many of you in this forum are 'recovered' or have found ways to help manage your social anxiety, but I am all ears. I would love to hear what path you took with social anxiety if you learned to manage it. Hopefully some of the information I put here is relatable or helpful. Thank you for reading."

I've made a document listing the causes, symptoms and fixes of what I believe to be social anxiety. I really don't know if I really do have a problem or if my problems aren't actually real and I just need to ""get over it"" and that they are just general teenage hormones. I want to ask my doctor for a diagnosis but I'm scared that he/she will just laugh it off and not take it serious. From the ages of 1-6, I lived with both parents. My Dad was abusive to my Mum. I vividly remember her sobbing behind a locked bathroom door. This probably caused some underlying psychological problems. From ages 6-14, I didn't see my Dad once. My Mum died when I was 14 which my Dad took advantage by trying to get back into my life. I don't know if I can trust him. I want to but I don't think I can. All of my life, I have had terrible relationships and outlooks on society because of my broken family which I assume is the reason for my lack of trust around other people.  and#x200B; Causes: Getting ready for school, walking to school and being at school causes the most anxiety in my life. Being at school causes the most anxiety of the 3. Followed by walking to school and getting ready for school. I can control my anxiety the most when it is at its lowest levels. So, the anxiety when **getting ready for school** (showering, getting dressed, eating breakfast, checking that I have everything for the day) can be managed the most out of the 3. I find it very hard to manage my anxiety on **the way to school**. My anxiety **at school** is **completely out of my control**. Although I am not always anxious at school, the majority of the time (95% of the time), I am very anxious. I have no idea how I can control it at all. Nothing works. Things that work at home, don't work at school and I can’t think rationally. Symptoms: * Sweating * Goosebumps * Tense vocal cords * Can’t speak loudly in crowded places * Blocked nose * Tics - constant fiddling with things in my hands, repetitive biting/grinding on back teeth, forcing myself to exhale air * Biting lip/tucking it into my mouth * Jaw feels heavy - I don’t know how to relax my jaw * Constantly out of breath * Feeling like I am on the verge of crying * Shaky/jittery neck when looking around * Generally feeling on edge when people can see me. * Constant fear of being abandoned by the people that I am hanging out with * Constant fear of being confronted * An urge to escape from the room that I am in * Hard to swallow/unable to swallow normally * Fear of making eye contact/negatively evaluating any eye contact that I make * A voice in my head telling me how people think of me (always negative thoughts) * Generally feeling empty of emotions but racing with negative thoughts * Feeling drained once my anxiety goes away (after school) * Constantly dreading every part of my school day * General low self esteem, confidence and just a shitty feeling through my body * Feeling and believing that there is no way out of my anxiety - From my experience, there simply isn’t an escape! *  and#x200B;  and#8203; Things that help: * When at school, going inside a toilet cubicle (where I’m secluded from people) reduces my anxiety drastically. I still feel anxious but it is a lot more bearable. I think that if I was in a fully enclosed opaque and sound-proof box, my anxiety would drop to 0. * Boxing/punching bag at home * Going for a walk (if my anxiety is low-medium. If it is high, like when at school, it makes things worse * Crying/breaking down - This is hard to do, though, because I can’t cry much. So it isn’t a sustainable technique. I also don’t have any privacy to cry - both at school and at home. * Weed can reduce the physical symptoms. After smoking, I feel more comfortable in my body but I still have the same anxious thoughts."
7mq3xn," Why does it come so naturally to everyone else?. It seems like everyone around me floats through social interactions with ease, meanwhile I'm drowning. I can take a drug and have a life preserver, but everyone else is on a boat. Even if I put a bunch of effort into being more social, I would still be behind everyone who can make connections without even trying. "
l4zesu," DAE relate or no?. So I never really had friends just acquaintances because i was cool with mostly everyone and would chit chat with people here and there for a few seconds or minutes, but i never knew how to actually have conversations with people and how to get to know more about someone so that we could become friends or close friends. Even now the thought of trying to go out to make friends is like a no for me lol like when i go on my walks to the park i may wave and say hi and keep it walking, but the thought of trying to approach people at the park and talking to them so that maybe we could become friends is terrifying like first of all i suck at socializing and conversing with others and second what do i say what could we talk about? I can't just walk up to someone and say ""hey want to be friends""? And I'm not a bar,party, or club person so going places like that is a major pass for me, but yeah i know those are frequent places people go to to meet people and maybe even the mall, but then again i don't like crowds and I'm not much of a mall person.. Also it's not even about me not knowing how to approach others irl but also if someone were to approach me trying to talk to me i would feel awkward and anxious feeling like i just want to run and hide.😂 "
dtimn52," I’m working at a golf course , it is very SA friendly. I am the only person working on carts. I sit in the garage and bring carts out in morning, golfers take them, I wash them as they come in. And that’s about the entirety of my job :D "
kuflqw,"I need help regarding friendships and social interactions. I am a 16 year old girl with very few ""friends"", who aren't really friends but just classmates I talk to... So I am not social like how most moroccans are. I feel like I am stuck in a loop: I am very reserved so I don't talk to people, and by not talking to people, I feel sad and alone so I want to have friends. But I can't even gather the courage to talk to a stranger, so I feel sad again... My trust issues make it even harder for me to talk to people. This started at my old school: I used to have a lot of friends when I was seven or eight, and I talked a lot. The years passed, and those friends ended up leaving the school, leaving me alone. My parents didn't like to let me go outside alone because our neighborhood wasn't kid-friendly, so I didn't have friends outside of school. Time passed on, and I didn't make any effort in making new friends, because at that time I thought that it was up to them to talk to me (stupid 8 y.o me). So basically what I did was sit back and observe the other students. It was a private school, so of course we had some spoiled girls in our school. Those girls were just the embodiment of the popular girls in american movies, and I hated them. Only one of them was kind to me, and even yelled at her friends for making me cry when I didn't know the answer of a question. Their behavior, the whole evil snake thing they did, just made me not trust any girl. So I didn't even try for the following years to have any friends because I didn't want to be involved. It got worse in middle school (that's collège right?), because they were basically just drama queens at this point. They lied to each other, put on fake smiles only to talk behind their backs, spread rumors to ruin friendships... I could have tried to talk to guys, but because I never talked to any guy in primary school, I had no clue how. It felt weird for me. So I ended up feeling all alone and depressed. I had no one to talk to in breaks. I followed people around like a lost puppy because I am lost when I am alone... It is better now in my new high school. The girls are actually nice people and not snakes, the boys are... still immature jerks but they aren't as immature as the ones in my old school. But... I still can't shake the feeling that they are talking behind my back... I mean, I am a perfect bullying target when you think about it... I developed this behavior, where in class I always sit right next to the wall, at the back, so I can observe the other students because I don't trust them. Or when I do something and I hear someone talking afterwards, or just looking at me and then talking, I just start eavesdropping on them because I am scared that they are talking about me. I am very scared about what I will become in the future, right now I can't even talk to strangers without feeling like my heart will give out. Thanks to anyone who reads this, I just wanted to rant. Have a nice day. (If this isn't the right subreddit, I can delete this)"
dth12es,"Fellow Bonnaroo attendee here, 2013. Let me tell you something, the farm is absolutely massive, you are not going to be singled out for anything. You can be the biggest square or the biggest stoner and you won’t be judged for anything. For the most part, people’s attention gets drawn to the wacky men walking around damn near naked (only saw 1 guy when I went) and the occasional topless and painted up women (seen plenty). If you don’t like being stuck in a crowd there’s plenty of breathing room at the back of the crowd, or you can just walk around the creativity/shopping area. The only part you might get a bit anxious about is the walking around the camping area and waiting in line for the portapottys. Just a tip, find out when they clean the portapottys and use them then, they are usually line free for about 10 to 15 minutes. Hope you enjoy it."
eps9qk1, well they already know. i kind of blame them for it cause i was fine before i had to move. but they act like its my fault that i dont have friends. they are forcing me to go to summer camp in hopes that ill find people there so hopefully that works out. i know they want the best for me and they're trying. i have a sister but she's like way older than me but i still talk to her sometimes. i have cousins too but they have really busy social lives and dont really have time for me. 
fmjjn9r,"YES, I completely get that. I'm about to be 18 and I feel the same way. Besides school, the only time I really leave my house is when my mom drives me to like a local park or strip mall to go shopping and get food from the drive-thru. I feel so behind my peers, it's like I wasted my high school years alone stuck in my room and just realized it now. I guess the good thing is that at least we're still young and are aware that we're not where we want to be and we can take steps to improve, I mean some people never figure it out. I sincerely hope things get better for you."
bbb4la," I’m having ptsd because of my new neighbor.. I was severely bullied for 3 years by one of my closest friends. We where friends before he turned on me. The dude had red hair, and the person who bought the house right next door to me has red hair. I’ve asked several Facebook friends who also knew him to find out if it was my bully. They both said no, but I still have this fear that the person that really set my social anxiety into motion lives literally a foot away from me.....even if it’s not him it’s like having a walking reminder of the person who made me feel less than human and it’s making me feel everything I’ve tried to run away from. And making it like I can’t even live at my own house anymore. I refuse to go outside in the backyard because they can clearly see me if I’m out there, I’m afraid to walk to my car because what if they do a meet and greet with the new neighbors. Somehow my brain feels that if there’s even a chance that it’s him I’m frozen. What if those people lied to me? What if he told them to say it’s not him? And it’s making me literally crazy. "
do16xt6," Do you know what he is interested in? Guys generally like doing activity type dates rather than sitting in uncomfortable silence in the movie theatres. Maybe ask him to go to crazy golf or the arcade or something kind of like a fun childish activity. It depends on what he likes. As for how to ask him just casually slip it into conversation. Like if it's friday and you guys are talking about what your plans are for the weekend, you could say something like 'so you're free saturday afternoon, we could go do such and such if you're up for it.' Try not to over think it. If you find out his plans first you'll know when he is available. "
fdm2nni, I guess that the start of the semester will have lots of newbies like yourself. It was that way with the running team I joined. 
d7v1ufb," My no. 1 fear of humiliation. I was bullied for my self-view as someone who didn't like soccer in middle school, and people started calling me ""computer geek"" and if I ran in the courtyard they would point fingers and laugh because anything ""sporty"" about me would stick out as not-me like. If someone saw me knocking a basket-ball in the floor they would be like ""dude, lmao, HEY EVERYONE LOOK, Linkenski is playing Basket xD"" I'm still fucking struggling over something that happened between 10-year-old me and peers back then and I'm 23. I really should try therapy for this, because I want to be able to mingle with people without being afraid someone wants to play sports with me. For the longest time I was convinced that this was the root to all my problems and I still do think it is in some ways, but then I met someone who clearly had anxiety or something too but he always joined in when people played soccer anyways and yet he doesn't talk to anybody outside of the play. So for a while I was convinced that he was example enough that sports wasn't a cause for my anxiety. "
dpprfhs," Yes, I understand this exactly. I never really fully developed a hobby growing up besides like reading and writing because of a few factors, but mainly because I was scared of people judging me and I didn't want to start a hobby and not be as good as the other people who were already doing it. I think you just have to find a hobby you really love and force yourself to go with it and do it, despite other people or what your brain is telling you they're thinking of you (also, most people aren't judging you and don't care how skilled or not skilled you are.) For example, I figured out when I was 15 I loved horses and horseback riding, and I started taking lessons at a barn where children as young as 9 or 10 were better than me. It was okay, though, because I loved it and I felt confident doing it. "
qi83d3,"i feel like i have wasted my life. I feel like i, myself wasted the best years of my life, whenever i see any sort of romanticisation of childhood and teenage on the tele or the internet it triggers me to a concerning degree, I've utterly wasted the those years which are supposed to be happy and carefree. Whenever i have this conversation with my mum she tries to console me that they were good and we end up having a fight, she's the only one I'm close to, I'm **very, very** my bad at putting my feelings into words even in my mind and we end up having a fight, i don't know how to explain it to her why i feel that way, i used to go to parks but stuck to one slide the whole time cause i was scared of the bigger slide and also that it was crowded with other kids, i did go outside to play with kids but i was never selected in their teams, in school i was one of those kids that sat on the side watching other kids play, one day i realized, I've spent my whole life sitting in the side. Kobe wouldve never been great if he had discovered ball at 21 ( which I'm going to be in a few months) no matter how much he practiced. People use Tyson Fury as a motivational example, that how he was super depressed and suicidal but even at his lowest moments he still knew that he was a boxer, he had boxing as a thing that he could work on,  use it as an anchor to climb out of the pit he's in, at his worst point he could still think that hey i *was* a nice boxer, i don't have anything like that, i don't have such an anchor, I HAVE NOTHING. No matter what i do i suck at it, I'm so bad at literally everything and i mean it when i say literally. What am i supposed to do at this point, i have no idea, my life is the most boring, blandest thing in this world, always has been"
tb84ym,"Family gathering vacation. Hello everyone, hope you are all doing well! Got you a little TLDR if that's more your thing: When I'm around my father's side of the family I revert back to my heavy socially anxious, insecure, passive and shy version of myself. ---- Since a few years my grandparents run a vacation for close family (them and their children, grandchildren). I'm a 17M and don't speak a lot with my family. I try to visit my grandparents often. I just don't know what to talk about. I miss a connection with them all. With my mother's side it is better, but her family is small. My father's side sense of comedy is making someone else the butt of the joke but in a way that it isn't funny at all to me. Or it's just confusing for me, I just think it's mean behaviour only realising way later they were joking. They also think very narrowly minded. My cousin is in therapy and she always tells me that all people that work in psychology aren't right in the head. That they are crazy (I guess she knows because surely she isn't there to work out some problems herself right?) These generalisations are made so often. There is no freedom for new experience. It feels limiting. Or this one: a few months ago my cousin wanted to play cards with my brother and uncles. Then my father and uncle said that she wasn't allowed to play along because it wasn't for girls. My cousin got mad/upset and my father and uncle (she's her father) just laughed. My cousin started crying and ran away. After awhile they said they were just kidding and she was allowed to play cards with them. She forgave them just like that. I don't get this sense of humor or behaviour to each other. I feel alienated. My little brother is way more social with them, hanging out together often. I hate that I can't fit in the same and I'm afraid I'll end up going the same path as my older cousins who decided to leave the family. One broke contact, the other went far away. This is confusing for me too. I don't understand what happened and it's clearly something we are not supposed to talk about too much. There's a emotional block in place where everyone believes everything will be fine in the end without having to take action. I feel awkward around my family. I hate it. Everywhere I go, I feel confident and ready to talk and love to make people laugh. Sure the moments of stress are there but it doesn't define my behaviour as much. But when I'm around my family I become this very socially anxious, insecure, passive version of myself. I shut my mouth and when I get made fun of I just smirk it off. I can take spending the holidays with them for now, I live with my parents so I'll spend Christmas where they want for now. It feels so awkward. I feel alienated. There is nothing to talk about. It's like we live in totally different worlds. At school I take pride in being different, but with family I feel ashamed of myself. But waking up with them for a whole weekend kills me inside every time. I feel damaged and it takes awhile for me to become myself again. I was really happy when a school trip was planned in the same period as the vacation. I felt relief. I shouldn't feel relief, I should be happy to spend time with them. I know showing up means a lot to my dad and grandparents. The school trip got cancelled and friends asked me if I wanted to hang out the same weekend as the vacation. And I would have taken making a fire on the beach any day over spending the weekend with family. Does anyone have advice on being myself with family and how to reduce the surge in sudden social anxiety?"

jcdv5h,"Why do groups of people notice/stare at me in public or even laugh/giggle?. I don’t look like a creep. I dress casually but not flashy. I am only 19. I look kinda young. I am a quiet person and introverted. I have social anxiety, but I have meds for it and they work thankfully. I go outside alone and hang out in nice places in the night. I have no friends that hang out with me. Only classmates and acquaintances. Just now a group of 4 men kept glancing back at me and I gave the hand gesture “What is it?” and then they talked in their language and walked slowly. Then I walked past them, a minute later a group of women noticed me and walked away from my direction and laughed hysterically and gossiped in their language. Idk. Does this mean I look like a creep without being aware of it? If that’s the case, fuck my genetics."
rqwswp,"People look at me and talk about me in public. I have dealt with social anxiety most of my life. I am not a shy person, but whenever I am outside I feel like I get judged a lot. I am a 25 year old male. I would not consider myself ugly, although I am not really sure. I have not had problems with dating or so on, I have been called cute a lot, but I am not super attractive either. I guess I am a little big above average, or at least I think of myself as that. However, I think there is something ""wrong"" with my face, but I don't know what it is. For whatever reason, let's say I am with my friends and we're sitting at a restaurant (this actually happened yesterday), then I can look around me and catch a couple sitting far away. And the boyfriend looks at me, then turns around to his girlfriend, says something (I am aware of all of this at the same time because I am looking at them) and then she turns and looks at me, then they both look at each other and start to smile in a weird way, almost as if they are trying to prevent themselves from laughing. This happens a lot, and it's usually the same f\*cking scenario all the time. It also happens with just males; some guy catching my eyes, then looks at his friend and tells him something and then that guy starts looking at me, they turn around and smiles at each other. They usually don't laugh, but it has happened. Also one time when I stood in line, it was dark outside, I wasn't wearing anything weird in particular, maybe some working pants, and I was wearing a cap.. and I see this group of guys sitting inside a pizza place, one of the guys catches me, and then tells his friends about me, and then they all turn around and stare. It got me so pissed off that I even walked towards them and they stopped looking at me, and I turned around and walked back. Another time I was outside there were two guys who looked at my pants. I was just wearing normal black pants, and the guy said something to his friend. I knew he was looking at the back of my pants, like my ass/thighs, and I looked later trying to find something wrong like a stain or something but I couldn't see anything there. Am I just imagining all of this or wtf is going on? Is a big ""FUCK YOU"" written on my forehead or what? I don't think it's because I am ugly, I mean how often do you walk by ugly people when you are with your friends or with your partner and how often do you tell them about that ugly person? It doesn't happen right? Unless there is something extremely strange going on. But come on, we're all just normal people trying to live our lives. I wanna believe I am imagining all of this but sometimes it's so obvious that I just know it's not my imagination. I think that I might just look fascinating. Another weird thing is that I usually get approached a lot by strangers asking for help. I look quite approachable in public I guess, so it can't bee that I look scary right? Anyone else who have been through something similar? Sometimes I just wish I had the balls to walk up to the people when this happens and ask them ""Can you tell me what's wrong with me? Why are you talking about me?"" Sigh..."
e7ow5d8," There are no active compounts in Lavender oil that will directly impact your physiology (other than to possibly low-key poison you). It's already a bad idea to directly apply essential oils directly to your skin in anything but small amounts since it can irritate your skin, they should \*absolutely never\* be ingested unless so dilute it's basically not there anymore. &amp;#x200B; The 'active ingredient' is listed as just 'lavender extract', which doesn't describe anything beside 'we squished a plant and assume it has stuff in it that'll actually do something'. That's not what an 'active ingredient' is supposed to be. This sort of capsule is pure placebo. The reason essential oils are nice is because pleasant stimuli (soothing pleasant scents, nice flavours, quiet and secure and warm rooms, soft touches) help you reduce your stress levels. Petting a purring cat because it's warm and soft and friendly is the aspect that is nice, you wouldn't eat a fluffy cat to try and help you settle down. In the same way ingesting stuff that smells nice makes no sense, and in this case it'll at best do nothing, at worst it might make you ill. &amp;#x200B; This type of product is the result of two things: people feeling bad are easy to sell shit to if you tell them it'll make them feel better, plus our long cultural history of creating elaborate placebo-like stories around things in our environment that are pleasant. &amp;#x200B; It's perfectly fine to use pleasant things like music, pretty images, comfortable clothes and sheets, nice smells to make yourself comfortable. But try to remember that that's the only point (even if it's an important one that you're allowed to use as much as you like), and there is no 'medicine' behind this. &amp;#x200B; In terms of soothing your nervous system, there are far more effective ways than taking a pill that does nothing aside from making you mistakenly believe you're going to feel better because of it. The belief is what makes you feel better, not the pill, so might as well spend your money and time on something that does more than tell you a story. &amp;#x200B; Exercise is the big dead horse, but muscles in motion really do send compounds into your blood stream that reduce stress hormones. If you have people you like, give'em a hug, oxytocin is a great tension reliever. Try massages if you think that's something you'd like. Pick up mental coping skills like CBT and ACT, as your own thoughts can generate and perpetualise stress and tension. Sleep enough, and if you have trouble sleeping, look into ways to sleep better. Sleep restores and heals your body, and even low grade lack of sleep makes people less stress and pain tolerant. If you sleep too much, try to sleep more consistent times and wake up at a time that works for you. I could go on with things like this, there's a bunch of things you can look at and make small gradual changes to in order to lessen your day to day tension levels. Each of those will have a real effect, rather than making you pay for what comes down to a sugar pill. "
4vpgmt,"After the fact anxiety is making me the most boring person ever?. Hi, So I'm trying to confront a type of anxiety I've been dealing with for basically my whole life. See, after I do something nerve wracking, I get hit with crippling anxiety. And by after, I mean the next day. I remember even in 6th grade, after I'd go to a school dance I would wake up the next morning and feel nauseous and nervous. I didn't really think much of it though, I just kind of accepted it as a part of me and I figured everyone else experienced it too (only around two years ago at age 17 did I realize that ALOT of my experiences were abnormal). In high school too, I stopped going to dances after freshman year because I just dreaded how I would feel the weekend AFTER the dance. Weird right? Then I remember last year, right before college started, I went to my first party with alcohol and I honestly had a great time, as I usually do at events, but the day after was HORRIBLE. And nope, I wasn't hungover. I just hated myself and ruminated all day and cried and made myself sick because of anxiety, not even because I drank too much. Same thing with yesterday. I was on a cruise and I went out for a few drinks with my cousin and sister. I was a little nervous because my sister didn't know I drank and I wanted to keep it that way, but nonetheless I had a really good time! But now I feel AWFUL. I'm back home and have been shut up in my room all day just pacing around and rapidly searching the internet to soothe my anxiety. Its awful. Honestly a few days ago I was thinking about how this had been the best summer I had in a while because I hadn't done anything eventful, just read a lot of books, so I hadn't had any anxiety spins! I honestly love going out and am a fun person when I do, but the way I feel afterwards makes it not worth it! I feel like I'm going to develop cardiovascular issues, my heart has been beating fast like all day! Can anyone relate to this?! I honestly feel so sick right now. Any advice? Ugh, I'm 19 and I feel like I can't go out!"
ejd3t9i, Yeah i hate that were supposed to be social animals. It sucks depending on people and then having then leave you forever. Theirs alot of solitary animals on earth that a always happy to be left alone. Most of the time I'm happy on my own But there's always that empty feeling that comes around and that's only there because we're supposed to be with other people. I would love to live on farm with horses and other livestock animals and go months without even seeing a person out in the deep country 
dek1ldr," Yeah, I was alway the ""shy quiet one"" as a kid. My parents would always have to force me a bit to play in the playground, but I also didn't have much trouble making friends when I eventually forced myself to join in. After high school though, it all went to shit and I've learnt a lot about myself. "
70qjhd," A big source of my SA is... When someone asks ""what do you like to do for fun?"" or ""tell me about yourself?"" I don't really have that much trouble meeting new people in the normal ways of introducing myself, saying my name, where I'm from, smiling and being nice etc. the trouble starts to come when people start asking these questions. I feel like I'm so boring. Everyone else always has these super interesting hobbies/talents/stories to tell about themselves and that's not the case for me. I never really fully formed hobbies outside of reading/writing growing up, so when someone asks what my hobbies are sometimes I literally lie and make something up. Last time someone asked this I could tell what kind of answer they were expecting so I lied and said I played tennis. Even though I only played for like a year and a half in high school. Lol. Because the truth is a lot of people don't think reading/writing/going to concerts/stuff like that are hobbies. They think hobbies=sports. Also, when someone's like, ""tell me about yourself!"" I'm like, wracking my brain to think of something interesting. Why do extroverts (it's usually extroverts, let's be honest) ask questions like that right off the bat of meeting someone? Anything interesting I might have about myself I'm not going to reveal to a near stranger. So I usually just say my name, age, where I'm from, what I'm studying (I'm a college student.) This line of questioning really makes me nervous to meet new people &amp; go to club meetings, not actually meeting new people. I like making new friends, but I like revealing information about myself slowly. Anyone else relate? "
ewgam85," Yeh, actual exposure to the situations that induce anxiety is so important. Sometimes being thrown in to the deep end of the pool does force us to learn how to swim. I did come to the same realisation as you myself but it wasn't as dramatic. The knowledge that anxiety has an illusory nature and that it is generated from within can be quite liberating. "
jq0xa2,"First “job” as a dog walker/sitter for someone, we agreed to payment at the end of the week but I haven’t heard from the guy. Got bad anxiety over it.

I’m walking/watching this guys dog m-f while he’s at work and we agreed to payment in cash on Friday every week. Now it’s Saturday, almost evening, and I haven’t heard from him. I want to contact him but I worry that I’ll come across as rude or rushing or something, and then he’ll drop me, but at the same time what if he’s waiting for me to contact him first?? Should I just wait? Or should I say something? I feel stupid asking this question like there should be some sort of common sense answer but I really have no idea what to do!"
eicz1x4,Idk man I really wish that some teachers would have more understanding in the situation. It would be good if they gave us the chance to do the presentation just infront of the teacher so that it gives us a bit of anxiety but not infront of all students thats like saying ok you have to jump of a 40 meter cliff in the ocean it's too much
drdui1y,"There's a girl who has always been intimating to me at work for a year and a half. She's got the cutest smile, dresses really well, and she's so cool. Whenever I used to bump into her I would freeze up and pretend to be busy. So for about a year I never spoke a single word to her. But for the last several month I started to really work on myself. I started to go out every weekend by myself. I would go hiking, watch movies, try new restaurants, and other activities. Basically like setting up nice dates for myself. Over time, I was able to smile at her and say hi, and she would do the same. Eventually, we were able to do small talk. And it seems like she's really happy whenever we ran into each other. She would make comments or laugh. I don't think I'll ever be able to date her but this is tremendous progress for me and I believe you can do it too!"
ioalgq,"Trying to make progress (vent).  and#x200B; So I've tried a lot to come out of my shell the past few months. People like Jordan Peterson really inspired me to get out there and do the best I can even though I won't do it perfectly, and that there's more to me than I think. I got a job after not working for over a year, which is an upgrade (even though I'm just a package handler). I've gotten more serious about running and working out and have made decent progress there. I've never had many hobbies other than video games so I've been trying to expand that a bit. I've started training Jiu Jitsu and I try to go at least a few times a week. This is very challenging socially, and I still feel like a total outcast when I'm there, but I'm just trying to keep showing up. I've done a bit of climbing also and want to get more into that when the gyms start opening up again. The largest thing I've done is I completed a wilderness first-responder training course where I lived with 30 total strangers for 9 days. I've definitely had a handful of successful interactions during these activities but I still beat myself up regardless. I think things like ""This person is younger than me and they're so much more confident"" and ""They're so outgoing and really seem like they have their shit together"" and shit like that. Even though I feel awkward sometimes in the moment, that's nothing compared to the negative self talk I go through later. I have my first therapy session on Thursday so I'm gonna give that a shot. I'm just tired of being the quiet one and my only goal is to feel good about myself. Even though I'm struggling and don't feel that great about myself I know for a fact that I'm far braver than I was last year when I was basically a recluse. I still have a long way to go, but at least I'm on a path now."
f3bfzoc, Exactly. I never even really got to use all these apps properly because as the name social media suggest you need friends. Not that I miss it though. Couldn't give a fuck what their meals look like. Neither am I interested in seeing anyone pose at the beach. 
8hgvhf," I couldn’t bring myself to hang out with my coworker and her friends today even though I really wanted to because I’m too nervous around strangers. So I have this coworker who is really sweet. I love talking to her at work and we get along really well. She invited me to go out on her boyfriend’s boat today and I was really excited and flattered that she asked me to join, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it because I felt too intimidated to be trapped on a boat with a bunch of strangers (except for her) with no way to escape if things got awkward. I was especially intimidated because she is insanely attractive, so I assume her friends are too, and I am as plain as they come. I know it’s irrational, but I get super intimidated by beautiful people. I just feel very inadequate around them. Anyway, she sounded kinda pissed that I rejected her invitation, so I hope I didn’t blow it. I hate that I may have offended her, I just couldn’t bring myself to do it as I am extremely introverted and this was a last minute thing (I need a ridiculous amount of time to prepare for social events where I won’t know many people). I’m definitely going to talk to her at work tomorrow and hopefully everything will be good. Wish me luck! "
ez9j7hy," Yo I really liked this girl in my youth group for a really long time and we went to the same camp for a week, I was working up my courage for months and decided that I would confess on the last day, but I was too late and she got a boyfriend. I cried myself to sleep that night "
eqj2k9z," Yeah it’s definitely better than staying at home, I’ll give you that. Do you not ever feel like exercising feels like anxiety symptoms? For example, the racing heart and heavy breathing? I managed to force myself out the other week just for a bike ride and the feeling he felt almost identical. It’s one reason I’m tempted to take it up - so I can trick myself into thinking it’s just like exercise when I’m anxious "
dhyco6v," ""break"" is a matter of interpretation, you don't break if you don't care for their games. this is the approach if you wan't to be under the radar and take the path of least resistance. but if you seek something other, then you've gotta practice assertiveness, and be willing to rock the boat "
g9nuz6," I forced myself to be in a group and I don't like it anymore. Before quarantine, in school, I used to be with a group of people in the playground just for not being left alone. I didn't talk at all but most of them didn't seem to care(it was a big group, like 20 people) I used to see this little group talking at the distance, they were 3 persons, one of them I knew a lot and we talked a lot in class. I really wanted to be with them because they seemed super nice, but now that I'm on the group I don't like what I got myself into. They're stupid. The only thing they know to do is do stupid dark jokes and laugh about absolutely everything anyone says. I want to leave, but I know if I leave I am going to be left alone again. I'm changing schools next year so that's fine but if we come back to school before the school year ends, I don't know what I'm going to do. "
eyv7tb,"If it wasn't for this issue, this is what I'd love to be doing. Always been a fan of sports, and have a talent for football. I'd love to be able to play football everyday with people i enjoy to be with. I'd love to learn how to skate (I used to as a kid), id love to learn to play guitar, I'd love to have friends that like me for who I am and want me around. A girlfriend that I love and loves me back. Stable job with people I have a good relationship with. Doesn't even have to be an high paying job. I want to leave a temporary job knowing that I made good friendships, and knowing that i'll come home to other people who love me so I don't need to feel alone. I am 24, I had potential, but Im wasting it all because I pretty much don't know how to interact with other people in a personal level. I always feel inferior bro everyone.. I know this isn't me. How am I going to practice social skills that I don't have anybody to be with?"
mesg57,20f I hung out with my guy friend’s group and I was quiet and awkward the whole time. Should I hang out with them again?. A close friend of mine invited me to hang out with his friends at this bonfire party. I decided to go and my plan was to just smoke and chill. I got so high that I wasn’t even paying attention to what they were saying and if they asked me anything I wasn’t able to respond what I wanted to say or I just stayed quiet. I feel like I made a bad first impression and I feel his friends think I’m weird/lame. My friend invited me again tonight to hang out with the group at our own bonfire. But I said I’m gonna pass because I feel like his friends wouldn’t want me there. Or I’ll just ruin the night. It’s hard to talk to people and make convos when you struggle with social anxiety and the weed made it worse. I’m trying to be more social but I don’t think I meant to make friends Anyways did I make the right decision of not going to their bonfire meet-up?
cvpvbyh,"Therapy is seriously changing my life. I used to be basically unable to leave my house except to go to class or go for a run in the middle of the night so people wouldn't see me. After about a year in therapy, I was able to walk up to a girl at school today and ask her out, and I did it with very little fear. It's really worth it man, go out there and live your life. "

I go to this skatepark most days and there's this group of people that I want to introduce myself too, they all seem like cool people but I have no idea what to go up and say to these people. I say hi to one of those people everyday when I get there but it hasn't gone further than that yet. &amp;#x200B; If anyone has any tips or can help I would appreciate it so much, this feeling of loneliness is starting to settle in and its made it a hard few months.

abz2bi," I need some tips to improve my social skills.. Hey Reddit! I'm a 13 year old male, and I am not very good at socializing. It is a problem that affects many people, and well...me included! So here I am. So, I am in a basketball team. Where we need to develop a healthy relation with our teammates. Sadly, such thing is not an easy task for people like me. I've been playing for 2 years, and honestly, I don't feel a strong friendship with any of the people in my team. Obviously, it affects my performance in the games and trainings. I love to socialize, I'm all for socializing. But sadly, I am not an expert at it - pretty much the opposite. This doesn't apply only to my basketball team, of course - I have a similar problem at school. But it doesn't really matter where are we focusing. It is the same question I'm making for both cases. Do you guys have any tips to make me better at socializing? TL;DR - I am not good at socializing, that affects me and I want to improve my life by getting better at socializing. Do you guys have any tips for me? "
658849," Best way to ask someone on ""first"" date?. Alright so my friend and I skate downtown and get coffee at this little local coffee place every single day. Recently this super cute girl started working there (or maybe she has been for a while but since we started going more I've noticed now). We went once, saw her, left and I jokingly called dibs on her to my friend (if HIMYM has taught me anything, it's that calling dibs is final). The next time she was there, she was teaching a new person the ropes and she looked at me as I was paying and asked if anyone has told me I look like Shia Lebouf (I do), I went to say no, realized they have (frequently), and said yeah. Laughed. Got coffee, left. Went back later (caffeine is all thats getting me through my final semester) and she went ""hey Shia is back! I'm sorry that's kind of rude, but I don't know​ your name so.."" I said ""My name is nothankyou94, what's yours?"" Got her name, got my coffee. She goes to fill an empty pot, and I say ""Wait. I look like Shia Lebouf? Is that a good or bad thing. Like should I take it as a compliment or insult?"" ""Well, I'd say a good thing. He seems like a cool guy."" Laugh and go about our business. Next time we go was just a ""hey how's it going today?"" I know it doesn't sound like a big deal, but the fact I actually talked to someone I dont know, and a cute girl at that, is really weird. About to graduate college and have made 1 friend, who was my best friend's dorm-mate. I talk to no one. Getting in the car after the Shia Lebouf thing my friend goes "" Wow, you talked to stranger, I'm so proud."" What's also weird is that I have this big of a crush. Its not like me and doesn't happen frequently, if at all. But she's super cute, seems fun, and is clearly funny. Ive been sort of trying to build myself up to ask her out, to the point where for the last few days when we go to get coffee I'm anticipating the words to use to ask her out, and expecting to actually do it, but she hasn't been on the last few days. So now I've gotten all up in my head about it. So what do I say? I had planned on getting coffee, then if no one's in line just say "" Hey, do you want to go out sometime? Y'know, dinner, movie, whatever people normally do on a first date?"" I've only ever been on one serious first date and it was to an amusement park, and that was through Tinder. And since I'm socially awkward and anxious, I dont even know if it's socially acceptable to just blatantly ask someone out like that. Also should I drop the second line? I thought it would add a little bit of humor while also sort of getting the point I'm not super-experienced at the dating thing across. But the more I think about it the more I'm not sure. Any tips or advice would be just nifty. "
cyfl1f2,"Sunny day? Go outside for 15 minutes or more. Try excersising too somehow. Start jogging or go to gym. All the things I mentioned can raise mental clarity.nnAlso, my psychologist told me I should start learning how to cook. I was unsure I would ever start doing it, but I relayed the idea to my mom and she gave me an easy recipe, and we planned I would make the dinner every Thursday. To my joy, it really did give me that extra bit of self-worth.nnRemember that it's all small steps though, and appreciate it with every little inch you move :)nnIf getting out of your room is hard for you, try doing inside physical exercise. Push ups, stretching, yoga etc."
cxfynb0," You're lucky! Public transport is pretty reliable where I'm from (Melbourne Australia), but now I'm living in the San Francisco Bay Area and it's nowhere near as good. "
ejcdpbw," I think it's more to do with personality than looks. Maybe ur coming off as egotistical or the people on those dating sites are just looking for a ""fun"" time. I don't really like online dating. I've had a few myself and trust me when I say they are not bf material. I think you first need to establish a common ground. Maybe go out alone to the park or Ur college library or some place that you think has potential to meet someone new. Not to be mean but you might be coming off as desperate to some people or over eager. Observe how people u think are less attractive act around others. Anyways you seem like a great person so just be confident and be u. Everyone gravitates towards genuinely nice and happy people in some way or the other. "
f2wv7c2,"Well I have given countless presentations, among my group I'd say I was the one who I actually took the initiative. I have a naturally loud voice that echoes so my presentations were always clear and direct. The only minor issues I noticed is that sometimes I would try to say something quickly and end up slurring my words, but its rare though. And one time I noticed my hands were shaking and a couple of girls in the back were giggling about it but it was no big deal cuz they ended up bombing their presentations. But overall I say I do pretty good. Apart from that I joined a society, took part in some event managements (though whether I wanted to be there and how comfortable I was is another thing entirely). Went to meetings and all that crap. Hung out with friends, occasionally went out on my own bike which was absolutely dreadful for me but pushed through it. Went to concerts etc. One of the few things I really enjoy, just hanging out with friends. Never really had any luck with girls though but its part of our culture so there's that. Been at it for 3 years now. But the absolute feeling of dread, terror (sweating, sometimes shaking and heart about to burst in the chest, feeling like throwing up) never went away and are out of my control. Along with the lingering thoughts that last for weeks/months. I manage to keep a calm on the outside but the physical symptoms alone deter me. So I only do these things when I absolutely have to and to them reasonably well, otherwise there is NO FUCKING WAY AND NO ONE CAN FORCE ME TO."
erv8k30,"21 here have not held a job yet. I have had 2 interviews already but I turned down my latest job offer. 6 months ago I didnt know what to do with myself, but I decided to write down a list of things I hope to accomplish for the year 2019. Here are just a few: - Hang out with a friend - Get a job - With money earned, get a gym membership. So far after six months I have completed the first one. Couple days back I had the courage to call up an old friend back from 10th grade. We hadnt seen each other in 4 years so we ended up catching Godzilla together. It wasnt the ideal setting for catching up but we stay in contact now and have other plans for the summer! (4th of July, camping up in the mountains) Job. Like I said I almost had one but turned it down, it was a courtesy clerk position. I didnt feel like it was the right fit for me so today I have already bookmarked some new jobs and I'll be applying. One tip I've learned when hunting for entry level jobs is dont simply apply online and expect a phone call. Apply online, go in, meet the manager, and drop off your resume. This will bypass something called an ATS system which is used online to filter resumes before they get sent to the recruiter. Just have hope! But before you have hope, you must have a vision. We as humans naturally want to have things in our lives. Figure out what it is for you, break down your vision into goals that can help you get closer to that vision. You got this!"
doa6p01," I really want to give you some helpful and useful comments, not only because I think there needs to be more people like you on this planet helping out those who need it but also because I know what it's like to be like your friend and if it were the other way around I'd like for someone to give helpful and useful comments. Firstly, what is it like to have social anxiety - I guess it's like everyone around you is closely watching you waiting for the slightest little thing they can notice to negatively judge you about or to use to embarrass you. It's essentially a fear of being viewed negatively and/or embarrassed. It makes you paranoid and overanalyze everything from the way you look to how you're standing to what you're doing with your hands, feet, face etc to how you sound when you speak, you think you're coming across nervous and unsure of what you're saying, every millisecond of silence is torture because you're racking your mind trying to think of something to say but you don't know what to say, you convince yourself everything you think of is boring or stupid or you will be negatively judged about it, you're always constantly thinking about what is this person thinking about, for every millisecond they're not speaking you believe that they're thinking about how boring you are, how they wish you were more confident and how they wish they could tell you that it's not going to kill you to talk a little more but they know that would only make you less talkative. It's like your mind is going so fast that you can't keep up with all your thoughts and what is actually going on irl like the current conversation or whatever, you then fear you're coming across slow or stupid because you're thinking about so much that your response to what's happening irl is slightly delayed. Do you know what I mean. I don't think I've explained this well. I think if you want for him to meet new people, the best way is to probably casually invite him along to something with you and one or two maybe three others. Don't make it out to be a big thing. Don't pressure him to do anything he doesn't want to. Keep it casual, relaxed. If at all possible invite people who you know have similar interests to him so they can find common ground. Try to include him in conversation if you don't think he is inputting anything but do it in a way that's no putting all of the focus on him. I think if you guys usually hang out doing activities, that's probably better than just sitting in a restaurant or bar as there is more pressure on the conversation in a restaurant or a bar where you are sat facing each other the whole time. If you do an activity like bowling or glow in the dark mini /crazy golf or something it might be less intimidating. I think if you ask him to hang out and ask him what he wants to do, and then say something like do you mind if I bring a couple of friends and introduce him to them. I don't think I'm making sense anymore, I hope you succeed with helping him make new friends. "

jgqfg1,Any advice?. I (M20’s) had SA for the past 4 years and went through CBT therapy twice with different psychologists. I understand the problem and that I need to be exposed but now with lockdown and the fact I study online/work freelance I’m lost as to where I could go. If I force myself outside I feel 50% less anxious by the end of the day but the next morning it resets and it feels like a complete waste of time. Could you suggest something I could do? I considered volunteering but I can’t beat the feeling of it being a waste of time since I wouldn’t improve. Sorry if this got too long
oaxnwk,"My story on how I became socially anxious (18 M) , Do you relate?. I wasn't meant to be like that , That went really wrong , I wonder if it were the choices I made that got me in this place I was a quite social boy , not too much of an introvert , I actually enjoyed time with other people more than I did alone... (doesn't mean that I didn't need time to reflect) and for some reason people appreciated me , but after that things became different , I always had a really quiet voice , I guess it was linked to unconscious anxiety (which is ironic considering my previous statement) my mother was so over protective , she was also an introvert and she was REALLY PROTECTIVE , we also live in countryside , there are a lot of people in this place but our neighbors are actually relatives , so I spent more time playing with the neighbors kids rather than meeting new people , they were nice , sometimes they acted total dicks , but most of the time they were really welcoming and nice but my mother only would let us (me and my brothers) go outside for 1 hour and then come back home to either study or play with our same old toys or watch the tv (which had nothing interesting in it) or just stare at wall until the day ends As my dad spends most the day in work with very little income , and my mom with her overprotection I became less confident about myself even with people close to me , another thing is that we didn't socialize a lot , years could pass and we didn't go in a family picnic or do an activity as a family... it even made me more detached that I kind of got the ""Avoidant"" attachment style Fun fact ! : I live in a religion based country , that means that the majority of people values religion and traditions too much , and living in the countryside only makes it worse when most of these traditions makes no sense to me (sometimes I think I'm the only one who really judges these tradition) Anyway back to the topic ,do you know that kind of people who don't care about their appearance? those were my parents , they didn't teach me to take care of my appearance nor how to do hygiene , I did take showers and make sure not to smell bad , but that wasn't enough , I still have problems in taking care of myself like going to the barber to cut my hair or even small things like cutting my finger nails! , it was madness , not until I became 16 , yes 16 until I realized there was something wrong in my family every time people laugh at me or COMPLETELY IGNORES ME because of my quiet voice or lame hair , it only comes to my mind how my family wasn't educated enough to know how to live in this world or to know how to take care of a child , if you are not good enough to take care of children then don't make four of them and call them a failure for something that is completely YOUR FAULT , well not completely , a part of the problem is also me for not working much of myself. and here I am now , I am a smart boy with good memory , I have always used to get good grades on tests even without proper studying , especially in math or English , My tests are a month from now and this is my ticket way to go to college , since college is free and it's seemingly impossible to get a job in my country , so college is my only way to live a better life , but I'm a little anxious since college is going to have girls too (schools in my country are either completely for boys or completely for girls) and I have little experience with the other gender I can't even look at a girl so I wish you who are reading the comment a nice day (just wishing a nice day let's not get weird about it lol jk)."
hoii1s," Just had a tense walk to my house after work. (Dying inside) ☠️ Rant. Just got off of work minutes ago, I take uber and normally it’s easy to communicate with drivers and get to where I’m going. I prefer foreigners because of the culture and language barrier, (I’m American) but this time it went horribly wrong... 😥 I live on a busy ass street in the projects, it’s rough, butttt manageable. Often times I politely ask my driver to pull a U-Turn to my side of the street or find another place to come back round. Usually, they are cool with it, but with this guy I think communication failed. I’m respectful and friendly, and tip from time to time. The perfect storm was set tonight because one, I might of had my co-worker passive aggressively say he’d snitch on me for taking it easy in the last few minutes of work. Two my block is usually quiet at night, everyone inside, just the occasional sirens and cars with music.. you know the usual. But not tonight because one of my neighbors was outside talking to someone in the road with their 4 ways on. My mind was already racing coming around the corner hoping I can just slide by them by asking my uber driver to go in front of the car a couple cars down. But nope, the dude just stopped directly behind the car making it awkward a’f! People out here gossip, A LOT, that’s a bit of paranoia on my end and facts on the other. I had a mask on and my AirPods in, so maybe he didn’t understand me due to that. I said “on the other side of the street in front of that car with their blinkers on.” Probably came out muffled as all hell, he said “ok” so I thought I was good. After exiting the vehicle I let my composure slip and mutter “dumb ass mf” I still gave him 5 stars lol, it was easily my anxiety getting to me, I’m not high maintenance. Either way I came out feeling like a weirdo because some of my neighbors deadass just watch other people’s routine and project whatever story they like on them. I was calm on the inside, and walked past em, but god I knew they were probably saying something that’ll keep me up tonight. Like one time before this one scrub talked crap about me being dirty because “I wear my slides (sandals) everyday” Boyyyyy, I change into shorts and a tank top after work because I work hard in a warehouse. My feet need relief! Plus, he had on a oversized GAP shirt with a dusty fitted baseball cap. Sitting on the porch all day broke as hell. 🙄 Alas, I had my AirPods in so he probably thought I couldn’t hear him. I was to tired and prayed on my off days if i ran into him again and if he pulled the same stunt I’d come after his neck, whether that be passive-aggressively or just simple kindness and class. But it’s risky, because people get violent quick (Me to) and it’s not worth dying fighting over petty ass shit. Summary, bad communication leads to awkward outcomes, thank god I’m off tomorrow. Time to recharge 🔋 "
dtfm42s,"I went through the exact same thing last year. I was terrified of going outside because of panic attacks. I thought if I wasn't at home I wasn't safe from them. I was diagnosed with panic disorder and my therapist suggested I go outside for timed periods. So go for a walk for five minutes, then come home. Then ten minutes another day, then come home.  I'm not going to lie, I didn't always do this ""homework"" she set for me but it did help just getting out more. She also told me to ride out panic attacks instead of seeking comfort and coping techniques. My coping was reaching for my phone as a distraction or gulping down water from a bottle I couldn't leave the house without or fleeing from the room/building/environment I was in . If you feel panic coming on just stay where you are and let your body feel it and accept it. It's really hard  I know. But once you let yourself feel it, you'll then feel yourself come out of it absolutely fine and alive. My biggest issue was relying on coping techniques. I wouldn't leave the house without a water bottle or rescue remedy. Some days I do feel anxiety about going outside but I honestly don't know where I would be without my old therapists advice. I really recommend talking to someone about it and seeking help. "
ezuky49," Let's assume for a second that you're right it and you could easily have just looked it up online. Let's assume this act was stupid. Now why does that make you an idiot? You are many things. I'll call you John. There's John the student. John the worker. John the gamer. John the film watcher. John the friend. John the socializer. John the photographer. John the cook. John the tennis player. John the runner. There are thousands of different selves. Also the ""selves"" are constantly changing. I.e. John the tennis player of the future can be very different from John the tennis player today. Think that I = iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii Now we'll say John the job socializer (i) performed badly at this instance by asking an obvious question. That does not mean that all the other i's or John are also doing badly. The question is what can John the socializer (i) do better next time. &amp;#x200B; Just another point though, what you did was not even idiotic lol. So the fuck what if you ask them in person? That's allowed. There is no reason why you can't ask that. Of course those people may in their heads think that you are idiot i.e. in all situations of life but as the above argument illustrates you are not. So you need not give a fuck about what is occuring in their heads about you as a whole person. "
kf5vtr,"Just Had A Successful First Date Today :D. So i ran out of anxiety medication last week including propranolol which i use in very anxious situations like presentations, calling new people, or meeting new people especially if it's a date. But i had nothing. Which itself made me more anxious. Going in, feeling very exposed. We have called twice 3 and 4 days ago. The first time for 4 hours and the second for an hour. We had also tried to meet twice but she had cancelled through no fault of her own. Just shit happens. But today she was ready, me not so much haha. I picked her up at like 10:30 am and i dropped her home at 6pm. We had lunch and dinner together which was super fun. She's super chatty which helps me a lot. I find it hard to start talking i guess. We had a few periods of silence, never long like a minute or 2 kinda thing. And although silence doesnt bother me as i dont feel the need to talk constantly. I guess i was anxious that she though it was awkward and thought i didn't talk enough. But she said I was fine. I mean we seem to have already arranged a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th date haha. Which is fine by me I like her and i guess it shows she likes me (and that she has told me). We walked by the lakes, the first one we went to is the one in star wars episode 7 that maz kanatas castle is on, if any of yall have seen that. It was nice and it's a nice view. Also it rained a lot and i got soaked and looked like a drowned rat, and that didn't even put her off so tht was good. :D we went to this cool cave that has a like a pond inside and stepping stones going across we went there and held hands a bit on the walk which was nice. I suck at reading social cues and i hate it. We texted after i dropped her home and got home myself, she said that I'm a wonderful human lol i said to her i dont know about you but i like holding your hand. She said she liked it too and kept trying to get me to hold her hand more. But i guess I was too dumb to notice 😂. But now I know she liked it so that's good. Hopefully we will see each other again on sunday I hope. 😁"
5kjmmq," im the most awkward person and im ok with it.... i'm starting to enjoy being by myself and accepting myself for who i am... an awkward mfker and i'd like to think that it's a step into the right direction. I thought christmas was gonna be a drainer like any other year where i was depressed and look at everyone else's lives on fb. But to my surprise, I acutally enjoyed it. I spent some time outdoors with family and I loved not thinking about other people but myself and just enjoyed the scenery. I used to be jealous of other's social skills and their lives. I would try to copy them, impress them and try to reply like them. of course that did not work. Anyone can relate? "
pwx6yt,"i'm 14 and my psychiatric prescribed Prozac (fluoxetine) to me. I don't know how to feel about this. I guess I'm scared and relieved at the same time? Relieved because I've been dealing with these social problems since I was like 10. I'm going to try to summarize what my social anxiety has been like. (english is not my native language so i'm sorry for the mistakes and bad grammar.) I have always been a calm, quiet girl, but I think it all started when I had an early puberty for my age. I had a lot of acne on my forehead so kids kinda bullied me at school, even teachers always asked me if i had an allergy or something, because it's not normal to have acne at 10! Since then I started to hate school and to be extremely self-conscious about myself. I was very ashamed of my acne and hated when people looked at me, because I thought they were looking at my forehead. I started to feel very uncomfortable when people looked at me, my face turned red and I looked away, I avoided talking to people so that they would not see my forehead. I even once cut bangs and used my mom's makeup to hide the pimples but it just got worse. Although now at 14 I no longer have acne (thanks to taking isotretinoin) that just marked me a lot and now I am not the same. I had a friend but she moved to another city, and now I literally have no friends. So the pandemic was the best thing that happened to me (even tho at first i skipped zoom classes because i was scared of having to turn on the camera so I always pretended I had connection problems, and when we did breakout rooms i just left the meeting). I enjoyed the time locked up a lot but the consequences of not interacting with anyone directly, literally NO ONE of my age during almost two years were very bad. I recently went back to school and it's hell for me. Every morning I feel a strong pain in my stomach from nerves, and when I'm in the class it's horrible because I feel like everyone is looking at me, judging me. And the worst thing is that a few days later this boy (who bullied me before the pandemic) came and asked me if i was mute. He calls me ''antisocial'' when he sees me. Those comments like: -Are you dumb? Why do you never speak? Do you not like me? Do you have autism or something? really annoys and hurt me. There is a girl I kinda know and I have lunch with her just to not eat alone, but when we leave the cafeteria it's very uncomfortable because I stay there standing like a stupid without saying anything, and that makes me hate myself, I always think: -why can't i act normal and just have a properly conversation? It's supposed to be easy.- I can't integrate myself into the conversation with her other friends and my voice is always hoarse when i try to say something (trust me, i've tried hard) , so now I go to the bathroom. What I used to do was to go to the library during break but now I can't go because of the covid it's closed so I don't have a choice. I'm scared of staying outside and reading a book, because everyone sits down with their group of friends in a circle and i feel like they judge me when they see me alone (i've tried it but i just cant focus reading.) and surely that boy will come and tell me antisocial and all bullshit. Going to school to me is like, as soon as I walk in, I become a totally different person. I can't express emotions or speak for fear of how people will react, even when I write or eat i feel extremely uncomfortabable because I do not know where to look at, what facial expression to do (some people have told me i look angry) I can't look anyone in the eye, and obviously in class i never participate (Group work sucks because I say anything, I feel like I worry too much about others that I forget to think and I can't say things assertively or opine, so they think I'm mediocre or something, that I don't want to work.) My mom already knew about this and just said that it was because of my age, because I am a teenager, that my sister was the same and that it was going to pass quickly. But now that it has gotten worse she took me to the psychologist, at first I didn't tell the doctor what I had been feeling but then I was able to tell her most of it. My mother also took me to a psychiatrist to have a presential appointment (because my psychologist does not live in my city) and after some sessions she formulated this Prozac medication for me. My mom was surprised, because I feel like she still thinks I'm just shy and that's it, and she was against me taking medicine. She doesn't want me to be dependent of a medicine and she says that i just have to talk more because that's what humans do, communicate with others, and that my future is going to be hard if i continue like this. I think my dad doesn't even know I go to the psychologist. But recently my mom has been supportive, I know she just wants to help me. Already started taking the medicine about two days ago, and I was kinda happy that she prescribed it to me because I hope it will help me along with the therapy. But I'm also worried because what if it doesn't work? I think it just helps with the symptoms because clearly I'm not going to be a social butterfly from night to day just by taking that, I know I have to do an effort to socialize. and also I've read about the side effects and stuff. Anyway, I know this is very long and probably no one is going to read it, I just wanted to vent by writing this. and if someone has taken this medication maybe you could share how you felt:)"
ejphdqz,Thats a bit like me but im 13 (so no bars lol) and im scared to play outside because peoole might judge my clothes or il embaras my self.
4pr48a," anxiety attack at a baseball game. i ordered some food for myself, and once i got my food, my friend was nowhere to be found. there i was in the middle of a huge crowd of people without my friend so i had to stand there awkwardly, in line with her parents.... then her dad walked off.. her mom didn't know where he went... so she made me split up away from her to find everyone... so i had to find my friend and her dad in this HUGE crowd of people. i was already feeling suffocated due to the fact that there were crowds of people all around me and this had made me feel even worse. she didn't even care or anything. she didn't think it was wrong. is that a right thing to do ? i felt like i was being stared at whenever i was trying to find everyone. it didn't help that i only had coffee to drink so i was very shaky and tense and sweaty. tears were welling up. i was feeling dissociated. the cashiers that i talked to had treated me weirdly.

pzycgc,"I need help, I dont know what to do.. I'm 16M living in France and I have only one good friend that I can talk to but we can only see each other for 1 month a year. It's been 1 years that I completely stopped going to school IRL and I dont have any social contact besides my sister and her friends. I feel lonely af but can't do much since whenever I go outside I want to puke so bad that I just cant think of anything else. I'm so affraid of what other people think that I just can't go out or else I'm just gonna get judge by everyone. I kinda want to have new friend s but I seem to be uninterested about everything ""new people"" tell me, they are so fkin boring to me. I dont get it, people my age are so boring that even if I could go outside I wouldn't talk to them. Please help me. I want to know how can I meet people without going to school and having no friends around? And how the fuck can I get interested in people??  and#x200B; Sorry about the bad english I think it's understandable, atleast I hope so. Thank you if u answer me."
g23v5a4,"I have this very much too. In high school I had a great group of friends but I really only saw them during school, at the time I just simply didn't really give visiting them outside of school much thought. At some point I kinda started considering doing that, but it was like really late (we were like 3-4 years into high school at that point) and in the meanwhile my friends have all been at each other's places, except for me. And I just felt really awkward about visiting them out of the blue, simply because I was so late at it and every time I was outside with them and encountered one of their parents they were all like ""hey x's dad/mom"" and I was like *uh, who's that?* and it would just be so cringy to suddenly show up at their homes like ""hey I'm their friend who's never bothered to visit, how are ya"". So yeah, eventually I just put the thought out of my mind entirely. Never really saw them again after high school either, outside of two small gatherings. Really regret all of this, every now and then I even have a dream where I have no social anxiety and just contact them and meet up again, but then I wake up and I'm just like ""bummer"". But at the same time, the last time I saw them (probably a few years ago by now) I definitely noticed that they were changing somewhat and while our interests weren't really shared in the first place, I noticed that we were moving even further apart in terms of lifestyle, interests, etc, so now I don't even know whether it's even worth to keep in touch in the first place. Don't have any friends nowadays, even."

That joke went home. 4h later I went out jogging then sent ""You made me take a run! Guess the milk wasnt enough after all' IT DIDNT GO HOME I JUST WANNA VANISH. He responded ""im lost, I dont get it"" and I feel like such a weirdo. Just responded ""aha idk either ^-^"" as I didnt want to ruin the joke Feels like I dragged out the joke too far.

dh8md3,"How do I get more involved with my friends?. Okay well I have these two online friends. We play games together all the time and they normally talk to one another in voice and ive never spoken. In fact I never speak invoice chat at all because I'm so awkward and im just scared. I feel more 'intelligent' typing because when I talk I stumble over words. Cant pronounce certain things or just forget words. And dont know what to talk about. Worry about how I sound. I had no real Mic for the longest of times but bought on this last summer telling myself I'm going to do it. I've listened in on my voice numerous times just to feel at ease at how I sound but still anxious. I keep on telling myself, okay today od the day I speak but something always happens to discourage me. Like today I was all prepared and then one of my friends had their new college friends I guess camping in their room, which is becoming a common occurence. Just adds to that anxiety of speaking up, so I ended up not doing anything. And then when they left it was too late at night to talk since my own roommate is sleeping..what should I do? How do I get over this hurdle. Also anxious about being overheard by roommate. My friends are pretty chill but I cant help but worry their opinions on me might change even if thats probably a dumb ridiculous worry. Oh also how do you even make friends in the real world if you dont go to school anymore and are super shy. Like how. I've lived here 5 years now and haven't made a single friend and its quite lonely..especially with online friends making new friends and not doing stuff with them as often as we did previously."
d2eqyi, First job interview. I (21m) have my first job interview tomorrow at a golf club bar. Never had a proper job as I’ve had pretty bad SA for a long time and I finished uni a few weeks ago. I’m very nervous but know this is what I need to do to improve. I’m worried I will be so anxious that I will screw simple tasks up or more likely I will dissociate (zone out) when people are talking to me (which happens a lot especially in the morning or after not having a good sleep). I also worry the others there will find me boring and hard to talk to. Any tips from people who’ve been in my situation? P.s I’m currently looking for a counsellor/psychologist to help me in my first few weeks on the job so hopefully that helps 
lx686w," How do I do life right.... I'm 25 M and am just realizing that I feel as though social anxiety, and difficulty in expressing myself, has been holding me back my whole life. This isn't an officially diagnoses but I've been diagnosed with depression and general anxiety in college, and through talking about it with a therapist and taking medication, we thought it was mostly due to unresolved trauma over a recently deceased close friend, a feeling of loneliness, and generally disliking the school and career choices I was making. Luckily I was able to come out of college with a degree and some options for the next steps in life, but at the same time I let tons of people down, such as people I was interning along side, class mates, and some friends who I couldn't even talk to in person before leaving school about what I was going through, and the most part I just vanished because I felt like the relationships I had with those people were toxic... I've luckily held onto some friends I made in classes, but even some of them are becoming more quiet lately. Fast forward to today, I'm living in a new city and married to a woman I love and who helped me get through those challenging times and who wanted to start doing life together. We have managed to keep our relationship stable through the pandemic, even with a few rough spots. I felt relieved to move to a new city and get away from my college and I thought making new friends would be easier, since I like to do outdoor things like go on hikes, which is popular here, and I usually like to talk to people. I feel like I've had many opportunities to make new friends and kinda made one through work, and feel like there have been many people I thought could make really good friends. Of the people I consider friends, they always talk about their other friends, and things they are doing together... even through this whole pandemic... and I get upset with myself because I don't have any other friends here, and I get sad because I like to do things that involve socializing like hiking, going on bike rides, or just hanging out, but I get so afraid to try and make new friends to do that stuff, and usually just do things alone. Several times I've tried to make new friends, usually because someone else introduced me, and I painfully initiated making plans, and maybe we've met up and done something outside once or a few times, but they eventually seem less interested in spending time together. Every time I've hung out with someone new, I thought things went well since I'm usually pretty happy go lucky and try to talk about stuff the other person wants to talk about... When I don't hear back from someone for a while, I just give up and try to forget about it. I just don't now what it is and the only thing I've been able to attribute it to is social anxiety. &amp;#x200B; When I think about how work-related relationships and friendships in my past have gone bad, and how it might be attributed to social anxiety, I can't help but feel that it's my fault. When I think about how I have conversations with people I feel like I have a hard time contributing new things, making the interaction interesting, or talking about what I think/want/need... I didn't even start to think about how conversations can be important and can help build relationships, until these past few years, and from a young age felt that it didn't really matter what I said, since I've always been called soft spoken and quiet. And now that I'm here, realizing that in being soft spoken and quiet, and in turn something of a loner, I feel like I self sabotaged most of the relationships in my life that could have helped me through hard times, and that maybe I was the one perpetuating what I thought were toxic relationships by not being able to express myself well and making other people annoyed at me, to which I, in the end, just walk away because it's too much for me to deal with... most of the times I write for myself to deal with my emotions and this is the first time writing to where other people might see this, because I feel like I'm in need of other people to talk to about this stuff, and idk help to figure out how to make friends... I'm generally freaked out to post anything online, but I feel like I have to get this off my chest somewhere, and I spend too much time on Reddit so it seems like a good place... TL;DR I'm going crazy because I feel like social anxiety is ruining my life. (generic I know) "
iwd5rx,"Tomorrow back to the office, after being away for a couple of months.... Hello,nnI've been doing an internship but have been away for a couple of months and got a full-time job there now.

dft0ri3," &gt; I just don't know how to ""meet"" new people: for example i'm starting to go out (alone ofc), at the park, commercial centre whatever is it. I'm just standing on a bench, or just standing looking at my phone......i end up to be bored and going home playing or doing stuff at the pc. This is a hilariously accurate description of my attempts to ""socialize."" God damn it. "
d649tf4," I was extremely lucky though and I met amazing peoples on the ""first try"". I have known them for nearly 2 years now (actually I started to go to that pub on august 8) and it took at least a year to have the courage to simply add some of them on Facebook. I was lucky a new girl (way more social than I was) suggested to add everyone while we were waiting for a game to start, which made it easy for me to add many more of them. From there I invited them on Facebook to an event the pub was doing outside (but that seriously lacked of marketing), some of them came and had fun, and then someone else suggested pool, and then bowling, etc... The great thing was that it was step by step, it never went too fast for me. I was able to deal with my anxiety little by little, learning to trust others, etc... I had some pretty rough down though and often I was doubting myself, the month of December was one of my worst for my anxiety and I had huge regret at that point in time but I persevered and I succeeded. "
eo6v8hq,"I feel you 😕 I would say get some hobbies, start exercising, biking, join a church, play rec sports, etc. Once you have stuff like this going on, it makes it easier to 1) meet people and 2) you can talk about the stuff you did. Also 3) with group related stuff it makes it easier since you are constantly around the same people, once you get to know them it’s not hard anymore Other people are just as “boring” as you think you are. It all starts with small bit of self-belief and to have stuff going on. When you think of the “non-boring” people, they make plans, have hobbies, are involved in groups, and talk about other memories / funny moments that they had. Don’t be so hard on yourself, you have to start somewhere, it’s not too late !!!🙂"
hko55x,"I don’t know what I am.. Hello reddit. I’ve never ever been diagnosed by a professional but I’m 100% sure I have a problem. I don’t know what it is. I’ve searched and researched throughout the years and they all lead to social anxiety or general anxiety. I’m 17 about to enter my senior year of high school. As a kid I had no problem making friends or having conversations even if I was a bit weird. I’ve had a pretty good/bad childhood. I know where my anxiety stems from. I hate shifting the blame towards him but my father was extremely diminishing when it came to me as a child. I played soccer. My dad would always compare me to others. He would call me useless, curse at me, in front of the other parents and kids. He would often scream at me for simple things like dropping a grain of rice on the floor and telling me to eat it from the floor. My mom and him fought a lot because my mom knew that what he was doing and she wanted him to stop. Just yesterday I went to soccer practice after 3 months of the virus and I couldn’t stop trembling. I could feel my heart in my chest beating really fast as we got closer to the field. Also I have a really close relationship with my mom because she’s never made me feel insecure about myself and she’s very pure and innocent in my eyes. I work part time in the company she’s worked in for 11 years and she’s just the most hardworking woman I’ve ever seen. Thank you Mom. Another thing to mention is that my dad is an alcoholic and his friends are too. They’re not the type of friends I would have. Think of the typical cocky fuck boys in HS. All that went on for years until I reached adolescence. He stopped criticizing me in sports, etc. But he would still get easily irritable with small things. Over the years our relationship got worse and worse. Especially his relationship with my mom. It all started 8th grade when I started becoming self conscious about myself. I’m also very skinny so I received a lot of body shaming growing up to the point where I don’t even care what my body looks like anymore. But I would recognize that the music I listened to, or things I did past or present were “cringy” and not something the crowd would do. I left middle school with 4.0 GPA and I was pretty committed to my grades. Anyways freshman year of hs wasn’t bad but I began to realize that I get scared of talking to people sometimes, and that I get easily irritated or mad over small things. Sophomore year was a hell hole. I became close friends with a girl I liked. She gave me a ton of mixed feelings and I ended up embarrassing myself because of it. A lot of guys in the city try to hit up on her. I saw her differently than everybody else though. I felt like I could be myself with her. But anyways we’re no longer friends. From then on it went downhill. I started to become self conscious about little things. It was like the more I started to think the more self conscious I became. I became self conscious about the way I walked. Stupid I know. I even became self conscious about the way I ate, or held a spoon/fork/knife etc. I started to view the world differently. I started researching physiological reasons as to why people did the things they did or why people act the way they do. And that was for everything, from society, to their likes and dislikes, to the way their brain is wired. I started to lose my friends because I was weird, and I became self conscious about it. Freshman year my friend called me “annoying” really loud in the gym. I was embarrassed. I stopped talking and I started filtering everything I said to the point where I don’t talk to anybody anymore. I lost all my friends. My grades dropped. I now have a 2.7 GPA. I’m scared of doing simple things like going to the barbershop because I don’t know where to look, or how to make conversation and I’m scared of getting embarrassed or even using “barbershop” terms to let the barber know what I want. (Meanwhile everybody else is dreading to go) Plus most of the shops in my area are Spanish. Although it’s my 2nd language I get self conscious about not being able to speak it fluently. I spend most of my time in my room. I despise talking to people because it’s a chore for me. The only person I feel comfortable around talking is my mother. Also another thing I do is that I fixate on really embarrassing moments of my life even when they occurred months or even years in the past. And then my self esteem always lowers because of it. Some things I really enjoy are skating and story games. I managed to make like 2 friends recently and they’re really cool people just from skating! Anyways I usually see people as machines conforming to society with problems behind the curtain of school, parties, hangouts, etc. Nobody has invited me to parties, or hangouts since middle school. I probably wouldn’t even want to go because I wouldn’t know how to act or be like. Embarrassment is my biggest fear. Throughout my junior year I became self conscious about every minute detail of not only my life but the life of others. I’ve managed to figure out what I want to do when I’m older. I want to become an aerospace engineer but I really messed up high school and it’s going to take a lot of hard work in college. Sometimes I get really depressed and think about a life where I didn’t have anxiety or anything or anyone that would cause me anxiety. I hate the fact that our world has many different morals. It’s both a good and bad thing. A hoodlum from the “hood” would care less if a 5 year old got in the crossfire of a drive by shooting. Someone like myself can’t even see myself critiquing another human being. That’s also a thing I can’t do. I can’t criticize anybody or be critiqued because I get so self conscious. For them and for myself. Anyways I really don’t know who I am because I’m always conforming to society. I barely even know my own likes or dislikes. I hate myself and this unjust world. I don’t know what is wrong with me. I’m sorry I wrote so much. If you got through it all thank you. It means a lot. And I don’t know if this is something every teenager feels or if something is wrong with me. I just wish everyday wasn’t a constant struggle with my own head. I’m writing this tempting to delete it because I wrote too much and half of the stuff would just fly by over heads."
lclgej," What was your way of becoming more social, talkative and able to open up and just be yourself?. Hello I‘m suffering from severe depression and social anxiety since I was 15 years old, now I‘m 21. I already did 2 depth-psychological therapies and am in a behavioral therapy right now. I already tried countless medications: Venlafaxine (Trevilor), Sertraline (Zoloft), Escitalopram (Cipralex), Seroquel (Quetiapine), Promethazin, Paroxetin (Paxil), Wellbutrin (Bupropion) Duloxetine (Cymbalta), Opipramol, Moclobemide and am on Amitriptyline 100mg at night now. Of all meds I reached the highest dose possible and none gave me any effects. I think the amitriptyline has a very little impact on my depression and keeps me from falling into the deepest depression. Additionally it helps me with my sleep but does nothing regarding my social anxiety. Right now I‘m a dumbo and abusing phenibut and kratom daily (which also are very subtle to me) as I‘m in an internship which is a must-do for my bachelor degree and without phenibut and kratom I wouldn‘t have done it, came so far or being able to the intern tasks I do here. It‘s still one week to go, after that I‘m going to quit phenibut and kratom and 100% experience withdrawal which will give me deep depression and anxiety again, I‘m sure. Well I wrote so much about my trials forgetting to mention the point of this post. Social anxiety was and still is the main source of my depression. My symptoms are mainly anhedonia (lack of interest, nothing that stimulates me or makes me fun); deep psychologically extremely hurting negative thoughts and feelings of emptiness and that I have failed life and will fail from the moment I open my eyes in the morning; cognitive deficiency (caused by yearlong depression); social anxiety and all its symptoms and restrictions to life (a big problem for me is that I never am able to think about anything to talk about, my head just feels empty and inhibited, as if I had no knowledge, memory or experiences at all); then also psychosomatic pain especially in my back, neck, shoulders. Even walking a bit or just standing, keeping body posture, sitting or walking stairs are incredibly exhausting for me. Social anxiety hinders me to build relationships (friends/romantic), open up or be myself and going out, in short it hinders me from experiencing life and developing. For example I hide in my room when I hear that my roommates are in the kitchen (even if I really have to pee or I‘m hungry as fuck). If friends ask me to do something I always invent excuses because my anxiety and panic grows big. If I‘m walking in the city or somewhere and I see someone in 100 or even more meters coming the same direction to me I’m like paralyzed and thinking about how to act for this one second he will be near by me. Like holy shit crazy unnecessary stuff I can’t control. I think that everyone observes and criticizes me, doesn’t like me, just waits for me doing something wrong and so on and so on. Irrational and exhausting things like that which continuously add up to my low self esteem of course. And what is a life without humans and social life, without being able to build up real relationships or feel interests, passion or fun. I feel like I don’t have a own personality. I feel like I don’t even know myself. I feel like my future has nothing to give. Life feels like living in a dead body for me. I feel alone, a painful emptiness and as if I have nothing to offer and no worth or skills, nothing. How should I even have developed myself or skills not taking part in life because my socially anxious brain hinders me from living, experiencing and by it: developing. It takes me all my self esteem and lust for life being like this. Just because of social anxiety. In short feel like a dumb, mentally and physically retarded, incompetent, always bad mood, antisocial and worthless washout. So my question to you, how to continue? How should I ever be able to work a real job like this (depressive, socially anxious and „dumb“), build up true relationships and have true friends and true girlfriends? (With true I mean relationships that I build up because I really wanted, relationships in which I can be myself, have fun and especially finally be able to open up.) How should I some day be a father of a family, feel fun, interest and passion, enjoy life and get through all the challenges and so called „life tasks“ that life will bring? About my resources: I‘m 21, in college, no future perspectives because of what I wrote about. I don‘t see myself functioning anywhere... 1. At least I was able to almost get through my bachelor somehow, am in 5th from 6 semester now (even if I took one year break in between). I don’t know where to go or what to do after my bachelor. 2. I have friends and family. But I can‘t be myself, open up or feel fun, even at my closest family members or friends. It all feels so untrue for me. As I said I feel like I don‘t have any personality. Everything feels so unreal, daunting, horrible and painful or just boring. 3. My physical appearance is no problem to me, without wanting to sound narcissistic I really am a pretty motherfucker (I get this told a lot lot). But this doesn‘t mean anything to me, it has no value, it doesn‘t give me any self esteem at all. I‘m still a mental wrack and slouch. I still feel as if really anybody else is 2000% better than me. 4. I had girlfriends and sex. I’m mentioning this because it was something that really helped me a bit as if I kind of checked this life task off like: Job done! 5. I am really anhedonic but still I produce digital music for Spotify sometimes and people seem to like and support it. 6. Im interested in neurosciences but it’s nothing I could make money with. 7. If you would ask me about my hobbies I would say tennis and skiing. „Hey see you have interests then“ yes but this is on a very anhedonic way. It still all feels so painfully empty and I’m just not able to feel/get stimulated by any of those things. But I can say that tennis and skiing help me with my negative thoughts for a moment. 7. We aren‘t rich (my parents are divorced btw) but I would say we don‘t have any financial issues. Thank you so so much if you read until here. I could write on and on. Like how my childhood was, what I have experienced etc etc. but yeah I tried to write down the most important things which could be useful for anyone trying to help. If you need any further information please just leave a comment and ask me anything you want! What are your suggestions for me? If you suffered from social anxiety too: What was your way of losing this horrible disease? Or more: What was your way of becoming more social and talkative, being able to open up and just be yourself. I really just want to be able to talk and talk and talk, have fun socializing, open up to other people and just be myself. Right now it seems like I‘m faking 100% the whole time and that‘s so exhausting and feeling wrong and bad. My therapy as well as I think social anxiety is really the biggest source of my depression as it hinders me from having social boundaries (which is really important for the human species), living life, going out and just experience things to be able to develop and grow in personality and knowledge. I feel like I kind of stagnated since I was 15 and started to become capable of perceiving my social anxiety and it‘s restriction =&gt; so: of course depression, a very low self esteem and restricted not enjoyable life.

e6emin6, Never been to college but in the one year I went to high school when my SA was growing I remember my first trip to their school restaurant and saw so many people. I just could not enter. So I went to the grocery store instead and bought a sandwich every day for lunch. Ate it at the docks by myself. 
5rhrw7,"Career counseling failure. So I made an appointment to see a career counselor at my college (an event in itself), and I'm completely disappointed in what they offered. nnInstead of acknowledging that I have a problem with people, and trying to tackle that issue, all they want is to find a way around it. I'm not sure what I expected really, but I guess I should've expected much. I'm not going to be a gardener just because I'm uncomfortable with people. Fuck that. I've worked too hard not to be the person shoved to the fringes of social society. I have a 4.1 G.P.A . (4.33 scale) and I'm in my second year. I'm not just going to drop out. I refuse to go quietly like that. Complete waste of my time.nnAnybody else feel this way?"
dfckca5, There is a great series of tapes about how to cognatively cure social anxiety. You listen to a tape a week and practice the coping methods in between. Let me see if I can find a link. It costs money so maybe I can upload my files somewhere. It's also on The pirate bay if you know how to bit torrent. 
pzcgno," Do you ever finally get the courage to stick up for yourself, only to realize you were actually in the wrong? That just happened to me.. I quit my job around 2 weeks ago. For context, it was a weekend job as a stable hand, and my (ex-) boss is also my horse-riding coach. I told my boss that I would be willing to keep working for “2-3 more weekends” if she didn’t find a new worker in time. A week later, she told me she “had me covered,” so I figured I was off the hook. No more getting up at 5:30am on Saturdays to shovel urine and manure! Yay! And then, this past Wednesday when I was riding at the barn, she asked me if I could work next Sunday (3 weekends past the time I quit) because the person that usually works that shift wants to have “one last visit to her vacation home!” (🙄) or something like that. I told her I “should be available then,” because I’m a total pushover. Today she checked in via text, asking if I’m still available next Sunday. I gathered the courage to say I wasn’t, only to realize *after* I sent the reply that I had previously agreed to work 2-3 weekends past the time I quit. To be fair, I never worked Sundays anyways, but I still feel like the asshole. And now my coach/ex-boss has to find some other poor employee to fill-in because the rich girl with the vacation home doesn’t take her job seriously. It’s also awkward because she’s still my coach and I worry that my flakiness will cause problems when I see her every week. Note to self: don’t get a job where your hobby is! "
fpfe0bf," I feel you bro. I'm in the exact same position but as a bagger for Publix, also 17. You gotta just treat everything as a joke and in your head tell everyone to go fuck their self. Who even are these people to you? Nobody. 17 is young as shit and you can't give a fuck what people think about you. I was the exact same when I started my job and then started goofing around. Bagging with my eyes closed, telling people random and funny things to get a reaction, acting like you can't understand someone, etc. It helps you not focus on what they think of you because it doesn't matter. Fuck those people. People may treat you like a child but it's most likely in your head. That's what I thought as well. I look super young at 17 because I only just went through puberty two years ago. I got a super young face and no facial hair everyone assumes I'm 14-15. But fuckem. They don't have to know how old I am because I know how old I am. If you keep staying in your head so much you will never ""come out of your shell"". Be the center of attention so you will get used to people looking and treating you a certain way. Tell a cute girl that comes through your line she looks pretty after a transaction and blush for 5 minutes then get over it, that will help. You won't see that person again and it will make both of you feel good. Just do the opposite of what you would normally do and don't care what anyone will think about it because it's your world and what they think about you is their problem, not yours. I know this is just advice from a stranger who doesn't know you but try and stop overthinking everything. I have had and still have the same problems as you and starting to realize it doesn't matter. Nothing matters and the sun is going to swallow the earth in a few billion years everything is going to die and what 25 year old Brittany thinks about you doesn't mean shit because she's a miserable cunt who's buying 30 rolls of toilet paper for her 3 kids. Fuckem. If you have Xbox or PC I would really like to talk to you because I know how much a friend helps when you feel like this. Good luck homie "
dsdg7dr," OP, you can try walking up and down stairwells of really tall buildings with music in your ears. No one uses stairwells because most people use elevators/escalators. I tend to exercise (I run) when it gets dark so no one can see me. I run around vacant buildings/offices inside their campuses. If you get off work at say 6pm and your bedtime’s like 10pm, you can get a solid 4 hours in. Download C25K / Zombies Run and start running in your backyard/some isolated place like a vacant park/running track. C25K is interval training so walking and running / stopping and starting is a part of process which means you don’t have to look breathless in front of other people if you do it during the day. "
euwry3c, So glad other people feel this way... like yes it would be amazing to meet a celebrity I love but I would just embarrass myself as conversations don’t happen when I’m involved lol so I’m not even going to try I got waited for autographs at a baseball game as a kid and my dad was telling us to call the guy over since my brother and I are short so we were saying his name and he got to me and I just looked him in the eye and like whispered his name lol 
dfm221w," I have this same EXACT problem too! It even happened today. I was asked to take a group selfie on a friend's phone since I am the tall one. My anxiety was at its peak. Haven't still found any proper solution for this though :( Guess we probably have to learn to live with it. However I have noticed a few things that help to some extent. The trembling is caused by adrenaline rush in your blood stream. Do exercise everyday. Exercising releases adrenaline. This way the adrenaline is released during the time you want it to. Drink plenty of water. Meditate. If you masturbate, just restrict it to once a week. Hope this helps. Wishing you the best. "
8xuwix," Confrontation on public transportation.. This will be a short story about a “confrontation” I had today. So, I was getting on a bus that was packed. (Packed enough where mostly every seat is occupied and a couple people standing up in the aisle.) I get to the aisle and see someone sitting on the outer seat, with the inside seat unoccupied. (When I first started riding the bus, I would never bother to ask if I could in the seat if someone was sitting in the outside seat because I was too nervous to. So, I would always just stand if there were seats available, but, would be a hassle to sit there.) So, I pointed, stood in her view, and asked, clear as day, “can I sit there?” Tell me why this girl had the nerve to pretend I wasn’t standing there and sucked her teeth as I stood there for an extra second. I knew she heard me because she sucked her teeth, not super loud, just faintly. I, simply, put my hand up in disbelief and stood in the aisle by the back door. Someone next to me acknowledged that she’s trash and I shouldn’t worry about her. I agreed and stood until a seat was empty. This story isn’t exciting, but, it’s what happened. As I’m standing, I was thinking maybe I should go back up to her and say “so, is that a ‘yes’ or ‘no’?” But, that only happens in fantasies and it’s not worth it anyway. "
d8pvau,"Me and my SO have been fighting. Me and my so have been talking for about 5 months now and as of recently we have been arguing because everytime I want to do somthing she does not, it started with us going to a sunflower patch and then a surprise carnival was in her town and I bought tickets but she did not want to go on any rides after I paid for them. (She does go on rides). She told me she got slot of anxiety and she was nervous which confused me. The next time we decided to hang out I asked if she could sleep over (she has Before) and she didn’t respond back and I sat there waiting for almost 15 minutes waiting on An answer and apparently I caught her by surprise but I couldn’t drop her home being she lives too far to drop her off very late, the last time we hung out last week she decided to hang out on a weekday and she caught me by surprise but I still wanted to continue my schedule by going to the gym and studying. We went to the river like she wanted and I asked if after she wants to work out and she didn’t so I asked if she could sit and talk with me while I do small home workouts she refused. Later that day my friend invited me for free food which is somthing that rarely happens and my friend wanted her to come too and she declined. Lately I’ve been feeling like anything I wanna do I can’t get done because of her anxiety, depression and her overall personality. I feel like I have to fight just to get her to come inside my house and at least say hi to my mom. I feel like I should I pace myself and slow down but I also feel she should try to co operate too. Thoughts?"
g7ig1xy," Lol I sat in the bleachers for an entire basketball game because I was too afraid to walk down all those steps, and have ther whole gym looking at me. "
56x9l5," Is it possible that CBT stopped working because I set goals too high for me?. Months ago I thought that CBT was working, my therapist gave me homeworks to ""take note"" and comprehend my thoughts and emotions, and also we did a bit of exposition. For example, I spoke to an ex friend of mine and at first I was anxious because I thought she hated me, but I was able to do the exercise. Or for example I was able to take horse riding lessons. But now since Semptember I'm not able to do anything! I quit the horse riding lessons because I had irrational thoughts, like ""everyone here hate me I'm a burden if I go"" even if it's not true and everyone were nice and gentle. I'm afraid to start new hobbies, plus I feel I don't have interests anymore, I'm tired. Recently I'm having a bad self image, I think I'm ugly compared to other girls more hot, more than me, and this affects my SA, when I feel ugly I can't talk to people or I can't make eye contacts with them. Yesterday I had this thought: maybe CBT isn't working because in therapy we set goals too high? I feel like I can't do the goals I've set in therapy. My therapist for example suggested me to continue horse riding, or to find a new hobby and maybe take other lessons...but I can't do this. She didn't suggest to lower my goals. I was able to do those activities in the past, but not now. I feel like she expects too much from me, maybe she thinks that I'm not that socially anxious only because in the past I was able to do things (go out, talk with a friend, take lessons...)...but that doesn't mean my SA disappeared. Now those things I was able to do scare me. "
gzjxg3,"[Vent] University and social anxiety. **TL;DR**: Life had been shit in the past, which ended up in me being very anxious. University is like living hell. I made it through the first year but I'm uncertain about the coming years. Just questioning everything. \*\* It's going to be a very long post and I'm not really sure if this is the right subreddit so pardon me. Also, *short disclaimer*: English is not my first language so there might be grammatical mistakes and inconsistencies with tenses and subjects. The main purpose of this post is to vent, maybe receive some wisdom or find people who feel the same. \*\* I guess I'll introduce myself first. I'd rather stay nameless. I'm a 19-year-old (M) first year undergraduate Maths student. I have never been to therapy or received any kind of diagnosis from a professional, so I'd rather not say I ***have*** social anxiety to avoid criticism. I'll just say that sometimes I get *very* 'anxious' and 'sad'. It's been like this since middle school actually. You know, being Asian in a small Italian town is not very easy. Plus, I'm very introverted and generally shy. Ergo, bullying and discrimination. That obviously affected me severely but here I am 8 years later. I haven't learned to cope with anxiety. The effects and consequences are pretty apparent, I would say. That's why in the past decade I haven't been able to socialise or do anything, really. I am just always at home. Oh, well, *was*. Where is *home* anyways now? You know... People always told me ""University will be different! You will make new friends! You can start a whole new life!"" as if anxiety is something I can just switch off or forget about. I did kind of have that expectation when I came here but I also remained realistic so that I wouldn't be disappointed afterwards. You might be wondering why the hell I came all the way to the UK anyways. Well, I'm not sure actually, but I 100% regretted that choice. I guess I just didn't want my university choice to be something I would look back at and regret. Moreover, my family has the typical mentality that school is basically your life (i.e. School = Life). So, if you want to succeed you need to go to a good University. I also wanted better opportunities and that kind of things. But my choice ended up being detrimental to my mental health. The first few months were absolutely terrible. I lived in an accommodation with 10 other people. You know, the ""social"" in social anxiety stands for something, but certainly not that. I couldn't complain to anyone since my parents don't know anything about my mental health and they're not supportive either. Mental health is sort of a taboo topic. So, I was just like ""Ok, maybe it isn't THAT bad.."". But it kind of was (is). I ended up locking myself in the room. I didn't eat, go to the bathroom (well, only when it was extreme), go outside in general or even attend lectures. The total number of lectures I attended this whole year (2 terms) is 5. I would hand in my worksheets at 3/4AM so that no one would be up. Attendance was a huge problem, luckily during the first term I met someone at one of the 5 lectures I attended and bargained with them. I would 'help' them with homework and they would sign me in. That worked out ok. In the second term, they stopped texting me. I was missing lectures and actually received a warning email from my University. I started attending some lectures, but then this whole coronavirus outbreak happened and kind of saved my ass, since online lectures are pre-recorded and attendance is not registered. Oh, the flatmates 'situation' kind of got better since I moved to another flat with 5 people. Which is still a lot but at least it's halved. The reason my parents said ok that I move was because they noticed I wasn't eating and getting unhealthy. But I still couldn't bring myself to go to the kitchen when I moved here, so I ended up buying an electric pot or something like that, cooked in my room and had constant anxiety that I might trigger the smoke detector. I just kept living like this. Well, now I can go to the kitchen since my flatmates all moved out because of the pandemic and I'm all alone in the flat. A lot of people will probably tell me that I should take a gap year and get better mentally or that I'm wasting time and money. I totally understand that. I also agree but it's not something I can really do. It's about my parents, family and traditions. I know that I should put myself first but that's hard to debate on. It's non-negotiable and I do not want to go against or lose my family. I also have recently been questioning my major. Whether I really want to study Mathematics. You know, it's been almost a decade since I really felt passionate about something. Since middle school I'd felt nothing. It had all just been kind of bland and tasteless. Nothing really stood out to me. Maths was the only thing that kind of motivated me to study but at the same time it's one of the main things stressing me out on a daily basis. I'm not that good at Maths. Obviously, I know more than average people because if that weren't the case I wouldn't be here in the first place, would I? But I'm not extraordinarily great, you know? I don't mean 'mathematician level' good but like I don't get 90-100% on every paper and exams. Moreover, I hate my mathematical proofs. I know that a lot of people might not be able to understand what's wrong with my proofs so let me make an analogy with essay writing (might not be accurate). My proofs are like unnecessarily long essays that try to hit the 2000 words mark, with excessive repetitions, trivial assumptions, grammatical errors and digressions. An essay that ends up making an inconclusive and baseless statement. At least, that's how I feel. I am very insecure about it. Moreover, what bothers me is that even if I get high grades I know that that's because I do it how my professor likes it, not because I'm good. I also don't really have a point of reference to be able to judge myself (I don't have friends of course and can't compare my grades with anyone, so I don't know if I'm average or awful). I feel like I'm not learning at all. I feel very lost and confused. I also can't stay focused at all. Anything will distract me. I never put 100% effort in what I do. It's like 70% at maximum. It's kind of always been like this for me. I don't know why it's so hard for me to dedicate all of my being to something. I'm lacking learning techniques and scheduling skills. I don't know how to efficiently approach my study material and how to effectively apply what I learn. I don't know how to be proud of myself either. I feel like I'm just always doing the bare minimum to survive. People who I have vented to when I'm anxious or have an existential crisis always end up suggesting me the same things and trying to comfort me in the same ways (same words and phrases). But if I'm still like this after all these years, it means I have probably already tried it *or* tried, failed and was traumatised by it. I don't blame anyone for saying the same things over and over again. It's just that after some time, hearing the same things is irritating because it's almost like they're implying I haven't tried hard enough or something along those lines. At the same time, since I grew up anxious, 'anxiety' makes up 50% of my personality and character. So I sometimes wonder if I really want to get better at all. Who am I without anxiety? I don't have goals, I live for others. I wouldn't be alive at all if it was for me, to be honest. These last few sentences might not make sense, sorry. I apologise for being all over the place. I keep getting distracted and losing my train of thoughts. I hope it all sort of makes sense. Have a wonderful day, everyone!"
d93xsdk," Completely agree. Social anxiety makes you feel very, very lonely. It makes you feel like you're the only weirdo in a sea of normal people. It can very hard to get help because, of course, you're afraid of talking to people. I browse this sub a lot so I feel less alone in what I go through. Like you said, it's good to know other people are going through the same shit. I love reading a post or comment and feeling like I can completely relate to it. I don't have any close friends or support base to talk about what I'm going through, so I'm very glad I found this community. "
5z2s3f," Outgoing and amazing guy through text, but can't say crap in person.. I've struggled with this for years now. This is the first time I'm actually telling people about it. It seems like I'm always texting a girl, and it seems like I'm totally normal when I text them. I'm outgoing, funny and a great guy to text. But I'm the most awkward, weirdest guy to talk to in person. I just can't talk in person. Recently, the girl I've been texting for months asked to hangout. Of course this kind of scared me, but I said sure just to try to challenge myself. So we go and get smoothies at this place and it was horrible. It seemed like she was trying so hard to make conversation with me but I couldn't reciprocate. She kind of got frustrated and asked why I can't just be like how we text. All my friends (all one of them) tell me to just let loose and not have a filter. I can see how that's true but I try so hard to just say what comes to mind, and nothing ever comes to my mind. My brother being the jerk he is used to tell me I act like a ""retard"" ( I hate that term so much) I'm actually starting to believe it now. I took one of those dumb quizzes online to see if I could be autistic and I got a score of 34 when 28+ is autistic. I'm almost 18 and only have one friend. It's not like my problem is only with girls either. I play varsity basketball and it seems like My team tries to befriend me but I just seem like a total dick because I literally can not talk, but I text like any other normal guy. Any help? "
aiwk8e," A tip that has really helped me - look at the situation at hand objectively and use the logical truth as the rational for making yourself look as ridiculous as you think you look.. I have god awful social anxiety. I’m on meds, I’ve been to therapy, I still suffer. But I’m running for a small election in my city now. Crazy huh? I’m terrified of getting on stage in front of 800 people and giving a 1 minute speech. But even if I were to mess everything up and do cartwheels into the audience, the situation at hand is worse. We really got people out here sleeping on the streets peeing in the river and getting attacked for being “illegal.” Until that ridiculousness ends, I’ll be as ridiculous (worst case scenario) as need me. This kind of goes along the line with being afraid to ask questions. You have a question, you are scared to ask in class. I can guarantee you there’s a least 1 person in class with the same damn question, and even if there isn’t it is good to hear reassurance/repetition of instruction on assignments. What’s more ridiculous, your “stupid” question, or you, as a student trying to receive an education, not having clear direction to succeed. You didn’t get this far to only get this far. Everyone is in the same damn boat, some of us are scared (for psychological and psychological reasons) and some of us really don’t give a sh*t. So ok, you “look” stupid and crazy. But has anyone reached shore? "
bklk2l," Today was worse.. Usually when I get Into conversation with a person I find it hard to speak I'm very quite, so quite that I think I find it hard to get and vocals out especially cause it feels like I've swallowed sand. The radiation feeling heat starts from my red cheeks, then to my gut then finally clammy fists. If the conversation ends quickly it usually just is red cheeks. But like today when I was in a conversation it was confrontational. The burning I felt throughout my body and expressed on my face made me feel fear as always. Which gets me so freaking knowing that they are seeing the red face, I'm sweating and can't speak. So much so that it makes me think of violent ways to get out of the situation. I hope this is just ""Adrenaline"". However straight after I was nearly in tears and shaking just after the confrontation. I am very calm it takes a lot for me to feel ""anger"" and I still to this day never properly used it. This anxiety attack is one of my worst. "
dg8dqir," Thanks for the reply. I'm working on it, but nothing has materialized despite my efforts. I went for a run on Monday and over did it, and my legs are just now becoming less sore. I'll try to work up the courage to go to the gym. I feel like I'm losing the battle right now though. I'm not sure how much willpower I can muster. I don't think it's so much that I have bad habits, but rather that I don't have any good ones. I'm working, but I'm breathing hard looking at a hill that looks impossible. I'm questioning if its even possible to get to the top, or if it's even worth it. "
5pvluo," I have overcome SA. Some practical tips.. Hi guys. I'm currently 21, and I have overcome SA. It's been a process of 3 years, but I have got out of it and I want to tell you some practical tips I've applied to myself. 1.- Identify people that can help you. When I came to university, I was outcast by absolutely everyone. But you can find some (many) people that can accept you. People that didn't talk to me and now are my friends. That was really surprising: when you become interesting and they enjoy your company, they forget when you where ""the lonely one"". And then, when you overcome SA, you can meet new people that know you from zero. 2.- Change. We all like interesting people. And you have to realize that: you wouldn't like someone that doesn't have anything to say, and the same goes the other way. See your ""extra free time"" as an advantage and get some hobbies: sports, instruments, etc. i.e. 2 summers ago I started swimming (alone) and learning about all that world, that is a very appealing topic to others. I also bought some dumbbells and started working out at home. Make a plan and stick to it, and wake up every morning realizing that it's worth it. If you become interesting, people will come to you. 3.- Stop thinking about others THIS way. I'm going to write something that really drove me crazy. I made my first ""uni friend"" (I mean, only mates but It was the first person I could talk to) and I didn't stop looking at ""last time on"" on WhatsApp, thinking about ""should have many friends"", ""I'm not among them""... until I did stop. The same with FB, twitter... And I felt really great. I think one of the bad things of SA is that when you meet someone you are really obsessed with that person. And maybe he/she moves away from you and it really hurts. Try to make many friends: don't stay comfortable with some person/group. This is really important, repeat it to yourself in your high moments. 4.- Happy face. Play some inspirational video or something similar every morning. Not a metaphor: do it. I noticed a lot of change when I started laughing and walking with a happy face. In others and in myself. 5.- Make a smooth transition. I.e. f you wear Tracksuit don't start wearing suit and tie tomorrow. If before I said ""don't obsess with FB"", now don't upload 500 photos of your first party after 1 month since your last post. I was too concerned that people started thinking I was weird because of changing my behavior. Do it smoothly. 6.- Think about conversations as a theater. People don't have a radar that detects who has SA and not. If you feel too nervous even prepare the conversation. I remember that the first days I used to think what I was going to say first. If I met someone that liked football, though I don't like it, I looked the last news. Once you do it some time, you won't need it. 7.- Don't worry. Thoughts hurts us too much. Relativize everything. Sit down one day and think about it. What happens if there's a long silence in a conversation? Nothing. Even in the worst case, if he thinks you are not worth it because you can't give small talk, there are millions of people out there. What is worrying is that that thought blocks you in every single conversation. What happens if you go to a party, you are alone and can't talk to anyone? Nothing, you go home and no one will be laughing ""oh, he's gone hahah"". What is worrying is that you miss every party because of that. Sorry for my English, I'm from Italy. This forum has helped me a lot, so I think I owed this. I can help with any question. "
e3vqz5e,"Can you reduce your work hours? Or maybe apply for a part time position on another ward? I know with my own anxiety levels I would find working full time extra draining. nnThe good thing about nursing is usually there are various shifts available and some flexibility of hours. Would working night shift be less busy? nnWould visiting elderly people in their home, a more mobile position in the community be a better job? It would be mainly 1-1 and you get to drive to each persons home giving you time for some fresh air and a short break. Or something else community based, mental health related or disability? nnI found working in disability with only one other co-worker on shift to be good. That was a community home setting (day services I couldn't do as it was very socially demanding and more like a school setting). It was the only job I lasted longer than a year in (4 years part time total). You could get to take people out into the community, go for drives or shopping. Helping people who need support the most. Once I worked a shift with a registered nurse who said she prefers to work in disability care/support because it is a less stressful job. Plus all your medical knowledge helps a lot as some people with disabilities have complex care needs.nnYou're not the only one feeling this way. It is manageable and I think you're in a good career no matter what happens."
g765dpb, Try taking a walk. And I’ve found that hanging a “live laugh love” sign in the living room really helps too. Just talk to people and stop being anxious!! Take deep breaths! 
dxwozss," Then the best thing you can do is to keep working on ways to get and keep that social anxiety in check, really :) To try and nudge your comfort zone bit by bit, to keep reminding yourself the things you truly want to do aren't even a smidge as shameful as the anxiety tells you it is, that you're worth taking these little risks to open up your world more and more, one step at a time. If the social anxiety isn't the real you that's underneath, then keep believing, keep fighting, keep respecting the person you are even with the anxiety making things more difficult. Coming across as awkward might sound like the worst thing in the world at first, but it's never stopped other people who aren't socially anxious from doing what they want either. So, why should you care? I know you can't just turn off these irrational feelings, but you can keep practicing, keep building better mental habits and coping skills to counter it, to help the anxiety become just occasional background noise and not hold you back all the time anymore. Just keep swimming, and get professional support if you don't know how to proceed anymore, you're worth it! "
f6uhh9k," You're not worthless so stop with negative thoughts. Get out of your room and go for a walk(walk the dog if you have one), then when you feel a bit daring say good morning or hello to a stranger. Call a company and ask them a few questions, like what time they open or if they have a specific item in stock. Try fake being confident, I tried it and it really did help It will be hard but you have to tell yourself that the thoughts you're having are pointless. Once you push your limits, think about how it went, it didn't go as bad as you made it out to be. Money wise you could sell some old stuff on eBay, there are postage services that will collect from your door if you don't feel confident yet. I've sold some old shit I've had lying around and made £500. I bet if you spent more time than me you could make a lot more "
cwfu5wm," Thanks anpeneMatt, I honestly don't know. I'm trying to meet up more new people using the meetups website. I'm in this anxiety group and its like the same I always have to initiate conversation. I went last week and there was a new guy there, while the others doing the activity, me and him were sitting on the bench resting. I was kind of waiting for him to initiate a conversation after around like 3-5 minutes of silence, but in the end I just initiated a small conversation because I really hate silences and I really want to be able to make some close friends. I understand that he may have anxiety but I really feel like I aint valued/or to be avoided. I am going again tonight, Ill try report back if I can Thanks again Matt. "
q2z1ii," realized how visible my anxiety is. i was watching a video of myself i recorded at the park (abt a year ago) and realized how visibly anxious i am. i was blinking so much and i couldn't stop moving my eyes because i didn't know where to look even though I was alone in that moment. I've tried to stop this these past few days but I just get reminded of it everytime and now i feel like it's the reason i feel stared at in public and everyone's just thinking ""why is she acting to weird?"" I'm so tired of this "
frhccdj," So true. I don't even know what to say when i see someone i know in public. Like today, i was skating, and two people i know but never talk came to say hi, and i literally didn't know what to say except 'hi'. "
40ojxp," Seeking a time machine.. 0This is my rant. I feel like an angrily kicked, stubbed toe at the moment, but it helps someone else else sigh in relief because they are off slightly better. Maybe someone can relate. Maybe someone has a an actual time machine to sell. Hello World. I'm 22 and only feel safe at home with the doors closed, lights dim. I live with my parents, with three college to high school aged siblings, waitress and play on the computer pretending to work. I want a time machine. I have ten thousand dollars, but can scrounge up another six thousand if I sell everything from my car to a kidney. Does anyone have an offer? Why do I need it? The truth is ugly, but if can convince anyone, I’ll rip off the band aid and explain. I failed all 3/3 college courses this semester. I could have graduated after this, but I only showed up for one class. The money is wasted, academic probation is harassing, my parents think I pulled through, and a lot of people at the college are frowning and saying what a dimwit. The machine must be able to at least travel back before October 13, 2015. The was the last day that I could have dropped out for the semester, when I last panicked, telling myself I would lose all financial aid for the future if I did. However, one that can travel back three to five years would be best. I don’t want to change anything leaving high school, except maybe, that I never placed top ten in a State Championships. My best placing was eleventh, top ten got medals. I won’t name the sport. Still, I graduated a class of a hundred as Valedictorian, top in every subject, an athletic state competitor, and active in too many clubs to even list. I went into college with enough credits to bypass almost all freshman year course requirements, and had worked that summer on research with a professor. I was pretty well set. Freshman year 2011: this is where I want to restart. I made the first mistake choosing my second major to be physics. I worked hard, found great friends, got A’s in all my other courses. But, physics was never my strong suit, and although curious, I should not have pursued it. If the clock turning device cannot go back that far, then the next preference is for August, 2014: Junior Year. I had just got an apartment with friends, and was still clinging to that double major, though I had C’s in most physics courses. Everything else was still straight A’s. How dumb and naïve I was! I ended up drafted into two major club positions (a presidency and vice presidency), and took a job at school. I imploded. I failed a lab course that semester, almost dragging my lab partner down with me. In both club positions I did hardly any work, then lied like the scientist who fudges his results. I spent that fall slowly crashing, hiding in my room, stealing my roommate’s food and binge eating. The next semester, I was certain I’d be found out, that my lab partner would turn my classmates against me, I would have to come clean to my parents about a failing grade. Everyone wondered where I went. I ignored them. Too scared and shamed to show my face on campus, I skipped the first two weeks and dropped out. I stayed in the apartment. Got fat. My money became low, but the school mailed a check for refunded courses. It was my parents’ money. I used to fight with them to pay my own way, but I stole that three thousand dollars, and didn’t come clean about it until the spring. I did get a job then, at a gas station, moved back home (which was half an hour away), took two local community college courses, aced them, and saw a psychologist for a few months so that I could get back into school the next spring. I switched to a waitressing job, dropped the double major. That semester I did well in classes, two As and two Bs. If I had taken the courses two years ago, I would have gotten all As. I lied to my parents saying they were the great grades again. This summer I turned 22. At second to latest, I would like to restart the clock in August. I thought my life was back this summer. I worked as many days as I could, on other days, I went hiking and to the beach with old high school friends and new ones I made at work. I was in the best weight and shape in years, and was starting to reconnect old friends. The trouble was I needed one research course for graduation, and I needed to ask professors to oversee the credits. I got shot down twice, and never signed up for the course. I again became embarrassed showing my face on campus. I went the first day of classes, to one class and never went back. I pretended to everyone that I was in college. I never dropped out, even though by the end of September I knew I should. I know it's pathetic. I’m a loser, at home while my old friends are off living across the US making their way. I stole non trivial amounts of money from my parents, and wasted the tuition they paid. In November I got worry emails from college about my nonattendance. I ignored them, and now it’s January. I’ve been telling my parents that I missed two credits and that’s why I haven’t graduated. And there have been plenty of others who were dragged down while all this occurred. Maybe at one time I had a plan to fix things up. It’s gone now, and my last hopes rely on a time machine. Please respond with any offers? "
6l98je,"Avoiding July 4th guests.. I'm visiting my mom for the summer, and we have guests over for July 4th right now. My uncle, little cousin, and my mom's boyfriend's cousins (who I've never met) are here right now. I like my uncle, he's funny, but I don't know how to bond with my cousin (he's maybe 11 years old?). I kinda just say, ""Hey! Nice to see you. The TV and the remote are over there. Watch whatever you like!"" I'm 17, for reference. Now, I REALLY don't want to face my mom's boyfriend's cousins. I don't even like my mom's boyfriend. I could go down and introduce myself, but that's about it. Immediately I'd want to retreat back to my room, where I'm basically hiding right now. My mom came up and I explained that I really don't want to go downstairs. Thankfully she understands that I don't want to be around people I don't know. I'm not afraid of other people in public, especially when I'm alone, but when other people are at my house, I become so anxious. Now I'm absolutely starving and missing out on barbecue because I much prefer staying alone in my room all night to trying to socialize with all these people."
gqpjt9," I went on a date?. It's only a question because some people would call it a date but I don't know if it really was because it wasn't established as such, but regardless, this was insane for me. So my crush from work (who you can read about in previous posts) and I started talking, basically since Friday afternoon. We were chatting through DMs on Instagram. We discussed lots of stuff, from animals, to work, to movies, etc. Out of nowhere, she says ""We should do something tomorrow"". I started getting panicky because I was like ""WHAT THE \*\*\*\* DOES SHE MEAN!?!?!"" and she started suggesting the local dog park. We agreed to go to the dog park the next day(Saturday) and continued chatting until 11:30 pm when I told her I was going to sleep since I was going to work the next day for a few hours. For just a little more context, we were texting each other almost non-stop from the time I got home from work(2:30 pm) until I went to bed(11:30 pm). The next day, I went to work, did my couple of hours, went home, and started texting her again. We finalized the plan for the dog park and even decided we would get food and eat there. I got there around 6 pm which was earlier than we planned. I just wanted to be 100% certain I wouldn't be late. She got there around 6:15 pm. Let me preface this next part by saying I don't like people touching me, mostly on my neck, back, or shoulders. Well, she got there, let her dog into the park, and then proceeded to hug me. I hugged her back to not seem rude, but the normal jerking response to try to get away when people hug me didn't even happen. I actually really, really enjoyed it. It felt really nice when she hugged me and in all honesty, I wanted to hug her longer. Also, to be fair, she is shorter than me, so she didn't touch my neck which I probably still would have had my normal reaction too. So the dogs ran around and I just tried and tried to talk as best I could to her. She picked up very quickly that I am ""shy"", but I didn't bother saying anything about social anxiety and the fact that I was literally screaming on the inside. We talked inside the dog park for maybe 30 minutes before we decided to move elsewhere in the park to sit and eat. We drove to a different parking lot and found a picnic table right next to the pond and ate there. We sat and ate and talked. That is basically all we did until 11:30 pm. At one point she went to her car to get a sweater because she was cold and how I wish I had brought a hoodie, I would have given it to her. By the time we left, it was pitch black and her dog who was walking all over the place the entire time, couldn't be seen if he was more than 10 feet away. I couldn't even see her face, but we still talked. When we decided to leave, we cleaned up and walked to the cars. Before we left, she hugged me again and I so badly wanted to just keep hugging her, but I didn't want to be weird. We both left and drove home. When I got home I messaged her to make sure she got home safe. We then started texting a little bit again for the night and actually started making plans for the next weekend, until I fell asleep mid-conversation. I apologized the next morning and we finished making plans. We should be going hiking this coming weekend(will probably end up making a post about that as well). I am scared, however, since my coworkers now know about the ""date"", I am afraid the word will find it's way to someone who may not be too happy about it and could reach a manager. Well, technically speaking it already has reached one manager, but he's really chill and he, as well as several of my other coworkers, are really proud I even started talking to her, let alone went on a date. I'm just scared someone, whether it be me or someone else, is going to screw it up and make me lose her(if she is even interested in me like that) and/or my job. TLDR: I went on a ""date"" with my crush from work, got hugged twice which I really liked, and talked for hours and hours in person and through text. Also, everyone in my department at work now knows about the ""date"" and that worries me. "

g1xfq3v,You are not alone. I haven't been out with my friends since quarantine started UK so about 6 - 8 months. I haven't even stepped outside during that time.
claa85," I hate ""the friend zone"". The worst feeling in the world is actually going out there and believing you're making a friend. Being deluded into thinking that someone finds you interesting and has common interests in you, to only find out they want nothing more than sex and when you tell them no, I ""lead them on."" This is why I'm so terrified of making friends. I had what I thought was a ""friend"" for 2 years. We did everything together and had each others backs until I started dating someone that he knre and he started texting me saying he could ""never respect a whore like me."" I was so shocked to think after 2 years of friendship that he only kept me around I hopes he would fuck me. I haven't had an actual friend in 10 years and I had an abusive boyfriend who was the only person out there who would hang out with me, and he drunkenly told me I was a ""slutty bitch who had to fuck for friendship"" when I was open about him being the only person in my life for years. I just want to kill myself because I'm female. I can't find female friends because I get nervous, and I can't find male friends because they don't truly want to be my friend. I've come to terms that I will never be anything more than annoying and boring and I am not interesting at all. I get so nervous when I talk to people and already have the assumption within 2 minutes of talking that they hate me. I..... just want someone in my life and I've been trying for 10 years. I've tried so fucking hard and I am now 21 and just have to accept that I've missed my social years and I'm too socially awkward to make friends. Because of my depression, I've lost interest in everything. I can't find common bonds with people anymore and I can't relate to anyone I meet. I feel like an alien. I even had to test to see if I had autism but I have no sensory issues and I know when I'm being weird by their reaction. I basically only listen to European death metal and The Smiths and I am only social when I drink. I have my boyfriend (because I am a whore who has to fuck for company), and he's been the only person I've hung out with for 3 years. I need friends my age and gender. I live in the Bay Area of anyone is listening. I'm just so sad and lonely and just want someone who won't be annoyed with me. "
6n1w2h," Does anyone else say sorry all the time?. I was out in public on my bike, someone was in front of me, they turned around and looked at me, I said sorry as I went past them. I don't know why I say sorry all the time but I do. I don't know if I'm apologizing for my existence or what but I just say it to people all the time. "
dxdrhqn," In Tibetan Buddhism it’s common to do a 3 year solitary retreat. So 3 years meditation constantly on your own. There are also people who do 10 years or more. A western Buddhist nun who did that was Tenzin Palmo, she wrote a book about it. She stayed in a cave the whole time. There are yogis who wander off and never return. For these people concepts of ‘alone’ just don’t exist. That’s part of the whole ego trip. The following is a massive quote (sorry!) from [this book I’m reading at the moment ](and there was a short section concerning the nature of our ego. “ Once this fundamental dichotomy of being has been created at the primary level by ignorance (ma rig-pa), then a process of evolution unfolds. [19] This initial alienated subjectivity then evolves into a secondary level which postulates the real existence of a subject which grasps or apprehends what is thought to exist outside of itself. At a third level this develops into a real sense of self-identity (bdag 'dzin), a conceptual structure or conception of oneself as a specific entity to which various properties are attached. This conception of a self, now felt to be substantial and abiding in the normal person, develops over time in dynamic interaction with its environment, especially its social and interpersonal environment. This illusory and ultimately false entity is then given the name of a concrete individual. At the next level this pseudo-entity called the ego (bdag, Skt. atman) appropriates everything in its immediate environment by way of the perceptions, feelings, and impulses that arise into consciousness, identifying itself with each of them and thinking ""This is mine! That is mine! This perception is mine, this feeling is mine, this impulse is mine!"" and so on. Now overburdened with the weight of so many possessions, the ego comes to crave yet more possessions, fearing it will loose what it already has. This desire for more and more will never be satisfied. Nonetheless, the ego takes pride in its possessions, thinking, ""I am this or that!"" And in this way, the ego becomes envious of the possessions of others in the range of its perceptions. It comes to covet what it perceives as belonging to the other. At the same time, it becomes anxious and fearful. So, the ego continually desires to be enhanced and appropriate the world perceived about it. It becomes angry when it meets resistance or denial by the other or when its desires are not fulfilled immediately. It becomes angry and hates those others that represent obstacles to the immediate gratification of its desires. This ego is like an infant newly born into the world, ever needful, ever demanding. Thus, there arise into consciousness the five kleshas or negative emotions of confusion, greed, pride, envy, and anger, and these in turn become the causes that generate and create cyclical existence, that mode of existence known as Samsara. And Samsara ('khor-ba), that which cycles or revolves (bskor-ba), represents not only the beginningless cycle of death and rebirth for all sentient beings in the cosmological sense, but also in terms of psychology, the mode of mental activity and thought processes that arise from moment to moment for that individual. Indeed, from moment to moment, with each flash of electricity across the neuron or nerve synapse, the individual dies and is reborn. Thus, Samsara or cyclical existence is, at the most basic level, the individual's normal mode of mental activity and being in the world. This process is otherwise known as interdependent origination (rten-'brel). Graphically and in symbolic terms, it is represented as the Bhavachakra or Wheel of Becoming (srid-pa'i 'khor-lo) mentioned previously. The mind is pre-eminently a process of becoming. Lacking any inherent existence (rang-bzhin med-pa), it is neither an entity nor a substance. In terms of its evolution, its point of origin is ignorance or the lack of awareness, and the main-spring of its mechanism are the kleshas or the negative emotional defilements, with which the ego or sense of self- identity is inseparably linked. When these kleshas or passions arise into consciousness, the ego identifies with them totally, is overwhelmed by them, and is swept away by them. It appropriates them, thinking, ""This desire is mine; I am this desire; I want!"" Or, ""This anger is mine; I am angry; I hate!"" and so on. Thus, from moment to moment, there exist a plurality of egos or selves representing this process of identifying with each thought, emotion, feeling, impulse, and perception that arises into the stream of consciousness. This on-going and unending process of identifying is the actual significance of the skandhas or the aggregates of consciousness which form the basis for Buddhist psychology. The skandhas are not entities or things, but evolving structures or processes that change in the stream of consciousness from moment to moment. [20] However, if these processes of the skandhas are put under close observation by way of introspection, it is indeed discovered that there exist here no entity or abiding substance inhering in them. If one searches for the mind within the body and without, one will not find it. It is this very unfindability (mi rnyed) that is the secret. [21] This sense of the self, called the ego, which is the basis for the apprehending and appropriating of the kleshas, is a mere phantasm lacking any inherent existence. It is unreal and an illusion, and yet, even though it is unreal and illusory, things continue and events continue to occur in the stream of consciousness. The self is empty and without any inherent existence, and yet events occur and the world process goes on and on. This discovery, arrived at by way of self- observation, which represents higher insight (Skt. vipashyana), opens the door to the possibility of putting an end (Skt. nirodha) to the on-going psychological process of cyclical existence. Its relentless cycling, this cosmic rat-race, can indeed be broken. [22] It is possible to liberate oneself from the machinery of Samsara-- the mechanical mind or computer, and realize one's enlightenment and intrinsic freedom which is called Buddhahood (sang-rgyas-pa). This represents both a complete purifying (sangs-pa) of all distortions and obscurations and an opening up and blossoming (rgyas-pa) of all potentialities for enlightenment. "
858dkc," Operation ""Talk to a single person"" ends in tremendous failure.. Today was Saturday night and saint patrick's day, so I resolved to try and actually have some social interaction. I havn't really talked to anyone in a casual context in a month or two, and I desperately want to try and escape solitude. The local college bar near me has a party every year so I thought what better location. I groomed myself, did my hair, put on nice clothes, and headed out. As soon as I arrived, I started walking around. I stood off to the side of a mingling area they set up. I stared and stared, looking for an opportunity to get in. Not finding it, I sat down on a nearby chair. Some dancing was starting, and I thought about getting in, but everyone seemed paired, so I didn't know if I'm supposed to just start shaking next to a bunch of people who know each other. That was the worst part: hundreds of people there and everyone seemed to know each other. I sat for nearly 2 hours by myself on the busiest night of the near sweating, panicking, hoping I wasn't looking like a weirdo, while desperately wanting to talk to someone SOMEONE. I really really did want to, but everyone was in circles, everyone seemed to already be friends. No bar seats were free. I didn't know what to do. I eventually awkwardly slipped in and out of the bar, thinking I could break into a conversation, but each time and stepped back out. After 3 agonizing hours, I got up and biked back home, hating myself more than I did before I came. I want to make friends. I want to date. I want to be social. The few times in my life where it happened I was happy. But I hate doing it. I'm scared and panicked and confused and just LOST. I hate it so much. I hate myself so much. Why is it so hard? I literally gave myself the goal of talking to a SINGLE PERSON and I couldn't even do that with hundreds of people. I wish I stayed home and read my novels, but I want interaction so bad. I feel like I missed the boat like 10 years and I'm left so bar behind. I have less social acumen then middle schoolers. I'm 23 now and I don't think its possible to pull it off. I just want it so bad. "
dr431f8,"Recently I noticed something about myself. Which is that I tend to push away people I like (or keep them at a distance), because I'm terrified of their opinion of me that it makes me uncomfortable being around them, which in turn makes them uncomfortable around me. This is why I have no friends. Despite the fact that I think I can be a pretty cool guy by myself.nnAlas, I have no advice for you because I don't know what porn eyes look like, I don't even know how to start conversations with girls I like. There was one time where a cute girl walked in front of me on the hiking trail and for 2 hours I was dying inside and it totally ruined my hike because I did nothing."
57gz8z," I don't feel like a normal person. So, a little backstory. I never really learned how to make friends outside of school, because those places were convenient and I didn't have to do much initiating. I was just put into a room and the people that were there became my friends. Even then, I had a little difficulty and discomfort around people that I didn't know well. I also had this problem where I reacted with hostility and aversion when I was touched by someone without asking or if they got to close to me, even if it was something benign like a hug or a hand on my shoulder. My reactions to this were often looked at as a source of amusement from people, to the point where they would intentionally try to hug me or something to get me to freak out so they could laugh. I feel like I grew more accepting of physical contact as I got older, but not completely. I would still prefer to be given some form of warning and not be surprised by it. Unfortunately, my anxiety, coupled with the fact that I'm an introvert, has put kind of a damper on my social life. Sure, I had friends, but I rarely hung out with them outside of class. I never dated or even tried to. I often used the excuse that I was too busy for that stuff and that I lived to far away from school for it to work, which was sort of true. However, that excuse kind of goes out the window because there are other people that were far busier than me and still found time to date. In reality, dating seemed so confusing and the expected physical intimacy kinda scared me. Hell, my parents forced me to go to senior prom. Cut to present. I'm 23 and I've been out of college for almost a year and a half. I recently started a new job that I've been working at for about 3 months and it's been fine so far. Unfortunately, once I get off work I come straight home. All the friends that I used to have have moved on with their lives with new jobs, relationships, engagements, etc. This has left me depressive due to the loneliness. I've tried going to comic book conventions and things like that, but I found it pretty difficult to start conversations with people, especially when there are so many. So, at the advice of my therapist, I joined a kickball league. I joined as a free agent and got put on a team with other free agents that got lumped on a team that only had two people in it at the time. I was nervous about it at first, but everyone seemed really friendly and I'm able to joke around and have fun with them. Cut to last night. The league that I joined goes to this one bar after every game(I don't drink, but, luckily, my teammates don't hassle me about it, which is partly why I enjoy hanging around them). These two guys came in and started talking to one of my female teammates who was sitting right next to me, asking some questions and saying something about her about riding the mechanical bull (the bar has a patio with one that we always sit next to). Clearly, they were going a roundabout way of hitting on her, so my other friends tried to urge them to go away by claiming that I was her boyfriend. I was completely caught off guard and just stayed silent, especially with them being so close behind me. They were skeptical of the lie and still tried to act really friendly to the point where one of them put his hand on my back as if we were cool. It actually made my heart beat faster because of how anxious it made me. I repeatedly told them not to touch me as best I could. They either didn't hear me or just ignored me, because they did it more than once. They eventually left, but I still kept thinking about that incident and how uncomfortable it made me. I thought that the discomfort and anxiety would pass. That is, until everyone started talking about some of their dating experiences with Tinder, Bumble, and the like. I got reminded that I this was a part of human living that I wasn't able to participate in because of my anxiety. This, along with the previous ordeal, made me quietly go home. Almost every night that I come home from kickball, I keep getting reminded that I'm not a normal person. I keep telling myself ""Normal people have friends."" ""Normal people date."" ""Normal don't join a kickball league whose central premise is being allowed to drink on the field and then go to a bar afterwords when they don't drink at all."" ""None of these things are for you."" Sometimes I wonder why I even try getting out there when I know that it isn't going to amount to anything. Sorry, I just felt like venting. "
et6x2jm,"At 20 I used to hate myself for not doing anything, at 34 as a father it is a beautiful thing. Don't hate on yourself, relax grab a book and a doob and chill by a tree for an afternoon. It's great."
f9su5i," I want to go outside now and I am having severe social anxiety.. Hello everyone, I want to go outside now and I am getting really panic. So I thought maybe I will post about how I feel in this group in that way I can get some positive energy. I just need to go to the supermarket to buy some food and if possible take a walk if the path is empty. I hope I dont get as many stares as before. My objective is to reduce the amount of people staring, looking and observing me, which as you know will make the anxiety level higher. Hope I can handle this. Good luck to myself. "
eip59in,"An interesting thing I've noticed is that a lot of people are constantly surrounded by friends. They will hangout with friends during work, during activities after work, while shopping, while jogging, while skiing etc. Some are constantly surrounded by others from the moment they wake up to the moment they go to sleep. "
i2lq0j," Me just rambling sorry ya'll. Anyone else never dated anyone in real life just online? Personally I only dated people online because I can get to know them a little bit better and feel more comfortable since one I'm not an outgoing person nor have I really talked to anyone in real life especially at school and two I'm not good with interacting and conversating with others. Like just the thought of walking up to someone trying to get to know them wasn't going to happen. I mean yeah I talked to some people like acquaintances and people I was cool with you know, but I definitely wouldn't date them because most of them were straight and they weren't my type lol, but yeah I just kinda always stuck to myself didn't have friends and wasn't really into the whole dating someone in high school thing... Plus I always felt different from everyone else at school which made me just not care about dating anyone.. I'm not even going to lie though even online dating makes me anxious just dating in general because people constantly want to call you or video chat with you which is quite difficult for me and I hate almost feeling like this freak or weird person for being like this even the thought of marrying a girl and eventually having a wedding really makes me overwhelmed because what if she wants a big wedding and all these guests? I would prefer a very small wedding in like a backyard or something or no wedding at all!! do I really want to get married? Not really it's not important to me... "
dpfdpp," Using ""masks"" to make it easier. First of all, I (20/M) have never been diagnosed with social anxiety or anything, I'm can even be quite a sociable person now. I do however experience a lot of the symptoms of social anxiety. However, I noticed something during my social interactions : It gets really easier when i'm talking or doing something as ""not only myself"". As an example, earlier, we were leading a group of kayakers (we're all around the same age) so I was not ""only myself"", but also one of the people supervising. And it was much easier to talk and do things and being more outgoing because it's kind of like I had a reason to act/talk as I did. But as soon as we were out, I was ""just myself"" again, and then I get much more distant, barely talk or only to people I know well. Other example: I worked this summer in a hospital. When I was with patients, it was easy to talk because I'm not 'myself' but a member of the staff instead. But when I was with my colleagues, I suddenly barely talk, overthink every single thing and stay apart. So I was wondering if anyone experiences the same thing or if someone had any advice on how to use this to help me get less socially awkward when i'm ""only myself"". "
dik18sr, Just waking up late I guess or thinking it's Saturday when it's Friday. Things like that. The calls come to me so it's not like cold calling but yeah you are absolutely right. Get present stay present. I haven't been meditating or doing much yoga although the last few days I've been pushing myself out of the house and in the sun. So that has helped but I've absolutely got to go in tomorrow. 
elm8e33,"I'm 16, i as well have trouble making friends, i move very, very frequently, so the friends i do make i have to leave them in the past. I recently moved from a school i had been attending for 3 years, i had 1 good friend and a few acquaintences and i always felt self consious about that as well. So now i been attending this school since the begining of school last year, and now school is almost over and the whole school year, no friends... not one. I'm not ugly, i dress nice and all that (not that it matters) and there is relatively nothing wrong with me, execept my social anxiety. I can't go up and talk to people. I can however speak to someone if they approach me. No one has. So, as a result i have the same scheduel everyday that i have to attened school, wake up, go to school, sit there all day and not say a word execept ""here"", go sit outside at the same spot for lunch alone and go home. I now look back at my friends from my other school. I felt self consious of being around them because they didn't dress the way i dress and basically, they were not ""cool"". I never acted a way towards them but in my mind i felt like that at times. I regret thinking and feeling like that now that i have NO friends. I don't wan't to be popular anymore, i will never be popular and i realize that now. All i wan't is that one close friend. I wan't to know how that feels again. So my advice is, enjoy and cherish the close friends you have. Don't want to be like everybody else, be a leader. All of them people who are popular are followers. You don't have to have alot of friends to have fun and interesting things happen in your life. You can have fun by YOURSELF, and maybe along the way you will make more friends but choose wisely! Go and do things that interest you! This may sound corny but life is whatever you make of it!"
rtl3zl,"Social anxiety and work. Im 25 years old male, suffering from social anxiety since i was a kid  and#x200B; I have had to deal with this curse my entire life, it produced me so much suffering trought my years at highschool and university, and now i had to deal with it at my job place. I am a junior engineer and this is my first job ever, i am supposed to be excited and happy because i am earning my own money and growing as a professional, but again, this mental illnes is making my life misarable.  and#x200B; I work in a small office from a family business, there are 8 workers besides me at the office, all of them are family which makes the situation worse because i feel like an outsider, i havee been working there for one month so far and i feel like i can't hold it any longer. The schedule is pretty shitty 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM, the office is not in the same city and i don't own a car or a bike (i don't have the money and i already have debt to pay), because the office is to far away from my home i need to wake up at 4:30 AM to take a bus, the morning anxiety is sickening. After the work day i arrive at my home about 8:30 PM feeling like i want to kill myself. The job consume all my waking time and it feel so overwelming.  and#x200B; The worst part is that i don't talk to anybody in the office, i tried at first days to make a conection with the jobmates wich seem friendly, but i couldn't pass from a ocasional small talk because i was so anxious. I have listening to them talking about me, the girls are the ones who most talk about me, i have listening to them saying that i am a creep and an antipathic and other things. Now when i tried to make a conversation with any of them, they avoid me. And to worsen the situation my boss as anger issues, there are screams and arguments on daily basis, altought he hasn't yeling at me yet, i feel so anxious with him around wich makes the situation worse. My direct supervisor is cold and sometime rude with me, it feels so akward when we have to sit alone to watch over my work.  and#x200B; I don't know what to do, just sit there in my desk 11 hours a day watching the screen and barely talk to anybody, i feel so anxious all the time, even in my off day i can't stop feeling anxious, the thing is that finding a job in my country is not easy, i was unemployed for six moths prior that and i really need the money to pay my debts.  and#x200B; How to cope with my sitation? I have tried therapy in the past with two diferent psycologist and it do nothing for me, the only thing i haven't tried yet is medication/drugs, i just want to be a normal person, having friends at my job and don't having a panic attack everytime the alarm goes out in the morning :("
eyuz715,I swear every single time a car passes by me when I’m biking to work I feel like I’m having a panic attack. Even though 99.9% of the people who pass me have no idea who I am and just don’t care.
hjsugiw,"wow that's good advice. I'm actually a really energetic goofy person in nature and I love talking to people, I just can't bring myself to do so because of social anxiety, so I seem reserved when I actually am not this way. It's like forcing myself to hide everything that makes me me out of fear. Also, how could I recognize the deep root of my anxiety? is there a way you suggest I go about it?"
ha8hxt,"Avoiding getting a full time job. So I'm 23 currently a dog Walker but it's only part time, I dont have much experience doing anything else as I've only been a part time cleaner when I went to college, I need a full time job but theres nothing I want to do the thought of working any job scares me as I dont like to be around people and i hate the thought of not being able to escape.

dlx7zj0,"When I spend &gt;4 days in solitude in my cabin, SA starts to seem like a very distant, almost petty thing.

ddxh8fe," You have access to the best remedy of all; your mind, more specifically your perspective. There's this app I used to use called Headspace, it's a mindfulness training tool that you can use in your downtime to train yourself in becoming more aware of yourself in stressful situation. I used to go to my park and sit at a bench while listening to it. It's a 10 day exercise that lasts 10 minutes a day if I remember correctly (there's also a payable feature that can extend this to a year). It really did help me. Of course there are natural 'drugs' you can take that might loosen you up, I'm sure you've heard all what weed can do. It's tough to find a substance that alters your mind without you actually feeling it, this is where a lot of prescriptions come into play, they can effect you without you actually feeling much. But I'm in the same boat as you, I stay away from prescriptions. "
fiqf4f7," No, unless I am going too. I will pick you up, but I need to fix my bike first :) "
g3xy7m0," same here. the only time i leave my house is when i force myself to go biking around (not far tho) and it's a recent progress. but like you, i have no clue what i want, especially regarding jobs and it scares me for the future. tbh, i wish i was retired already but i probably won't even get much retirement money the way things are going. "
dim4pb1," I am in the same age and boat as you do and I completely relate. Maybe except the class clown part because I was rarely the person of choice of social interaction since young. I don't consider myself completely socially inept, I can hold a conversation decently well regardless of topic, but most people just seem to like engaging in extended periods of small talk about essentially nothing, and I tend to be a mellow (and somewhat gloomy) person who prefers actually having ""connections"". Regardless, being a 26 year old guy with Social Anxiety, especially if you have close to nothing to ""show off for in life"" is going to suck balls, 'traditional 'society tends to define the 'ideal late 20's man' as having lots of great friends, seemingly free of problems in life, courageous, drink beer, have a high flying career or at least on the way to, have a gf and take care of her well/maybe even married and all that jazz etc, I'm sure you know what I mean. SA sufferers (usually) are the completely opposite of that, and it creates anxiety on top of anxiety we already have and the result is a life that is much tougher than it really has to be. "
ekly0dy," I will live at home, university is not that far away. Ya, suicide as emergency exit out of life is a nice thought, although I also think I will never be able to do so. I can't even cut myself. Brain transplant, lol :D Ya, something like this would be great, I wonder whether hypnosis, drugs or something like this would help. Or if it's my genetics that sucks or if the first years of live brought me in this direction. This friday, we have or last class trip, but since my best ""friend"" shares his hotel room with others (the last years we were always in the same room), I am scared I'll be totally isolated during this trip, so I think it's best to tell school I'm ill. Do you have any coping mechanisms? Like going for a walk when it's dark (in our 'family' is a dog)? That's what I do sometimes, feels like I'm invisible then, the only time when streets are not infested with strangers. Btw sorry for late response, Reddit sent me no notification for some reason "
e44w3ij," Male 21 I've been stuck in a cycle of uninstalling and reinstalling tinder for years. I can't bring myself to message new matches and they usually never respond when I do. I have horrible self confidence and I'm super worried about my body image, I feel like being a man is a huge disadvantage. As a man I basically have no value in the dating world, there's plenty of strong attractive ""chads"" out there. I feel like most women are constantly getting bombarded with messages and I'm just some random undesirable creature from the void in a literal sea of dicks. No woman in my life has ever showed any kind of attraction or interest in me and I've never been texted or messaged by anyone. I have a crippling distrust and fear towards women and I've never even hugged a girl before. It started when I was a kid when my middle school crush and I were friends for about 2 years when I asked if she wanted to be my girlfriend, she said yes but her parents wouldnt let her (which I never doubted since they're strict). I never realized she wasn't interested and only said it because she didn't want to say no. I would've been fine with rejection and I would have easily moved on and stayed friends, but she played it out for a while but would always be ""busy"" when I asked if she wanted to hangout. Which I get it, everyone's busy, people have things to do, but no one's busy every day for months on end, especially someone in middle school, people make time for those they care about. Then one day she just dropped it all on me rather harshly. She said I was a fat disgusting piece of shit and nobody loved me etc... she said she was never interested in me and that she was a lesbian. She never really gave me any indication leading up to that about how she felt, she was my second closest friend and she basically crushed me, I eventually recovered emotionally but I've had horrible anxiety and self image problems ever since. I don't know what made her feel that way, I was never mean to her or anyone, I never really did anything wrong to make her feel that way, she just saw me as an annoyance. She's entitled to her opinion and I don't really care what she thinks, I live my own life, but she definitely did some mental damage after that. My family and friends all tell me I've never been the same since, I used to be a happy playful kid when I was younger. Ever since then I've been very bitter and depressed. I still feel almost afraid of women, I always feel like they're watching and judging me. I'm too afraid to even put myself in that situation, that's why I don't use tinder. "
cy08pb," Anxiety makes me nauseous and throwing up / vomit.. Hey, Everytime when I get anxious, my stomach goes crazy. I get nauseous within seconds and have to vomit. This happens when somebody text me and says he wants to hang out with me (eating, swimming, birthday party). After vomiting (at home) I feel fine, like finally there is nothing I have to be scared about. Of course I am sad because vomiting is not the solution. I got this problem since I am a kid. Now I am over 20. I am not afraid of the act of vomiting. But I know that I have to vomit when I have panic and throwing up in public is not my favorite thing. This results in avoiding places and meetings with friends, where I would like to be, but the fear of not being able to escape and vomit in front of others is too big. I already vomited a lot in public. It is really happening to 50% and not only a feeling. I was 3 years in therapy. I took Sertraline (50 mg) for 2 years and gain weight (which is good). Anxiety wasn't much better. I stopped taking Sertraline. Benzodiazepine is not working for me somehow (2 mg of Lorazepam = no effect). Propranolol takes my strong heart beat, sweating and shakiness away, but my main problem is the stomach and nausea and Propranolol is not working for that. I am feeling lost. Sitting home and trying to find a solution makes me sad, because I can't find any. Checked the whole internet for the 100th time, nothing helps me. I am still a student, but finding a job, applying and interviews will kill me. I can't eat with friends, can't swim with them, can't do anything. Life with anxiety nausea is horrible and give my life no sense. My life without nausea and vomiting would be perfect, really. There would be nothing else I would fix on myself. Anyone else have this extreme anxiety nausea and vomiting? How did it start? What helps you? Thanks for reading. "
ep6uzs9,Had a breakdown 2 day before the last day of school because of fucking presentations. My teacher let me sit outside and she told me “anxiety is a bitch” then my friend Micah had one too. He didn’t cry but he almost did he went mute and wouldn’t say anything so he got to sit in the hall too. Then me and him had a deep conversation about how this always happens and I really connected with him that day. Talking to him help me feel better and I ended to convo with “well at least I learned how to skip a whole class period” then I walked out because my mom showed up to get me after I called her crying. Sorry for random story
g5c25w9,"I hope I can get to that point eventually. I barely leave the house anymore though. I don’t think I’ve even stepped outside in like 15 days. Over the last year, I’ve really developed a crippling fear of being judged in public. Even someone glancing over at me makes me uncomfortable. Low self esteem + Social anxiety suck."
exkkr1i," One of our neighbours has something, I don't know what, maybe social anxiety, maybe he's autistic, but anyway he's really shy. He rarely comes outside unless he fixes his garden, and he does that as quickly as possible. My mum likes him and thinks he's a sweetheart, so she once sent him a Christmas card and we actually received one back from him. She always says hi to him, and at first he didn't really respond, but just a few days ago my mum proudly told us 'He actually said hi to me today, out of the blue!', and apparently he said it very happily and it was so sweet. I never had trouble saying hi to people on the street, but I have social anxiety so I can imagine how hard that might have been for him and I'm so proud and just want to hug him, but that would be weird.

ah5wig," Friends for an anxious introvert. Hello all. So I’m a 14-year-old freshman guy who is awkward, anxious, occasionally depressed, and introverted, and in need of a real bro. I can be pretty awkward if I don’t know what to talk about, and it can be really hard for me to initiate/carry on conversations with new people because of that. I’ve never played any video games until this Christmas when I got a Switch and Breath of the Wild (which I love). Unfortunately it stays at my dad’s house, which isn’t a viable option to invite friends to. Anyway, due to my lack of game savviness, I have a pretty major disconnect with most guys my age because I can’t relate or give any input to their most popular conversation topic and activity. I have some guy friends that are nice to kind of chat with at school, I just need a bro to really bond with. I desperately need a meaningful same-sex friendship. Some direct questions are below: -How can I make a new friendship with another guy that I can develop? I’m not looking for guys who are just walking meme fountains that do nothing but spew surreal quotes and meme references to the point that they won’t carry on an actual conversation. Currently this describes most of my guy friends. Don’t get me wrong, they’re fun, but they don’t feel like true friends. - -What could I do with friends out of school? It has been years since I’ve done something out of school with friends besides my birthdays. Neither of my houses are really options (my dad is far away and there is literally nothing to do at my mom’s but board games). -How can I stop being so damn awkward?? This is seriously my biggest problem. Unless there is something actually happening to talk about, I basically become a stuttering dork who can’t figure out what to talk about, because, you know, anxiety and social awkwardness. For this reason I tend to usually walk alone and don’t engage in conversation with most people. I’d genuinely really appreciate anyone who’d care enough to give any kind of input or even just read this. Thanks guys "
czkfjvo,"I'm still in the thick of it, but I generally feel better these days than I did one year ago.nnIt's little steps at a time. I try to smile when I'm getting self-conscious and realize I'm letting myself be in a negative mood. I have become more focused on getting the essentials down: Appropriate meals, water, fresh air... I can't quite get the proper sleep routine yet. Always end up going to bed at 2-3am and be really tired at 8am next morning.nnBut it's just little things like that. It makes you more confident in yourself. Next I can try to focus more outward once my conscience is better."

o5o4cq," Failed at going to the skate park, yay!. So I was bored and made a poll in r/polls so other could decide what I'd do. Going to the skate park was the winner, and I wanted to do that anyways. So I got myself ready and left the house. Just getting out of the door was difficult because I could hear everyone in the kindergarten next to my house but I made it. Then I was walking along the footpath try figure when I wanted to go into the road(they're super nice for skateboarding) but there was either a bike or a car, something always stopped me from leaving the footpath. That was already super awkward because I couldn't walk any further because I had to turn left here and cross the road. But then another car came and idk why but that was just the last straw. I realized I would never even make it to the skate park like this and turned around and just went into the playground right outside my house(it's completely surrounded by trees so no one can see me in there). My (what I think is) SA has never really been this bad. Not too long ago I was going out to the book store in town regularly to buy books. And yeah being in town was uncomfy but I was able to do it. -&gt; to the book store thing: I really wanted to go to the library instead because DAMN books can get expensive but there were so many thing scaring me. COVID regulations were still a lot stricter then too. 1. Customers were only supposed to stay for about 10 min(I get why) but I take wayyy longer to find the right book and I was worried that some worker would come up to me and be like :"" could you please hurry so that other customers can come in"" and I know that isn't a bad thing but it still scares me 2. I don't remember how everything works... I haven't been there in YEARS. So like I can't fucking go there pick up a book and then be like :"" what do I do? "" 3. I know I'd have to talk to someone there and I don't know what to say 4. I was worried that my library card from years ago has some how expired or something and then idk what would happen 5. What if I don't find the right book and then leave without yk ""renting"" a book. That's like going into a shop and not buying something, super awkward 6. What if I find a nice book that's maybe wlw but then I go to the register or whatever it is and idk they judge me or smth. Like I know homophobia is like wayyy better nowadays and I haven't had anyone rude yet but idk it's still possible Sorry this turned out do long, was really just tryna tell y'all bout the skateboarding thing but then I remembered the Library thing and just went off. (Apologies for any spelling mistakes, too lazy to go through the whole thing and check for em) "
cq2gdx," THE CONCEPT OF HERDERISM: A CONFRONTATION A DAY WILL KEEP THE RUMINATION AWAY. Follow me at: [Practice herderism. this a movement to empower the gutless. Unlock the herder within you. In this day in age, there are so many positive lifestyle improvements going on: Intermittent fasting, NoFap, Monk Mode. All of which I have tampered with myself and did help me tremendously. Where I got the term “herder” is from a book called the Outliers by Dr Malcolm Gladwell.  In it, he defines humans as coming from either herder or gatherer cultures. To put it in a nutshell, how your ancestors approached confrontation is imprinted in your genetic memory. According to Gladwell, herders typically follow “cultures of honor”. In cultures of honor, you are less likely to display shows of weakness and prone to confrontation. Gatherers dealt with affronts in a more passive way. Of course, there are certain situations where being passive is the right way to go, but very seldom. Especially in the business world. I believe we all have herders and gatherers somewhere in our genetic memory. Every person alive from every nation is descended from a conqueror. That’s how nations are born. They are borne by herders. No matter what I did, whether working out, fasting, yoga, I could never find a shortage of disrespectful or condescending people popping up in my daily life. From this frustration and hopelessness, herderism was born. A big contributor to rumination and from there, anxiety, among many people of my generation today is a fear of displaying or asserting your dominance. You know what I’m talking about. Let’s say you dealt with someone who was being unreasonably rude and disrespectful to you out of the blue. If you’re like me, you would spend the whole rest of the day and night overthinking and replaying the whole incident in your head, thinking of better ways you could have stood up for yourself. Unlock the herder within you. When you feel weak or incapable of standing up for yourself or timid, people will sense or see that trait in you faster than you would think. And they will take advantage of it to make themselves feel better by trying to flex themselves on you. In the end it’s on no one else but yourself to prove them wrong and show them you aren’t someone to mess with or basically you’re not a doormat. Unlock the herder within you. Here is the challenge. For only 10 days, i want you to get out of your comfort zone by asserting your dominance. I’m not going to say get into a confrontation or altercation because that’s not only what’s necessary to do be a herder. It doesn’t have to be aggressive. It could simply be calling out someone who you see loitering to put their trash in a bin, telling someone who cut in line to get in the back where everyone else started or telling your rude, distant coworker to tone it down a notch. A far cry from riding on a horse into battle, but I promise you, simple, subtle acts such as these will trigger the same herder response within you. Now of course you may be wondering, in instances like these, even if you are not aggressive or confrontational in your approach, you will never know how the other person will respond. If that happens, then that is the golden opportunity to unlock your inner herder. This is a chance to show your worth by showing no signs of timidity and stand your ground. It will build your herder-derived “toughness muscle” and weaken your fear of confrontation. If someone is going to try and fight you over something like telling them to put their trash where it belongs or not to cut in line, then obviously they’re the one with a problem, and you can walk away knowing that whatever you are going through in life, at least your ego isn’t so fragile as to become offended by a simple word of criticism. **Over time, you will lose your fear of confrontation and that is the fundamental of herderism.** I’m not saying go out and start a fight or be rude to the next cashier you see. That just reeks of insecurity and lack of class. We can be herders and still live in a civilized society. This is not the arid steppes of northern Tibet or the Scottish English borderlands of the 17th century or the Kentucky-West Virginia frontier towards the end of the 1800s. Be alert and aware, not paranoid. Some of you might find that there is a subtle distinction between these. Think of this way: we don’t live in a perfect world where every person is going to be respectful and kind to you. If you’re familiar with the manga and anime series called Berserk by Kentaro Miura, the main character, Guts, has a really hard life that’s full of violence. Then certain circumstances arise and he finds himself hunted by demons wherever he goes further exacerbating his already harsh life. You see, that’s us in our young adult years. I’m not trying to pull any kind of card here, but this is especially true for us men who are in our twenties. Let’s be honest, we don’t have a very good rep in the world right now. We have this stereotype of either being slackers, partying all the time, always seeking short term pleasure and overall just undeserving of respect by whoever we meet. That’s why you gotta prove them wrong. Because if it isn’t you, it probably won’t be anyone else for a while. By doing that, you might be making life easier for the next guy in their 20s who they deal with and feel like they can just walk all over them without consequence.  Assert your dominance. Then stand your ground. For me personally, I have direct links to a herder background being that I am descended from pastoral nomads in Tibet. So it doesn’t get any “herder” than that. But I grew up here in the US and as a child till now, I always knew I had a fire in me that was waiting to ignite, but I had no idea of knowing how to harness its power. Part of the reason being that in our Buddhist household, the distinction between being defensive and aggressive is somewhat subtle, to say the least. But I believe that we all have a herder somewhere in our ancestry, and that herder or those herders in our gene pool have been suppressed by this culture of being non-assertive and being overly sensitive.

6yuje3," Old Social Anxiety Feelings Coming Back. When I was younger, I had symptoms of social anxiety. I worked through these problems with a therapist, and now I’m pretty much healed. But some things have been happening lately that are triggering some old feelings. I quit playing basketball as a teenager because of said anxiety feelings. At the start of the year, I went back to playing basketball. I thought it would be good because physical activity can help mental health problems, and I saw it as a good opportunity to meet other people and get involved in a community. I’m 23 years old and all the other players on the team are 16 years old. The coach asks me to give the other players a lift every week but as soon as they’ve said hello to me, they sit in the back seat and talk to each other. They always sit in the back seat, too, even if the front seat is free. Makes me feel like there’s something wrong with me. They get out the car and walk ahead of me into the stadium talking while I’m still getting my bag out of the car. I’ve tried small talk attempts but I only get one word answers. I know that I was pretty awkward like them at 16, especially due to the fact I had anxiety, but I’m starting to think they’re being quite rude. On the rare weeks where I don’t give them a lift, they make blunt comments on court like “that was stupid” or “what are you doing?” to me and no one else. And I know that I’m not a bad player or anything. I score as many points as anyone else, I don’t hog the ball, and I try to be friendly and encouraging. I just don’t get it. The club asked me to manage the team and wanting to break into the community, I said yes. Sometimes it seems like nobody cares about the team except me, and to be honest I don’t really care that much, I feel like I’m only caring as much as anyone else should. The other players often tell me they can’t play due to sickness or injury an hour before the game. One game I arrived at the end of the first quarter because I needed to find a fifth player for our game. I was incredibly frustrated because the game took place an hour away from my home. The team was down by 20 when I got there because we started with 4 players. I was feeling pretty down by then and had no motivation to play well. I sat away from the team during time outs. The coach asked my partner about me later on in the week when he bumped into him but never said a word to me. This really upset me so I refused to play the next week. They didn't take me seriously until I didn't message them with game details the night before. I trained with another team in the club the other week and they were so encouraging to each other and very welcoming of me. Too bad I can’t play for them because I’m the opposite gender. It’s bringing some old anxious feelings back. The ones that brought me to the point where I was afraid to go out and needed therapy. Like I'm doing something wrong but I'm not sure what it is. What do you think? "
i4wvft,"Neighbor knocked on door. I know this is so stupid to post but I’m having a bad panic attack . My neighbors just knocked on the door (I hid in the room with my dog ) and usually they want a ride somewhere . They always ask my dad to take them to work . But I know that if I take them somewhere , they will literally ask me everyday if I can give them a ride to work . (They work at the same place) . I have to take my dog outside in about 30 minutes and I know they will catch me outside . I fucking hate this man . Why does something so stupid send me into a panic attack . It doesn’t help that I’m always home so they see the truck never leave the drive way ."
iqoywk," I feel like an outcast. I live in New Zealand, I was born here and I grew up here. Unfortunately, I've had a pretty rough time in the past with bullying, and my living conditions at home are pretty terrible and I've hated myself for as long as I can remember. Because of this, I have an irrational dislike of my own country, because all of my bad experiences, and all the people who have bullied me in real life, are in New Zealand. But when I escape into online content like Youtube or Twitch, all those people are likable to me, and they're always American, or European, or whatever. I know that logically, my country is one of the best in the world, and it's full of great people. But that's not how I truly feel deep down. When I walk around my local town, sometimes I see people and think ""I don't like that guy. He seems like the type that would've bullied me in school. What an asshole."" I know for a fact that this is irrational and stupid, but I still have this mindset that everyone in this country, by default, is a total piece of shit until I see the nice side of them. Recently I went on a small trip to Queenstown, which is a tourist-y town with lots of adventure-based activities on the South Island. I tried to convince myself I had a good time, but that's just lying to myself. It was actually pretty bad. I went up a mountain in a gondola, and there was a stranger in there with me. I have really bad social anxiety and I didn't even want to look at her. She asked me to take a picture of her with her phone, and I did. She was a nice person, but it was quite awkward and afterwards I felt depressed for making a fool of myself. Once I got to the top, there is a ski-lift that takes you to an area where you can ride a luge. I was a bit confused about where I was supposed to go, so I asked someone who worked there where to go. His response was something like ""Just join the queue over there, like all the other humans."" This response made me feel shit because it seemed like he was making fun of me for asking a simple question. I went on the luge, and after a while I decided to get on the gondola and go back down the mountain. This time, I was in it by myself. As the gondola passed a group of people taking photos, I heard them booing me. They probably did it to all the gondolas that were passing, just as a joke, but it still made me feel worse. Then, a little while later, I was waiting at a bus stop to catch a bus back to my hotel. While I was waiting there, a car was driving past and it honked it's horn. I looked up, and a man in the passenger seat was pulling the finger at me, they then sped off laughing. Again, this made me feel even worse. All these things that happened in one day, it made me feel like some creepy loner that nobody likes. This is just one example of how anxiety and depression have ruined things I should otherwise enjoy, like going on a solo trip. It's just so depressing that I can't even go out and enjoy myself without little things making me feel terrible. If you have had feelings like this before, how have you dealt with it? Am I over-analyzing things here? Like I said, I know logically that there are plenty of great people out there, but when I ""go out there"" I just feel bad, I have a feeling of resentment, and I feel like an outcast. I just want to be happy. "
os70ue,"Just wanna give my advice. I'm very confident it will help a lot of people out, so please do read carefully. For much of my youth, I've been struggling a lot with my social skills. Right now I'm 23 and feeling better than ever. I'm not trying to sound like a guru that mastered the arts, but I am confident lots of you will be able to improve much better if you follow this advice. I explain everything in detail as it's a very logical approach. Again, not trying to sound like an expert, but I've spent a lot of years trying to understand how human behaviour works in terms of social activity. You've probably heard this advice a million times already: ""Just put yourself out there!"". The advice itself is actually good, but you'll never do it because it's too scary. We can make this much easier by seeing all of this as a video game with a leveling system. ## Game plan ### Step one: Rank yourself You first need to know where you are at in terms of social skills compared to others. Let's use the scale of 1 to 100. Be really honest with yourself here. Do you avoid any contact whatsoever? Put yourself at 0. Do you only talk to your closest family? Put yourself at 5-10. Are you able to make some friends, but are you still not comfortable around them? You're somewhere around 15-20. This step is very crucial. It allows you to get perspective on where you are and let's you set *realistic* goals. You can't ask out your crush if you're a level 15. If you do, your chances of being rejected are too big. When that happens, you lose all hope. They're probably a level 80, no wonder it's so hard. Ever tried to raid a level 80 as a level 10 in any game? Exactly. Don't try it if you don't even know how to expose yourself to others. ## Step two: Gain experience In order to level up, you need to gain experience. You can get experience by completing tasks. Each task has a level attached to it. It's the same as your own level. You can handle it just fine, but you don't get as much experience. If you complete a task that's just a tad bit harder than the usual stuff you do, it will give you a bit more experience than usual. To take this to the real world, let's say you're a level 0. You don't get outside and never speak to people. It's fine, you're just not used to it. This means you need to wire your brain to handle such tasks by going outside to expose yourself. Don't immediately try and go to a party or something. Instead, just go for a walk with your dog (if you have one, otherwise just take a walk). It may feel a bit weird or even scary, but that's okay. Just keep doing it until you're comfortable. You know you're comfortable when you do it without thinking about it. Once you're comfortable with it, try to step it up. Go for a walk again but this time try to make eye contact with passerbys. Once you're comfortable with that, keep increasing your difficulty bit by bit. The idea is to always challenge yourself, but only by a small margin so you don't get overwhelmed. ## Step three: take risks now and then Nothing's feels as good as the feeling when you just overcame something you never thought you could. That's really just because we humans love noticable progress. It drives us to continue. Sometimes we need this motivation in order to make some big leaps forward. Let's say you've taken the first two steps to level up to level 35. You have now gained the ability to go to the store by yourself and make some friends at school. You look back at your progress and see a noticable difference. Your in a state of appreciation which I like to call a milestone. Use these milestones to take it a even bigger step further than you usually do. If you succeed, you will feel even better. If it doesn't, you learned from it and still gained a lot of experience because it's part of the learning curve. ## Conclusion Always make sure to up yourself just a tiny bit. Once you're comfortable with something. Add something else to it. Don't rush it. If you get in the shower and immediately put it on full heat, you will scream your eyes out. Instead, slowly add some more heat. Once you're comfortable with the current temperature, add more heat. If you happen to feel brave enough, take a small risk by adding a bit more heat than usual. It'll be a bit harder to deal with, but you're only stronger afterwards."
imzb4l,My family forces me to a collective sport. I will have tennis class every tuesday at 8pm. My family is proud of me... I am so anxious now T T
t7p35f, Just saw an advertisement for a mud obstacle course run. I've always wanted to run one but have no friends and when I did have family near me they're all out of shape anyways. At first I was somewhat interested in signing up alone but I started imagining how lonely it'd be and my thoughts were confirmed when I read a comment from someone saying they ran alone one time and everyone around them were in teams/friend groups laughing and chatting the entire time with one another and it made his experience feel boring as he had no one to root him on. Definitely don't have the social skills to make a friend there. I'm so tired of this. 
g3p3lva,"Wow, we are so similar because I have the same exact thoughts guilt and burden about wasting my early 20s and not feeling accomplished. I’m turning 23 in November (shudders) but I too have a very very sad resume. If it makes you feel slightly better, my only real work experience is being a dog walker and then one unpaid internship from 2018. Thanks to social anxiety and my parents sheltering me too much, I can’t help but be so embarrassed that a high schooler has a better employment record than me. I also can 100% relate to how you feel about wanting to do things and be productive but not wanting to deal with people, adulting, and basic responsibilities bc social anxiety/depression makes it that much harder. Now that I am unemployed because of the pandemic my future looks like even more of a giant black hole right now than it ever was before because I lack social skills AND technical skills. This has been my whole struggle since I’ve graduated college because I really don’t have any talent or a “rockstar” personality that will easily get me employed... I could go on but i feel less alone when reading your post and I’m sorry to hear you are going thru some issues with transitioning, lmk if it’s ok to PM you because I literally have no friends either. I’ve completely isolated myself since March so I am def open to being your friend or down to listen if you need someone to vent more"
k8243c," Gonna go to the beach today by myself. I just can’t spend today stuck inside my room. I’m really nervous, I know it’s gonna be packed, and I hate doing stuff alone cause I feel like a sociopathic loser, but at least I’ll get out of my room. I’ll put on my raybans and kick back and get some much needed natural vitamin d. "
5fplc8,"WHAT TO DO TO ACTUALLY GET BETTER (Two of my tips, and please share yours too). (english is not my first language, sorry, blablabla, but fuck it)nOk. I'm 22 now and had this fucking problem my whole life. it SUCKS, I think you all know it.nBut if you (still) want to find the magic effortless solution to it, let me say it right here: there is not. But that being said, should you just give up? Hell no!nComparing to a few years back, I'm already 10x better, but still not even close to how I want to eventually be.nSo how are some of my tips of something to actually DO about it, and that actually works. And please, if you are going to comment, share your tips too.nn1- (This one is not even hard, and probably the best one that helps a LOT, but you have to practice it) MINDFULLNESS MEDITATION.nI recommend downloading the app ""calm"" and doing the 7 day free exercises. It's a very good startnnNothing to do with spiritual/religious stuff. The basic concept is to just pay attention to what's happening right now (it can be your breath, your body sensations, the sound of the wind, the muscles you use while walking...anything!) just so your mind doesn't get caught with thousands of future/past worries, overthinking, judgment, etc.nnI recommend practicing everyday as an usual meditation (sitting, with your eyes closed) but eventually, and here is the important part, you will start to use it everywhere. not just sitting alone at your house.nhow it works: sit, close your eyes and try to pay attention to your breath. Sounds easy? it's not. but the important thing is: DON'T JUDGE YOUSELF. When you start thinking (and you will for sure), just acknowledge it and gently come back to the breath. If a noise distracts you (and it will), gently come back again to the breath. And repeat, repeat, repeat. You are not doing it wrong. There's no problem if you can't concentrate for more than a few seconds. Just know that you're doing your best and keep coming back to the breath, without judgment.nnOK, BUT HOW WILL IT HELP ME? With practice, you will start to get better at caughting thoughts that you don't want to think about. By doing the same thing, but in your routine, you will much easily realise when you start to overthink, or when you start to judge yourself, or when you start to worry. This meditation will show you that you don't need to go with the flow of EVERY thought that comes to your mind. (Did you know that you can just ""skip"" a negative thought? WOW!) You start to overthink about something, you notice it, and just come back to the present. It can be during a party, a job interview, a walk, a date, etc.nn2- (Much easier to say, but this is necessary) DO IT.nnOf course you know it. Everyone knows it. But it's the only way. Even if you meditate, go to a therapist, read reddit and tell this yourself everynight, eventually you will have to JUST DO IT. The result is NEVER as bad as you think it is, but the only way to show this to yourself is doing it.nThe main problem, of course, is overthinking. We think of so many catastrophic cenarious that we eventually just avoid it. But avoiding ALWAYS make it worse. Really.nSo what I recommend (as I said, so easy to say and so hard to do. I still have to work a lot with this issue also) is using the first tip (meditation) to help with overthinking, breathe in a few times, and do it. Don't try to challenge the overthinking with even more thinking!nnAlways try to go out of your comfort zone, even it's just a little bit. nReally, do it. Right now. What can you do RIGHT NOW that will be out of your comfort zone? Don't have to be anything crazy. Close your eyes, breath deeply a few times and do it. Scream out loud, open a facebook chat and say hi, go for a walk and say good morning to everyone you see. What is the worse that can happen?...NOPE. Don't think. Do it and find out. Do it. Do it. Do it. NOW. (I will too, so I dont be a hypocritical)nn3- Ok, just another quick one: EXERCISE.nnPhysical exercise is very good. Shutting yourself at your home is bad. Go for a run (I'm going for it right now). It works kinda as a meditation, that decrease your thinking, and also makes you feel much better after.nnHope this helps even a little bit. And please share any tips of stuff that we can actually DO day by day. We don't need to think about the problem, we already think too much.nnnn"
ptspks,"I have social anxiety and jealousy over people who have friends. How can I walk up to someone in my school and start a conversation with them/maybe befriend them.. I am 14 in high school and I have no friends. So like every time I want to walk up to someone I get this weird feeling in my stomach or somewhere around there and it usually happens when I am anxious about something so that's how I know I have social anxiety and also because I ALWAYS seem to overthink about how to start a conversation before walking to someone and I just think I may annoy them or its not the right time or I don't have enough time to talk to them because in school breaks there is 5-10 minute breaks so I feel like we won't have enough time to introduce myself and it would be akward I also feel like that when I leave the school and want to talk to someone as if its not the right time and place to talk to someone. I also have a fear of missing out (FOMO) so as if like I would be missing a lot of fun events and moments if I don't start to make friends now and feel like I haven't enjoyed my life as others from my school which have a lot of friends and this is also a problem cuz a lot of them don't really like me and I fear that they have told them that I am bad or something like that. For me it also tends to be easier to walk up to a person in my school when there is 1 person rather than 2,3 or 5 people there. So I really could just wish I could take like a magic pill that would make me stop feeling worried about how other people would perceive me if I walked up to them. I even feel anxious when I am just walking around and thinking that people are laughing at me when I can't know if they laughed at me or something else. I feel like I am subhuman compared to them and don't deserve a friendship I really want help with this but idk where to get it my psychiatrist doesn't do anything about it and I go there for depression which I also have which one factor could be what I just said above. And I already feel like I missed a lot of fun moments that I could have had in middle school where I didn't have any friends there either. My lack of friends is really putting me down and the only solution I know is to stay home and never go outside to look at people my age. I find it easier to talk to people on the internet but I can't find everyone's social media account from my school and there are no groups for my school where I could talk to them there online but I really wish there was. I really really want friends and the lack of them is making me sad."
qbyxe1, Missed sunrise because social anxiety. Saw sunrise for less than a minute till someone decided to come outside and also look at sunrise and speak to me. I went right back inside. Fuck this shit. 
jqmnkp," Motivation. I have no motivation to do anything. I’m 16 and I go to school but I don’t want to. I don’t study for anything because I don’t see the point. I come home, sleep or game, my parents wakes me up for dinner, forces me to get out to get some air. That’s my life, I do nothing all day and I hate myself. I’m skinny, depressed, ugly, I have social anxiety and I don’t sleep. I probably won’t get a job because I don’t do any assignments at all. I’m most likely going to kill myself but I need to find a way that the person that finds my body doesn’t get traumatized. I’m 16 btw so I can’t decide what I want and try to go pro. On top of everything I haven’t had human contact in over 3 years. Not a SINGLE hug or anything. I’m intelligent enough to know I’m awkward but not intelligent enough to not be awkward "
dkfkxgn," Thanks so much for replying to the questions. The fact that you can identify things that you value is really going to help you and make your progress much smoother. What is it you enjoy about your friends company? What would you say his best quality was? My friend, for example has a ridiculous knowledge of simpsons quotes that just makes me laugh because she can do perfect impressions of all the characters and she loves doing them. The long walk you mentioned sounds great, it's nice to hear and feel the nature sometimes and you get to stretch your legs at the same time. Ah I see what you mean. A week to overcome anxiety or reduce it to the point where it doesn't interfere with your life as much is an extreme example that would probably require 24 hour effort. But everybody is on a different spectrum of SA and it would be wrong for me to generalise how long it would take to overcome. "
65t70y," I think I might have social anxiety. My life has been a confusing mess the past few years. As a kid I was always good with making friends, and had no worries. Then as I turned 13, for some reason I started to care what others though of me, as in what I did, how I dressed, and who I would hang out with. As a result I tried to fit in, ditching all of my true friends. I then tried out for the basketball team, after practicing a lot only to mess up, and not make it. By this point no body wanted to hang out with me, and my friends I had before were already gone. I am now 17, and don't really have friends to hang out with, never had a relationship, and have tried multiple times to get a job, but failed miserably. I have no clue what I am going to do after graduation, and am very unsure about going to college, considering how sick I am of school. I'm just so afraid of fucking up my life all because of what I believe might be social anxiety. "
rnfc6r, Ideas for going out and doing things alone?. I wanna take myself on dates one and push myself to do things alone. Typically I normally take myself on scenic drives but never get out of the vehicle or anything. I want to do more stuff out in public. I think going to a movie theatre alone or sitting on the beach with a book could be a good start. I don’t really have the confidence to go sit and eat alone yet because I know that is a popular one. Does anyone have any good beginner ideas for me? 
e3ngql0," I'm about to start going to university in a month too and I am in the same exact position as you. Sometimes isolation feels good but most of the time I'm just feeling so disguisted of myself because I rarely crawl out of my room. Especially during summer it's horrible because the sun is out and everyone expects you to go out and have some fun and whatever. *I cannot wait for winter*. I'm sorry if my comment didn't help you out, I just wanted to say that I'm experiencing the same right now. Also, I hope you're having an anxiety-free day too and I love you "
eo0mi0b," Same, but I don't go to social events. When I'm outside I just try to be genuinely friendly to make up for my cold appearance. I'm not complaining. I don't really expect to make any friends this way, I just don't wanna make people uncomfortable because of my underlying anxiety. "
g75t3h1," I had so many nerves, totally dodged on a few dates with guys (don't do as I did). I started dating a guy a month or two ago. We did mini golf and went out to lunch after. We just tried finding a good outdoor activity to do because of covid. I was super nervous but I tried preparing what I could like what I was going to wear, where we were going, and tried to find some things in common we could talk about. Good news if he's an extrovert he may be more talkative and be easier to converse with. You'll be good! Hope it goes well "
lih2n6,"I just want to go for a walk. I want to be able to go for a simple walk without worrying about people looking at me, judging me, and thinking about how ugly or fat I am. I’ve let this hold me back so much in life. I’m 25 and feel like I’ve wasted years of my life."
pez1tk,"i feel i might be alone my entire life. i’m a male 22 and i feel i’m wasting my life away. i don’t really know why i’m typing this other than i need to rant. I have no career aspirations. i have no desire to chase a good job or money i’m completely fine with making very minimum money and living a frugal minimalistic lifestyle. i’ve been planning on traveling the country and living in my car soon because i love nature and i don’t like staying in the same place for very long so i figure living/traveling in my car for a while would be the perfect thing. My problem with this is i thinking this will make trying to form relationships even harder. so to put it all together if i ever meet someone and the freak chance that im not paralyzed from my social anxiety i get to tell them i have to career goals, i like not having money and i live in a car by choice. To me there doesn’t seem like a lot of people who will see that person and wouldn’t run away from them. And let’s say a find some who is exactly like me who loves all these things and shares my interests i have never been in a relationship, i have never kissed anyone. im terrified of sex and the longer i wait the more terrified i become. at my age i should have a least some experience but i have no experience in most things about life. I feel like im just going to procrastinate and live in fear and regret for the rest of my time alive."
g3grebd," Don't stop trying to be her friend. I met a few people who were talking with me daily and it felt comforting. I always didn't felt like talking and I was scared either way but it felt like I had someone there. But they eventually left me and found new friends. Try asking her to help you out with something or sit with her during lunch. Start slow and if she seems more comfortable invite her to hang out. I mean just for a walk somewhere. Nothing too social. Also one on one conversation always, we usually feel more safe. Just give her time, pay attention to what she is saying. Good luck. "
dx62dnz," oh my gosh, you are not alone. I am in the same boat. I work in a small office/retail store with just two other people (both male , I'm female) and it makes it rough because they know something is ""off"" about me because I never talk to them unless they speak first or when they ask me something. When I'm on free time and surfing the internet and of them walk by I immediately switch tabs and make myself look busy so they don't talk to me. I hate all of it. so much. I would do anything to be able to function like a healthy social human being. I want friends, I want to talk to my coworkers, but I just...can't. I get too scared. But you know what--today I told myself ""why am I so uptight? these guys are people like me, they have problems too. they're probably not as focused on me as I think. so why not be myself more?"" it helps a little. I think getting cozy in your own skin (being confident) and then learning that everyone is virtually the same inside (we all want attention and love) helps. Does that make sense? what kind of social situations does your job put you in? "
cvve57r," Pretty much what he said. Repetition, otherwise known as exposure therapy. It's hard but probably the best way to overcome your struggles. Giving less fucks, also difficult but definitely possible. What I'm doing to work on both of those is going longboarding. It was intimidating at first but now that I've gotten some skill it's gotten easier to go for a cruise around town. Showing down; also important. I view it more as sharpening my focus. It might sound lame, but something I do is imagine s bubble around someone's head. It honestly has helped me pick up on things that I can add to whatever they're saying. "
esg3s4w," Volunteer. I’m 22 and that’s one of my biggest regrets that I didn’t volunteer when I was younger. Try and find a re-curing role, like a few hours every week or every other week. There’s only positives. It’s gonna make getting a job a lot easier. They should be super nice and if they’re not you can just quit. When you’re volunteering it’s basically the opposite of a job, they should be trying to make you happy. It will help so much with SA and make it a lot easier when you get a job. Also, try and do some type of side hustle. Dog walking is a really good one, there’s websites you can sign up or make posters. Make something (like a bracelet) and sell it on Etsy... etc... Do both those things and you’ll be ahead of the majority of everyone else your age. "
fvrzv52,"For me at least I've found that getting the date and the first 15 mins of the first date are the hardest part. After that it's really not that bad, and honestly finding someone you really connect with and can share vulnerable things with feels good. We (people with SA) tend to be super guarded to protect ourselves from embarrassment, it's really nice to get into a serious relationship and have someone you can let your shields down around. As for advice I like to do activities for a first date, it's a lot less stressful to play mini golf or go on a hike with someone than it is to sit across a table face to face and talk since you have the distraction of the activity."
mtpqi2,"Dedication and Commitment in beating social anxiety. I am starting to really commit to beating social anxiety and setting it as the priority in my life. College is in the back of my mind right now and I am ok with that. I am lucky to be able to do this, my family is very generous and supports me financially. Beating social anxiety while also working a 9 to 5 job just sounds extremely hard. Since I am in this fortunate situation, why not practise relaxation techniques like muscle relaxation or deep breathing for several hours a day? I have been going outside for a few hours daily and just went in grocery stores, or crowded places. I have noticed that standing in lines and greeting cashiers has gotten easier. I talk louder on average. Sometimes I am surprised how strong my voice sounds even though I feel anxious. I am just sick of procrastinating and I really want to target the root of why my life is not that great. That is of course social anxiety. I am 20 years old now and super unhappy about that. I would like to beat social anxiety in about a year. I just don't want to find myself in a similar position like I am currently when I am 25 or so. But I know that exactly that would be absolutely possible if I dont try hard. Beating social anxiety is the only way to be happy. As cliche as it sounds, I really want to become an alpha male. Somebody who is confident, fun and reliable."
d4km0m3," This sounds... A LOT like the animal rescue centre I volunteer at. Like you, to pick up my confidence I applied there to help with walking the dogs one day, and cleaning out the cats the next. My first day walking the dogs was a disaster. There is often a problem with clear communication up at the centre... So when I turned up on my first day, I was told to do something else completely, and when I wound up walking a dog on my own, got scolded for letting the dog walk ahead of me (which I don't believe is a behaviour that needs rectifying), and all sorts. I ended up just not going back to walk the dogs at all since I couldn't stand the lack of clear communication and it sent my anxiety skyrocketing. I now just work with the cats instead. So I agree with everybody that it is not your fault in the slightest. It's unreasonable to expect a new volunteer to know every spoken and unspoken rule without actually having been taught them, and there is a certain way to teach volunteers the rules rather than just scolding them and being harsh about it. It's all on them. "
fwbbzu9," It can also be caused by this my friend. Studies supporting Nofap Feel free to add to this list in the comments. There are countless studies and resources confirming what we know from experience: porn is bad for you. Here's a small sampling of them. • ⁠Clearer thinking / Reduced 'brain fog' - Normalized acetylcholine levels: Pornography viewing has been shown to lower acetylcholine levels, a neurotransmitter vital for cognitive functioning. When cholinergic signaling is reduced, a subjective sense of 'brain fog' results. • ⁠Reduced sexual dysfunction - Dopamine receptor upregulation: The mesolimbic pathway of the central nervous system receives excitatory inputs from dopaminergic neurons throughout various other brain regions. Reduced dopaminergic signaling, resulting from pornography viewing, is thought to be the primary cause of pornography-induced erectile dysfunction. • ⁠^ Same study - shows that porn releases lots of dopamine which we know is an addictive chemical and one we gain a tolerance to quickly causing depletion and withdrawal ( same chemical as cocaine increases ). This tolerance / depletion causes anxiety, depression, lack of motivation and other things listed in the quote below. We know this from specific study’s done on drug addiction and the chemical..... DOPAMINE. On the next study I will provide proof of just how similar porn addiction is to drugs. • ⁠A quote from the study ⬇️ : • ⁠3.2. Internet Pornography as Supernormal Stimulus • ⁠Arguably, the most important development in the field of problematic sexual behavior is the way in which the Internet is influencing and facilitating compulsive sexual behavior [73]. Unlimited high-definition sexual videos streaming via “tube sites” are now free and widely accessible, 24 h a day via computers, tablets and smartphones, and it has been suggested that Internet pornography constitutes a supernormal stimulus, an exaggerated imitation of something our brains evolved to pursue because of its evolutionary salience [74,75]. Sexually explicit material has been around for a long time, but (1) video pornography is significantly more sexually arousing than other forms of pornography [76,77] or fantasy [78]; (2) novel sexual visuals have been shown to trigger greater arousal, faster ejaculation, and more semen and erection activity compared with familiar material, perhaps because attention to potential novel mates and arousal served reproductive fitness [75,79,80,81,82,83,84]; and (3) the ability to self-select material with ease makes Internet pornography more arousing than pre-selected collections [79]. A pornography user can maintain or heighten sexual arousal by instantly clicking to a novel scene, new video or never encountered genre. A 2015 study assessing Internet pornography’s effects on delay discounting (choosing immediate gratification over delayed rewards of greater value) states, “The constant novelty and primacy of sexual stimuli as particularly strong natural rewards make internet pornography a unique activator of the brain’s reward system. ... It is therefore important to treat pornography as a unique stimulus in reward, impulsivity, and addiction studies” [75] (pp. 1, 10). Novelty registers as salient, enhances reward value, and has lasting effects on motivation, learning and memory [85]. Like sexual motivation and the rewarding properties of sexual interaction, novelty is compelling because it triggers bursts of dopamine in regions of the brain strongly associated with reward and goal-directed behavior [66]. While compulsive Internet pornography users show stronger preference for novel sexual images than healthy controls, their dACC (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) also shows more rapid habituation to images than healthy controls [86], fueling the search for more novel sexual images. As co-author Voon explained about her team’s 2015 study on novelty and habituation in compulsive Internet pornography users, “The seemingly endless supply of novel sexual images available online [can feed an] addiction, making it more and more difficult to escape” [87]. Mesolimbic dopamine activity can also be enhanced by additional properties often associated with Internet pornography use such as, violation of expectations, anticipation of reward, and the act of seeking/surfing (as for Internet pornography) [88,89,90,91,92,93]. Anxiety, which has been shown to increase sexual arousal [89,94], may also accompany Internet pornography use. In short, Internet pornography offers all of these qualities, which register as salient, stimulate dopamine bursts, and enhance sexual arousal. • ⁠Alleviation of depression and anxiety symptoms ( + proof that porn has the same effects on the brain as drug addiction - See quote underneath the study ) - Regulation of multiple neurological pathways: Alterations in the functionality of many brain regions, particularly those related to the dopaminergic system, have been shown to induce hypersexual behaviour. Many of these same brain regions are thought to malfunction in the case of depressive disorders ( and we all know that anxiety is also caused by these same brain regions ). Abstinence from pornography viewing regulates these malfunctioning pathways: The Study: ^ This article discusses porn in several places. In the present review, we will summarize the neurobiological evidence that has accumulated on hypersexuality as well as on sexual arousal in general and excessive pornography consumption in particular. • ⁠A quote from the article ⬇️ ( shows the correlation between drug addiction and porn addiction) In terms of functional connectiv-ity, we found that participants who consumed more pornography showedless connectivity between the right caudate (where the volume was found to be smaller) and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). DLPFC is not only known to be involved in executive control functions but also known to be involved in cue reactivity to drugs. A specific disruption offunctional connectivity between DLPFC and caudate has likewise been reported in heroin-addicted participants (Wang et al., 2013) which makes the neural correlates of pornography similar to those in drug addiction. • ⁠3 week abstinence period - showed increase of testosterone: • ⁠""Relationship between Sexual Satiety and Brain Androgen Receptors"" Orgasm decreases androgen receptors in the brain. Androgen receptors are needed to use testosterone, with a decreased amount the free testosterone in the body cannot be used and there for goes to waste: *Aswell as increased oestrogen after ejaculating ( this is a female hormone which decreases testosterone even more ): • ⁠""Masturbation is associated with psychopathological and reproduction health conditions"": • ⁠""Sensation-seeking: Dopaminergic modulation and risk for psychopathology"" “…that higher sensation-seekers have both lower D2/D3 receptor density” - This is proven to have a direct affect on social anxiety ( Shown in study’s unrelated to nofap ) : • ⁠Substantial acute increase in prolactin following orgasm ( female hormone which is bad for testosterone): • ⁠Sexual arousal induces hypofrontality, impairing working memory and executive performance. “Pornographic Picture Processing Interferes With Working Memory Performance” • ⁠“The Impact of Sexual Arousal on Sexual Risk-Taking and Decision-Making in Men and Women” Lowers inhibitions and increases risky behavior • ⁠“Sexual Arousal Decreases the Functional Synchronization Between Cortical Areas in Young Men” • ⁠“Brain Structure and Functional Connectivity Associated With Pornography Consumption: The Brain on Porn” “We found a significant negative association between reported pornography hours per week and gray matter volume in the right caudate”, i.e., more porn associated with less gray matter: • ⁠“Craving Responses to Methamphetamine and Sexual Visual Cues in Individuals With Methamphetamine Use Disorder After Long-Term Drug Rehabilitation” “Additionally, our results illustrate […] that sexual demand might be more robust than drug demand[…]” This shows how powerful the effects of libido and pornographic desire really is: "
ncyqcd,"Lockdown making it worse. (F/20) Am I the only one who feels like being in lockdown only makes social anxiety worse? I always had social anxiety but I still kinda would fit with the people who where just introverted. I always had to think about if I really wanted to go to events and stuff, but it was manageable. Today my dad asked me to go to the car wash with him and I broke down in tears. It takes me so much to get out of the house. Friends keep asking me to take a walk with them, but i just can’t. Does anyone know how to cope with it?"
o63uhy,"I swim at a pool everyday and a lady is targeting and bullying me, this is personal hell. She has some kind of personal vendetta against me and has said some really mean shit in the pool in the past when I was lagging behind in the shared lane. Today she reported me to a lifeguard for swimming too slow for the lane we shared, while shouting that I did it on purpose and I'm ignorant and out to get her. A lot of hatred and anger for me when I've literally said zero words to the woman before this. She really thinks I did it on purpose. This is my personal nightmare and own little circle of hell, I have swimming tomorrow and I don't know what to do. How would you cope with being bullied as an adult. I'm 22 she's late forties"
f67s1b,"Question about medication?. Hey guys. So I’m 19 years old. I’ve tried just about everything else, including positive thinking. It hasn’t been useless, but for me it seems it can only do so much. I don’t enjoy life one bit and I look forward to the end of each day when I can just sleep. It’s getting the best of me, and it may sound like I’m not trying to get through it but I have been. It’s still very hard and when I’m trying to feel confident it feels like I’m just lying to myself. I dread going outside even though I want to. The times I do get out I’m uncomfortable and can’t enjoy myself. I know it sounds like I’m a pessimist and complainer, which I kind of am, but I’m in the least optimistic mood right now and I’m tired of putting in all my effort to feel positive when it just doesn’t stick. I’ve put in a lot of mental effort to get better, and I’ve had some good periods, but I always end back up where I am right now. I’ve made a lot of improvements over the years with going outside, getting a job, getting comfortable around people etc, but now it’s like it’s never happened because I’m back at square one and as anxious as ever. Anyway, I wanted to know if getting medication requires therapy alongside it. I took Lexapro a few years ago for a very short time and had a therapist. I stopped both, and I really would prefer not to have to see a therapist. I know they can be very helpful, but I just don’t want to deal with one again right now for my own reasons. Sorry if I seem like such a defeatist. I’m know I’m depressed and have been for a while and just writing this is embarrassing for me, but I feel like I’m at a dead end and I have nobody else in my life to talk to about this. I do have my mom, and she’s amazing, but she has a lot of her own mental problems that she’s absorbed in. Sorry if this seems long. I appreciate anyone who reads this and just figured I’d finally reach out to maybe hear from at least one other person out there."
dr9jl6," Helicopter parents and SA. The biggest reason for my SA is my parents. Aside from their hypercritism of me that gets me super anxious, I can think back on so many ridiculous helicopter parenting moments that have seriously stinted my social life and view on the world. To share a few: \-Not allowed to go to parties in high school because they argued only delinquents went to them and alcohol is too dangerous. \-Several moments where my dad would drop me off at social event (movie,dinner,etc) and he would warn me about crazy shit. For example: one time when he was dropping me off at a movie that I was going to see with friends he said: ""don't wait for me to pick you up outside the theater because you'll get stabbed"" The movie theater was part of a huge mall complex with hundreds of people, in a low crime rate neighborhood and it was BROAD DAY LIGHT. \-Not letting me go to the beach/cabin with friends because I could get nasty diseases and can drown. Now these sorts of things didn't necessarily lead to SA right away but they have isolated me and stinted my social skills. I get scared when I go outside because I feel like I'm in danger even when I know I'm perfectly safe. This sort of shit makes me isolate myself more which kills my social skills even more, both of which contribute to me SA. "
f237ki2,"I’m glad, I always hope I can be at least a little encouraging to my fellow anxiety friends. &lt;3 I remembered an analogy I was trying to think of how to explain while typing. A past counselor of mine told me to think of my habits like little rivers trickling through my mind. Every time I did something, it was like pouring water into the stream. Each time meant more and more water would be added, making the stream more powerful. It would start to wash away the riverbank day after day and suddenly one day I’d find myself standing next to a roaring rapids, wondering when it’d gotten so bad. How was I supposed to fight something like that? He said I didn’t have to fight it. I didn’t need to be strong enough to build a mighty dam that would stop the rapids, I just needed to divert the water to a new river. And so he gave me little things to do each day to get started. At first it felt like the new river would never compare to how deep my old habits were, but the more water I diverted into my new habits, the faster the old ones trickled out into nothing. I felt kind of weird sitting in this man’s office listening to him talk about brain rivers, but it ended up making a big difference for me. It really helped to think of my new good habits as taking water away from the old ones, bit by bit, and knowing that I didn’t need to suddenly be strong enough to dam off the bad habits as long as I kept working on the good ones."
dc7yen8," If walking your dog is an issue for you, going to class is going to be many times harder, in all likelihood. You may want to discuss your hesitance with your mom ( it sounds like you have a strong supportive relationship there) before taking the plunge to register for classes. After all, if you live in America anyway, college is a large financial commitment that you shouldn't make if you're not really ready. I dropped out of school twice due to crippling depression and anxiety, culminating in hospitalization. At this point I'm feeling much healthier, but I still have yet to face the financial consequences. Taking your dog for walks is a good start. I find that I'm comforted by wearing a baseball cap, large hoodie, and sunglasses when I go out for a walk. Even when people look at me, those physical barriers help me feel removed from their gaze. The responsibility of taking care of a pet might give you more confidence in other areas as well. Since dropping out, I got a part time job and have been mostly supporting myself financially since then (barring my untouched student debt :p), and that's helped me build my confidence significantly.

kvdtny," You're not on this world to be perfect. You are here to be happy. We worry so much about other people's opinion, about our flaws, our mistakes, about the fucking corona... All this shit ain't worth it. The world is your playground not your purgatory. The only thing you should worry about, is having a good time. That's all that matters. "
e5g5dz9," Np, also 1 more thing. When I said use technology as a tool, here’s an example. -You don’t have to delete everything, Although I would suggest deleting Instagram, Facebook, etc. because I can bet there’s nothing worth your time there- For Twitch, I unfollowed all the gaming streams and I followed 1 person who streamed content on how he built an app for the AppStore. For YouTube, I have 2 channels right now, 1 for my main stuff that I’ll sort out later. And the other 1 is for business YT channels (I want to be an entrepreneur). For Reddit, I have things I’m interested in (Hobbies) and overall things that will help me improve my life, Although Reddit is my worst vice I do waste my time scrolling and commenting on this sub specifically more than anything. The idea is to split the content up into different accounts, Stuff for Entertainment, Hobbies, Improvement, (Studying/Learning) and that’s about it. It’ll make it easier to be productive.

hbe4z5b," So, here is the hard truth. You either get over your social anxiety before you get called on, or get called on and deal with it then. If you have a close friend you feel comfortable around and can talk to about social anxiety. Go out with them and talk to people. Your friend will lead and you can into the conversation to. Even just saying hi will help. Let me give you an example. I am going for a walk. You see me, and think should I say hi, am I overthinking it? What if he thinks I am weird? But in reality, I have my own thoughts or was probably listening to music, I would have probably say hi, smile or wave and keep walking. I would have forgot about that, most people in your class will forget about your presentation as long as your “normal”, calm and collected. "
7awzce," Anxiety and Me. Rambles of a Restless Mind: I am now 24 years old and still tell myself my ""condition"" will get better as I get older. I can specifically remember being 18, on my way to exiting my teenage years and telling myself that my 20s will be different. So far, Ive been wrong. The same feelings remain. The gripping of my physical body by invisible forces continues, leaving me in a space much like that of the Sunken Place in ""Get Out"" as my mind continues to race on negatively to oblivion. The worst part about living this way is remembering the brief moments when the pain lifts and the sun shines brightly on ones soul, releasing you for an instant from the burden of your anxieties. When being social seems to flow so simply and you just go with the flow of life and everything is finally RIGHT... Then poof... The good times are gone and the self-loathing and agoraphobia come rushing back. You cherish those moments because you dont know when, or if, youll get a chance to experience those joyous feelings again. Its all in your head, they say. I know this. Thats the shittiest part about this affliction. I spend my days trying to understand what moments in my life sent me down this road, or if it stems from genetics but cannot pinpoint where ""I went wrong."" I have a brother who goes through life like a breeze. The same brother who tormented me growing up. I often think my issue is rooted in how much my brother and myself got along over the years which has been very, very little. The only thing we share, the only thing my brother felt we could come together on was music. If not for making music, I feel we would have never re-entered each others lives. I feel cheated because from my perspective, its been my brother that propelled the low self-esteem and self hatred in me. To only be accepted by my brother because of my ""talent"" only made me feel worse. The thing which I used to empty my thoughts on why I felt the way I felt was now being incringed upon and controlled by who could possibly be THEE REASON I feel the way I feel today. I know its stupid and unhealthy to blame another for how you feel but I will. I will because it was not me who would hurl insults at myself that were way more than making fun.. it was not me who would torment myself in front of others. I couldnt cause that kind of distress in myself. The kind of distress that you fall into unhealthy ways of coping over. The kind of distress you run away from, using instant gratification as a source for happy feelings. I couldnt traumatize myself enough to get stuck in a pattern of behaviours that only served to make the issue worsen over time. No. I couldnt do that. Knowing this, it gets hard when I read about natural selection and bullshit about strong and weak because in reality, we've all got the potential to become one or the other based on the environment we grow up in and the thoughts about ourselves which are positively or negatively reinforced. If you look at our American society today from the outside, youll see how much we praise the worst kinds of people. The kinds of people who torment others for their own pleasure, then turn around and ask ""whats wrong,"" after attacking the peace of mind of another. One can only take so much. Eventually you hit a wall, a point of no return of sorts, and accept the negatives about you. What you tell yourself begins to sound like what your attackers tell you about yourself and the journey on the road of social anxiety and little joy begins. Im caught between wanting to feel better and not caring about ever feeling better altogether. I know that, to the brain, thoughts are like exercise; the more you think about something the stronger the connections in your brain, pertaining to those thoughts, become. I am now 24, once again, and have had ample time to strengthen the worst parts of my brain due to negatively reinforced thoughts growing up. If you feel like I do, Im sorry you had to be subjected to prolonged treatments of negativity, causing you to form a pattern of negative thinking that youve been forced into. I know how hard it is to wake up every day wishing you did not, while those that exposed you to the negativity smile and laugh and have no problem ""being themselves."" Though we all feel alone, we are not. If no one ever reads this, oh well. I really just needed to relay some thoughts. The sad part is this is the only place I felt I could do that. I hope one day I can look back on this post from a heightened sense about myself. That would be a moment to behold. Till then, I wish you all the best on your own journeys. - some guy on the internet "
68egj5," Need some expert advice on what to do with myself.. Ok short points..... Goal- I want to have a social life/people to hang out with. Me- 25 ~nerdish 2 years of collage. mostly online. Area- Small town midwest. hometown 700, work city 2000 30min away, two other towns 13,000 1hr away one with small collage. 50,000 city 2hrs away. People- Very clan culture. People hang out with people they've know for most their lives or local extended family. so everyone knows everyone else. I feel that puts alot of pressure on someone who does not fit in and is not part of the clan. Social life- bars vfw's church lunches, ~80% old people stuff. Me not so cowboy hulk don't feel compelled to hang out with 60yo duffs. All my peers ether don't live in the area ie the 'big' town two hrs away. or hang out with all their high school friends. Meetup.com- Whats that... not round here. More about me- I adore going to work. Im in the office of a big plant and so I get to chat with some 30 other people (no peers) from various departments. ""on and off duty"". Im not going to go into the sob story of wishing I could hang out when everyone goes golfing bar hopping ect. I know having my only ""friends"" at work is sad but there it is. I think I am sociable, I have some work to do on conversational skills but I am usually the one to initiate. My life- My plan is to finish my degree in CS and move away in two years to start my life. (been stuck here for 16 years) I feel my life is slipping/wasting away and want to get some life behind me before I move. Between work and study I don't have a ton of time to waist hanging around little towns looking for someone to talk to in small towns venues. or driving half the day going to a bigger city to....shop? hit the casinos? The Question.... This eats me every day so some guidance would be much appreciated. A- Hang out with old people doing old people stuff? (would rather not) B- Forget about all this and focus on studys to eventually get out of here? C- Find time somehow to do something in a far off city? D- Find a way to move sooner? thanks any advice would help, I almost cry in the morning thinking about what a unstimulating god forsaken circle of dullness I live in. I want to improve my social skills and have a life, but the local area is the shits. "
fusqyg0,"1. That I have to filter everything I say because I’ve had a very depressing past and any “honest” answer I give during a conversation would be a genuine vibe killer, and always feeling like everyone else has a very complex but relatively happy background full of memories with friends and family. 2. To be accepted socially with people that I didn’t feel like everything is a competition with. It would be great to feel like not everyone went to lakes as kids, or got to read books as kids, or had parents who could afford TV, or especially who could afford hobby’s like sports or music."
de8qjki,"Socialization is only a part of human nature. Go hiking/hunting/fishing/anything with nature. As a modern human you have those needs/instincts that are neglected and unfulfilled because of your lifestyle. You live in an artificial environment which causes massive amounts of emotional stress but people dont realize that. Emotional stress causes physical stress and vice versa. Intelligent creatures need a a fulfilling ""job"" and mental stimulation(fun) and a desk job or browsing reddit will not cut it. To you or other people on this comment section this might sound dumb or insignificant but its the cold hard fact of being born in and living in ""modern"" society. "

foy99v5,"I think what men are referring to when they say social anxiety isn't a hindrance for women with dating is the fact that men are the one's expected to make the first move. As a man if you are too shy to make the first move you will never get a date so perhaps you could say that on average socially anxious men have a harder time dating than socially anxious women? I don't know. I'm a man so maybe that's why it seems that way to me. The grass is always greener on the other side. That said, I think it is foolish to say social anxiety isn't a hindrance in dating for women for the reasons you've already stated.nnFor what it's worth, if I am talking to a woman and she is very shy and has a hard time opening up and keeping a conversation going it's really no big deal to me. I can't speak for every man, but it doesn't make me lose interest. If I have to do 90% of the talking at first I will. Most people appreciate a good listener. I guess what I'm trying to say is don't give up! I have a really hard time dating too and it sucks and I'm sorry it's difficult for you."
nht0iw, I try to do at least something everyday. I won't stay at home even for one day. I don't do much against my social anxiety. But everyday I at least go for a walk in public surrounded by cars and people and most of the days grocery shopping. 
nqexgq,"Help please. I've always been shy but in last 2 years I've developed social anxiety. Becoming extreme social anxiety within the last 5ish months because of all these asian hate crimes.

cyws91," I am terrified that I have a mental disability or autism and nobody told me. Hi everyone, That's a vent that covers the thoughts I am dealing with every day that got particularly bad in the past three months. For some reason knowing that it's public makes it easier for me to put my thoughts into words than in private. I just turned 24. These days, I see almost no reason to live as I feel like my whole life everyone has been acting as if I am normal when I am really not. It infuriates me and at the same time isolates me because I don't trust anyone I know. Not my family, nobody would tell me the truth. Or maybe they would but I am scared to hear the truth. All throughout my childhood and adolescence I was the outcast, the weirdo and there were different stages of coping with it: trying to appease to others, being shy and avoiding social interactions all together in high school where I would spend all day playing MMORPGs. I believed to be quite skilled in music and languages (I speak 3 fluently but none as a native speaker) and thus excused my social difficulty with all the things that I *could* do. At the end of high school I'd convinced myself that I was weird just because I lacked experience with social situations. Thus, I started exposing myself to new situations. There was so much I just couldn't understand, be it movies, music, culture, books, politics or just what is going on in my friends' circles. I'd be just sitting with a group of friends and desperately try to follow their conversations. After a while I managed to give less fucks about what other people thought of me and started asking questions about almost everything I didn't understand. I wanted to catch up and make up for the countless hours I'd wasted on computer games, web surfing and porn. I had hoped I would eventually become someone you could genuinely have a fun time with. Then I started smoking weed and a whole new rabbit hole opened up. I would become paranoid in social situations. I became more attentive towards remarks by others. I would feel as if they are mocking me. I started questioning my intelligence. The anxiety would disappear a couple of days after the joint and I would go on with my everyday life. I smoked three months ago after a year long pause and it hit me in full force. I felt like the guy I was smoking with was entertaining himself with a retard. I am not sure if I am telling this myself but he might have called me ""slow"" while we were watching some videos. When stoned, my short-term memory practically becomes non-existent. I haven't recovered from this experience. I became way more self critical and looked for signs of a possible mental disability every day. I became more observant of my behavior and actively worked on it. For example, I noticed that I can't stick to a topic. I would grab onto a random thought that I associate with the current conversation and just digress. I looked at my Facebook chat history back in high school and died inside realizing how oblivious I was: not of subtle hints - I am talking about people giving up on me because I would give pretty stupid and irrelevant answers, resulting in conversations going nowhere. I've been trying to pay more attention at the body language of others as well as mine. I've spent a full year basically refurbishing the way I speak in my main languages. Now people ask me if I am a native speaker but after a couple of interactions realize that something is wrong and the conversation often dies. Back to now. No matter how much time I'd spend outdoors, I felt my progress was just not worth all my work and effort. In almost every social situation there would be a reminder of how far behind I was. I recently had a conversation with a nice older couple in a bar. I felt I was doing fairly well, we talked about the life in NYC, music, their youth. But I'd have to admit that it never was really interesting. I was just practicing my social skills. At the end of the evening, the lady gave me her number and encouraged me to message her in case I need *any* kind of help. She told me that I was so sweet and adorable, how she could be my mom and that *I would find an adult taking care of me*. That just ruined my night. Please tell me there is some ambiguity in her statement. The less shy I became over the years, the more obvious it became to me that the issue wasn't that I was an introvert. I just don't have anything to say. I can comment on a thought shared by my conversation partner but I almost NEVER bring up a new interesting thought myself (unless it is a useless digression). Also, I don't have an opinion on most things normal people would. I don't know what type of people, places or genre of music I like - either I do or I don't. I am indifferent about most things as if it would cost me too much energy to think about it. When I was younger, I liked to disagree with people I knew well about the most petty things just to feel superior and rebellious. I've tried to do the same with more advanced topics like politics but never really felt my arguments were effective. I probably didn't quite comprehend their arguments. But being a devil's advocate (a bad one at that) is not hard. I feel like a robot who is solely capable of picking out keywords from other people's comments and just shoots back a question. I've been told that I have a deadpan face and that my voice sounds sarcastic or bored. As already said, I am forgetful and constantly mentally exhausted: - I sleep 9 hours - I am feel the need to sleep more. - I sleep 10 hours - I feel like I became tired from sleeping too much. - I sleep 6 hours - I am barely conscious. I literally can't consciously point my attention at a task. If it doesn't come up naturally, I just can't solve a problem. If you are familiar with the System 1 and System 2 analogy in psychology (Kahneman), it feels as if I don't have a system 2. All this being said, I am about to graduate in computer science with quite a good GPA. But it's not because I am particularly good at coding. It's because I cram for the exams (thereby sacrificing everything else) and afterwards forget almost everything I learned. And we don't code much. The university system here is set up in a way that your whole grade for the course depends on just one final exam. The only graded component that requires creativity is a final 30 page paper. And I have no idea what I want to write about as there is no passion. I know I will somehow handle it but this doesn't solve my overall problem - I don't know who I am or where I am going. Also, I have 0 success with girls. I appear as a creep. I know that they sense my low self-esteem. Downloading Tinder opened my eyes. I assumed that I might have a weird character but that I am at least quite good looking - I got 3 likes in a month from unattractive girls - with tinder gold boosts. It's become so bad that when I see beautiful women on the street, I just become sad because I know there is no reason she would ever want be together with me. Funnily enough, I set Tinder to show me to men and I got a hundred likes from guys in two days. Maybe I am gay? I've been trying to figure this out as there are some signs of attraction but then again there is a thing such as homosexual OCD that makes you doubt your sexuality. This is such a bad timing. It is just too overwhelming to think about all these things at once. My siblings are so much younger than me but they are already surpassing me in social intelligence. I sense that one of them marrying will be a great further blow to my self-esteem. So in general, I suspect that I have mild autism, maybe ADD. It is so painful growing up convincing yourself that you are normal but then all of the sudden seeing everything in a different light and realizing that you might have been babysit by your friends and protected by your parents all the time. I don't feel close to the people I call friends at all even though I share quite a lot of my most private thoughts and they are incredibly understanding. 90% of the time, I am the guy who asks to hang out. And the friends I've lost over the years? Probably just didn't feel like putting up with my weirdness was worth their time. I know all this feels so self pitying and that there are people out there with objectively way worse problems. But doubting your whole life is quite painful. I know that the only thing for me to do right now is talk to a psychiatrist but this will take place in more than month. I am currently spending a month in NYC and burning so much cash because I wanted to experience the city that never sleeps. Well, I met many people that possibly made me realize how delusional I've been all my life and that my vague dreams will never come true. I still have to decide if that is money well spent. "
ekk81pv, I just dont know if there is anything to like about my self. I do play soccer im good at it. I dont know how to like my self 
exk2swg,"What if u just take it slow? Try being out there for 10 mins, then 20 mins, then 30 mins. Increase it each day u go outside and practice."
ekjog06,"I also really enjoy time on my own. Last year I went hiking for 3 days with some friends. I had a lot of blisters on my feet so I stayed behind a lot and walked alone for most of the time. But I really liked it. I was able to better take in my surroundings and focus on the nature around me. And from time totime I would catch up wit my mates, talk a bit and than lag behind again. Since that trip I have been thinking about doing the same route all alone again but it ain't very safe to go into nature alone for 3 days."
el7o052,"Yep, that is how I lost my only real girlfriend. One night while my group of friends was playing our favourite MMO someone announced that we should all go to a party on the beach. I declined and the rest of them logged off to go. She sends me a text asking if I was sure I didn't want to go. I didn't so I said so and then I realised/decided that we just couldn't work. I wasn't selfish enough to keep putting her in that a situation where she might have to choose me vs having fun while socialising. That was 12 years ago and I've been single since, partly because I still have that mindset."
5xz6cc," Really cool things can happen if you don't give up. Keep pushing there is something out there. Back Ground: 21 yr old male 5'11 185 lbs College student Struggling with social anxiety ever since 8th grade after heavy bullying. At one point it was so bad that Whenever someone talks to me i would freeze up and my mind would go black and i'll try to awkwardly utter something. That feel when can't go into the school lunch room alone because you have no one to sit with and you think people will judge you for sitting alone. That feel when there is a girl you like but can't muster the courage to talk to her. That feel when depressed because life feels stuck and doesn't seem like it's getting better. I've been all of that shit and more, during the last 2 years I have tremendous progress. One must make one realization. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN HAPPINESS. no one else will give it to you. You're gonna have to crawl through the mud to get over this shit. I started going to the gym, meditating, cleaning up my diet, reading books, lower frequency of masturbation, and most importantly of all when it comes to getting over social anxiety FORCE YOUR SELF TO TALK TO STRANGERS. Make it a goal to say hi to a stranger or introduce your self to someone randomly and try to make some small talk. You will have to look up how to do that like I did because I had no clue just like you. At least once if possible when ever you go out. It can be something simple like waving at someone passing by with a smile. But through starting conversations with a lot different strangers your mind eventually learns how to actually socialize. Besides all of that what I wanted to share is I've been in a slump as of late I've been trying my best to talk to people, ask out girls etc but with varying results. Trying to get people to hang out with me but they been busy. Girls flaking on dates that I was excited to go on to etc. Just on a downward trend. But I don't want to put you down with my negative situation. Today I was shopping for a uniform for my new job that I'm about to start. When I had an idea to buy a basketball to play around with at the mini basket ball court at my condominium. Since I haven't played basketball since I was in middle school, so I said why not. I bought the ball and excitedly headed home to fuck around and try to ease my mind by shooting some ball. So I was shooting around by myself for sometime trying out different types of shots. When I saw some kid throwing around a baseball near the court. Turned out he was a middle schooler although he was tall enough to look like he was in highschool or college. Anyways he was playing and I had the idea. What Could I do to break past my comfort zone right now? So I decided to ask him if he wanted to play some one on one. surprisingly he said yeah, so we played around for sometime. I was completely exhausted by the time we were done. We exchanged some pleasantries like good game etc and we parted ways. When I got home I was like holy shit, that felt really good. Maybe life isn't so bad after all. Maybe I can change, and maybe I can make a difference in other people's lives like I did today. If I didn't decide to buy the basketball and asked that guy if he wanted to play nothing would have ever happened. and my life would have remained the same. Stagnant and shit with no new things happening. Take action and something is bound to happen. If you are struggling with getting over social anxiety and general awkwardness like I am. It's a long fucking road but there are cool places you can sit and rest and just enjoy how far you have come. TLDR Take action and something will change. "
cf1lle," Seeing this girl. Hey guys. I’m pretty sure that I have social anxiety. Started realizing it around 8’th grade, when I started dating a girl from my class. I was never the one who made moves, I was too nervous and insecure. My lips get dry, my hands starts shaking and gets sweaty. It was horrible because I was so attracted to her, but I just couldn’t show it/turn it into action. This made me stay away from dating until a couple of years ago. I’ve met with like 3 girls from tinder since then. A couple of days ago I went for a walk with this really cute girl, and even though I was very nervous at first, it got better along the way. She wants to see me again which I’m really happy for, but I’m also a bit scared honestly. I’m 23 now, still a virgin and haven’t really kissed a girl before. I’ve had offers before, but I just never had the courage to do anything about it. I’m afraid that my lack of experience is going to ruin it for me. I know that she has been in a longer relationship before, so I think my lack of experience will be pretty obvious to her. We grew up in the same small village and know most of each others friends to some extend, which just makes it even more scary. Anyone of you with similar stories or advice on how to deal with this issue? Would love to hear what you think. "
l30ocz,"Does anyone else deal with anxiety flareups from walking outside alone? If so, do you have any tips for how to cope with it?. 22 F here. Every time I am outside alone, especially when it is dark out, my anxiety RAMPS up. To the point where I am afraid to be walking outside alone. I live in a city, so this could also be why it's worse. I get very socially anxious (feel like everybody is watching and judging me) and anxious of the worst things happening to me (getting kidnapped, punched, stalked, raped, etc). If anybody else also deals with this, how do you cope with it?"
euotl4o, Every comment felt like ...they are bursting out in frustration .. omfg ..... I will totally fucking stop it ....been outside I was subconsciously doing the same thing .... and then this post reminded me not to do .... And I fucking stopped .. Thank you guys ...... i can’t say sorry to the victims ...I really feel bad and I will definitely stop this. 
nhqp6i,"Hi there new member here. So , I just self diagnosed myself with social anxiety, cause I have a great fear of being judged. I'm an Indian 17 m Earlier, I was scared of being judged because of my skin colour, I was dark for a North Indian because of tanning by playing in afternoon sunlight. I got called names for being dark. Now,the puberty kicked in, I started taking care of my skin and body, and I just look like a average North Indian with wheatish complexion, straight hair, pink clean lips, broad shoulders. I am now not afraid of being judged by my skin complexion, IM AFRAID OF BEING JUDGED BECAUSE OF HAVING NO FRIENDS, the bullying really made me an asocial person with social anxiety, that's why I couldn't make any new friends after age 16. I go outside for a evening walk, I see people either talking to someone in person or on phone and I'm just walking alone without doing anything, I feel like every person walking near me, thinks how lonely I am and thinks how weird I would be, I always feel a lump feeling in my throat, when I see people talking to their friends and I just stand there doing nothing. The lockdown is really worsening my social anxiety and depression. Social anxiety made me cancel plan with friends, that's why I couldn't keep friends for long. Does anyone also feel anxiety, when walking alone on a road?"
715z2t,"Contemplating things.. Hopefully this makes sense here's my feelings. I really just need to vent all this shit out in my head. Social Anxiety. What a gift I'm gracious to be given. Every morning I dread to wake up of what you may ask? All the things I feel and do in a day Awkwardness, Silence, Tiredness, Forced Interactions, Being Fake, and more. Not to mention the Suicidal thoughts of how I could just ease away my pains and everything will all be over. But I'm to pussy to do it. How I wish this will all just stop. Like I guess one of my biggest issue is my Energy level. Doesn't matter if I sleep at 9pm, 12pm, or 4 am I'm literally always tired. I guess it's just a side affect of the depression. So, if I'm in a uncomfortable situation usually at school I just ""Escape"" even if I'm not tired I force myself to sleep. Not really sure if that can relate to anyone but it's a really shit feeling. Another thing that really bothers me is ""Normal People"" I can't say that I'm not jealous because I used to be a normal person myself. I think we all were. Looking back on my past I really wish I can just rewind. Like this condition is hell. I would never wish this upon anyone even the worst of the worst. I rather have cancer then this shit. Your body literally needs Social Interaction and this condition+others cock blocks you to the point you want to kill yourself from loneliness and depression. Really great. Another thing is people can sense right when you open your mouth if your worthy or not it's called First Impressions. You can kinda guess I fuck up all my interactions if any. But the worst feeling is when your actually trying your best to talk to someone and you know they have 0 interest in you or what your even saying. Like I have no words I rather you just fucking fake it to give me a boost of my confidence... like do people have hearts.. You Gave me another reason not to open my mouth. So, don't fucking ask why I'm quiet. Another funny thing is that people don't even know what to do with us anymore so they're giving up on us people with SA if it's people in day to day life not giving a damn or the Scientists trying to figure out how to stop this from even happening in the first place instead of fixing people that already have it. Source: My Life+Post on Reddit about this. Like I have no clue how this even works. Your not born with social anxiety. Right? Well that's what I believe anyway. Idk but this seems pretty fucked up. You've never had SA in your life and then comes along some traumatic experience that gives you SA and Now it's Impossible rid of it but you can only ""Work on it to make it better""... So, your literally scarred for life wow who could've guessed. Everything just keeps getting better and better. SA literally affects all standpoints of life. Your School, Work, and Hobbies. Like for an example I used to love playing baseball I'm pretty sure I started when I was 8 and I usually was the best player on my team. I'm left handed so I would throw with my left but bat with my right. Which is pretty rare. I used to travel all the time with Travel teams during the weekends to go to tournaments. Up until hs where first year of hs tried out and tbh I was out of shape and I took a year off baseball beforehand. The whole tryout experience was so awkward I didn't talk to anyone even some to of my friends that were. Idk I guess I didn't talk to them because there were other people other than my friends and I wasn't comfortable with them I guess. And then Boom I didn't make it. That embarrassing experience made me quit baseball and bury it along with any other sports I used to play. So you can check off that club off the list to join. Like to this day I would really like to know what my trigger was for SA. I was a really outgoing popular kid back then. Everyone knew me I had like 2 friend groups 1 was the Sport Popular group and the other were just Cool/Nerdy I guess if you would describe them. Now I'm in the same group I've been in for years and everybody that ""Knew me"" now knows I'm the quiet person. Hell it kills me one of my best friends that went to a different group in hs I can't even talk to him now. I just say like ""Hey, What's going on?"" and then he responds "" Dude how's it going I never see you around anymore"". Then awkward silence comes in to SAVE THE DAY. I don't even know where to start to improve myself I feel like I'm in a constant loop. My mom loves me and supports me so much but it kills her and stresses her out so much that she can't help me. Also, thought I should add this in. I do go to the gym well I used to but I'm recovering from surgery right now. I do take meds getting new ones right now idk the name and Zoloft had no effect on me 75 mg. I did therapy for a bit but I felt like it was just a waste of money and I did feel good going and talking but I never did the tasks and I felt like it was a burden and I wasn't improving by just talking. I also have real bad acne on my back and little patches spread around on my face and neck. I really want to take acutane or whatever it's called but my mother won't let me have it because of her experience with it. Running out of stuff to say. I guess that's good right. But finally one thing that I really have to get off my chest is My personality. I literally feel like I don't have one anymore. I feel like I can't make jokes or have a sense of humor. I don't know what I like anymore. I don't know if what I'm liking is just so I don't get judged by others. Like what sums this whole thing up is I just don't know. What is life. How can I live with this. The Anxiety. The Loneliness. The Depression. Life. And No it doesn't help to know that your going through the same thing. /endrant"
bgj37u," My head is so deep in the sand I think it's too late to pull it out.. It's gotten to the point where I straight up refuse to make plans or do anything, and I have been forcing myself to be OK with it. Like I have basically accepted the fact that I'll never date a girl again (after a fairly shit first relationship), because I've found that I'd rather avoid the horrible feeling of being uncomfortable/scared than get married one day. Or that I'd rather avoid the symptoms of anxiety than make friends. So I basically do nothing, because I think I'd rather do that. I do feel lonely, but I'd rather be lonely than experience the pain of facing my fears. My family is always telling me it's bad for my health and I need to do something, but for some reason I can't get myself to do it, because like I said, I'd rather be alone all my life over facing my anxiety. "
qfao9n,"Overcoming Physical Symptoms of Social Anxiety. Let me start this post by saving this is my first post on Reddit. I have been reading on here for years and so many of you have helped me in life so I want to return the favor. I have had social anxiety since I was in middle school. I’m 25 now and am completing my senior year of college. In a variety of social settings, I would experience increased heart rate, very noticeable facial sweating, blushing, shaky voice, trouble breathing, the whole nine yards. This has happened to me at work, school, with my own family, with friends. Situations that were of main concern include presentations, work, interviews, dates, hanging out with friends without being drunk, ect. Incredibly embarrassing and it sure does make you want to avoid being around people even when you’re feeling lonely. How irrational, right? Well a year or so into college, I started seeing a therapist and doing cognitive behavioral therapy, which did help some, but did not really do it for me. It was basically exposure to my fears and learning to change my thought patterns. He would have me stand up in front of him and give a presentation, and then add one more person to the room and do the same presentation. I only made it up to two people in the room lol but I DID feel a reduction in anxiety and increase in confidence. I also took a public speaking class (35 people in the class) but was only able to give presentations calmly by taking Xanax and propanoIol together. I just couldn’t risk embarrassing myself in front of all of those people. This combination worked wonders. One is for the physical symptoms of anxiety, and the other is for the mental symptoms (try it, it will work I promise!). I even faced my fears and got a job as a server at Chili’s which did help as well but did not fully diminish my fears of embarrassment. I’ve also tried SSRIs, weight lifting, running, meditation, yoga. SSRIs we’re terrible. The others did reduce anxiety and I still do them today, but attacks were still happening. What made me really get to a point of being CURED where I DO NOT consider myself to have social anxiety anymore, is what I really want to share. First, let me say that EVERYONE experiences social anxiety to some extent, even if it is very minimal. We all worry about how we look and sound to some degree. It’s just built into us, a survival mechanism. BUT, people with social anxiety amplify the anxiety by reassuring themselves that if their feared social situation did happen, the world would end, and all hope would be lost. And so they avoid it. They would just feel disappointment, and their reputation would be affected. And they are right to think that. These things may very well be true. But what I realized is this: so what? My story: It happened one day inside a guitar center believe it or not… I had to wait at a checkout with people behind me while they went to grab a keyboard stand from the back. They took forever and of course, that little thought popped up: “shit, I sure hope I don’t start sweating.” Sure enough, sweat started streaming down my face, sooooo much sweat. I was panicking and seconds felt like minutes. I felt so embarrassed and sooooo uncomfortable. I wanted it to end. But then I asked myself: What am I going to do, fight or flight? That’s what my body is preparing for right now. Screw it, I said to myself. I’m sweating, so what? Who cares? Nobody even said anything about it. The cashier acted as if nothing happened. And even if someone did notice or say something, I could just tell them I blush/sweat easily all the time, I could even say it happens randomly, especially when I’m stressed out. After that realization, I became completely calm in about 30 seconds. I still had sweat dripping off of me but the production of it stopped. I chose to not let it bother me. Ever since that day, it happened less and less. And each timed, I asked myself so what? I’m stressed out, it’s normal for this to happen. NOT caring if my worst fear DOES happen and remaining in that situation WHEN it happens (instead of running), is the cure to social anxiety! Fight or flight? It’s your choice. You have to continuously do this daily and you will notice it happens less and less often. Eventually the physical symptoms stopped happening, and I wouldn’t care if they did happen. I refuse to give them control of my life. The only thing I still struggle with is presentations in front of large groups (which I take medication for still). But I know one day I will have the courage to risk embarrassment for those too! I used to sweat/panic just getting a haircut, so I know how debilitating social anxiety can be. The switch of worrying to not caring will only happen when you experience the feared mental/physical anxiety DURING that situation and you REMAIN in it until calm. New neural pathways begin to form and each time you do not leave the situation, the pathway is deepened. Your ability to remain and decide in that anxious moment that whatever is happening is not as important as you overcoming social is the key here. It’s very important. Just like a muscle, it must be trained. Become a master at it. Bored? Go train. If I can do it, so can you. I know this post was long, but this is my story and my only wish is that this story helps spread the message that social anxiety IS curable, even in the most severe cases. Thanks for reading!"

ql97rq," To anymore who works from home or remotely online? Do you like the transition and flexibility or does it seem to fuel your SA?. I've been self employed working from home for over a month now, I love the transition and how flexible it is for me. Its impacted my mental health positively. I was a former hourly associate at Walmart, I left beause I'm not a people-person, I don't like having coworkers, managers telling me what to do, or customers yelling at me for things that are not my fault. I always wanted to work from home for myself, I work efficiently when I'm independent compared to groups. Now, I'm an Uber Eats bicycle delivery courier, plus as a secondary gig, I do online surveys on Qmee and Survey Junkie. But, I'm sure we all have different opinions. For those who are self employed or work remotely online from home, do you enjoy it or do you feel as if it feuls your SA? And what do you guys do for a living rn? What you want your dream career to be? "
c74lu0,My family is goin to meet some friends i havent talked to in years.. Im 15 and my family and i are in the town where we used to live. When we lived there i was about 9 when my parents became really good friends. They have kids and whenever both of our families got together i was expected to hang out with their kids. The thing is i never became good friends with them. They are all completely opposite of me and we have 0 things in common. And now were going to meet them at a lake tomorrow. The last time i met some old friends from the town was last year and i did not choose to see them again. When i tired talking to them and being friendly i got 0 replies back. Then i gave up and just sat by myself the whole time and thats exactly what i want to do tomorrow. Im sweating rn and i feel like crying. Im just really here to vent
e3hpk6l," I think it started a while ago. I've had an identity crisis my entire life. I grew up in Memphis with a large population of African Americans, as I am African American as well. when I was young I played sports on mostly African American teams. I wasn't bullied necessarily, but when you're a kid everyone makes fun of each other. I'm not sensitive and I never cared, but it just killed my self esteem. I didn't fit in with the other kids back then that well either. I was nerdy and into anime while most other kids weren't at the time. then I met kids who were into those things at school and I was friends with them. then I changed schools from public to private in 5th grade, where everyone already knew each other for years and I was the only black male in the grade. I won't deny that I was an annoying kid, loud and obnoxious, and many people didn't like me for it. the girls there hated me, the other kids never invited me to hang out outside of school. so I never really had that type of experience in middle school, which were probably the most formative years of a child's life. then my best friend moved back to Louisiana. then I went to another private school for high school to play baseball, the first school didn't have a team. didn't hang out with people then either. I was always socially anxious, never really knew what to say to people, I'm just quiet. sadly, after high school I didn't think I could survive in college because of the social life aspect. I was seriously thinking about killing myself because I didn't think I could handle having no social life in college. most of my better friends from high school went to colleges out of state or hours away. I had to move into an apartment with one associate (not a real friend) from high school and 2 other students I didn't know. I started smoking weed and surprisingly it opened up my social life. I met new people made some friends, strengthened some relationships with friends I had in high school that I didn't talk to very much until after. but my first semester was pathetic. I hardly did anything on weekends often either just smoking and lying down all day or going to my sister's or mother's apartments for the whole weekend. I felt pathetic about myself. and as a black man too, even worse. I'm an attractive guy, and people expect me to just be this amazing athlete, drowning in females. never had a girlfriend, hardly know any women, still today. around January 2017, I had realized that I love drugs, at least I love weed and other natural drugs and not harder ones which I don't want to partake in. then one night a friend from high school that played on the baseball team with me came home for Christmas break and we hung out. we found a dealer and each split a bar of xanax. that changed me a great deal. I was able to be more social, stop caring about what people think, and just live life. I had the greatest time of my life from January 2017 to about June/mid July 2017. then I had to prepare for moving to Texas and moved out of my apartment where I could have anyone over and stayed with my mother until I actually did move. friends stopped calling, stopped trying to hang out, I had to tell my mom where I was going, it was a very annoying setback. I didn't mind too much but it was the beginning of a decline in social activity. then I moved to a place where I know absolutely no one. never any plans, hard to make new friends especially with the amount of people who speak very little English (it's so so hard to connect with people who can't understand me and vice versa). I had to cope with this by smoking weed because it made me let go of my emotions and stop caring too much. now I'm dependent on weed and I don't think I can stop. then this last semester was a bit better (just like 2017). I met some people, made a couple friends here and there. but then every time we tried to make plans or do things, they would always fall through and nothing would happen leaving me to myself at home and nothing to do but smoke. then I was given advice and came to another realization that I can't really trust people because they are unreliable and people have so many different intentions and emotions run everything they do. one of the friends I thought I made had a plan to do something together at some activity with people he worked with. I had been suggesting for us all to do something and hang out, but that wasn't what I was expecting just yet. I meant to just go to someone's house and chill or something, I wasn't ready for that kind of large social gathering type thing. I did want to go because I was incredibly bored otherwise, but I also work every day of the week until 9 PM. and back then the NBA playoffs were going on. I never got a chance to watch any games because I had to work, so the one day there are multiple good games on tv was the same day as this activity thing. I told my friend I wanted to stay and watch basketball, he said ok. then come weeks later me and these guys make plans to see a movie in theater. the plans were made weeks before the movie would come out. the very day before going to the movie, the same friend with the work activity thing texted both of us and asked if we were still on for going to the movie, just to make sure. we both told him yes not even 5 minutes after he texted us. then what do you know, he goes to another movie and spends all the money he had so yet another plan fell through. and this didn't make sense because we had this plan for weeks, he asked if we were doing it, and we both said yes within 5 minutes of the question. that seemed like a real dick move to make. but I didn't really care anymore because at this point, I said fuck it and I just stop trusting people altogether because they are unreliable. idk I just hate my life "
isb9v5," do I have social anxiety or not? 17F. hello, I would really appreciate if you guys could give me an opinion on this. I have always been really shy and quiet but I have noticed that it has gotten really worse over the past few years. Before I used to be shy and nervous around people I didn't really know that well, or strangers but then I would eventually get comfortable. Now I get paranoid around my cousins and extended family. Also around people I've grown up with and know really well. I avoid eating in food courts and walking in public because I am scared that people will judge me based on how I walk or eat. I avoid walking down main roads because I'm scared of the people driving past and how they will judge me. I haven't celebrated my birthday with friends and family in five years because I hate being in the centre of attention even though I know its just my close friends. I hate leaving my house for walks or even just to take out the trash. If I do take out the trash I make sure I can't hear any car driving or anyone talking then I run back inside. I'm scared my neighbours will judge me somehow or want to start a conversation. I always think people are laughing or talking about me even though it's unrealistic to think that. I overthink everything I do such as walking, talking, eating. I also get very overwhelmed in social situations when I am suddenly at the centre of attention. My heart beats really fast and I feel like I am going to vomit. Sometimes I don't even like going in my backyard because our fences are really low and the neighbours can easily look over and judge me. I've lost friends because I've convinced myself they hate me and they think I'm weird by distancing myself from them. Am insecure or do I have social anxiety? Thank you "
ibutzv,"would like to unsubscribe from earth pls. I get so nervous to interact with people I’ll try my best to avoid them. I wait to see that none of my neighbors are outside before taking my dog out. When I was 15 I was so excited to turn 16 and finally get a job to start making money. I didn’t actually get a job until I was 18 because I was too scared to go to interviews so I never applied. Was excited about getting a license but that still hasn’t happened either🙃 I actually want to drop out of college because of the anxiety of going to classes and having to participate, group projects, presentations. Plus I’m a business major where it feels like it’s basically a requirement to be outgoing. Ive never talked about this with a doctor or anything so I don’t even know if there’s anything that can make me less scared of talking to people so please let me know."
g5lpr16, wow same!!! there's a small mountain just behind our school campus so I'd go there and relax whenever I need some alone time😌 
cz60ryb,"I was a shy kid, but never to the point it affected my life. I was a popular guy in middle school, ""dated"" all the hot chicks, and later in high school had a large circle of friends and acquaintances. I got laid at 17, went to parties and bonfires, life was great. Junior year I was at a party and was given Mad Hatter K2, smoked a shit ton of it and had a bad trip equal to an acid trip. The entire party laughed their asses off and I was humiliated and traumatized. I thought I was dying for hours. Fast forward a few years and I can't be around a group of people. I can't take being laughed at and mocked in front of others. Too many painful memories and flashbacks."
j1c0u8,"I get up at 5 am, every morning to go jogging.. I'm scared to jog in the day. But I really want to. I want sunlight. I go at 5am because I'm scared of people driving by and seeing me. I'm a grown man nearly 24. Why am I like this. My life has gone sour. My anxiety got better for a few years then it went to hell. A car passed me this morning. From behind. I took a corner on a street as soon as it happened. Saved some anxiety. I quit going down a certain street because somebody gets up for work in the morning and I don't want them to see me. I fear people thinking I'm weird. I don't know why. I fear they will say hey did you see that freak running. Who is he. Is he a crackhead. I'm fit. I'm a normal looking guy. Maybe even extra fit. I used to powerlift. Now I have no money and haven't been to the gym in nearly two years. 4 years if daily work gone. I just want to get this off my chest. I'm not normal. I want to be. I want to fix this. Weed used to help but I literally have no money what so ever and it's been like this since mid 2018. I want a job again. I want the gym again. I want a truck again. I want to be happy and less anxious again. And for God's sake I want to run in the day. Anyone know what to do? Does anyone else run n the day and have overcome this fear?"
f2xxxh," Apparently I’ve upset my neighbors. Early this morning I was outside having my coffee on the porch in my pjs (sweatpants and sweatshirt) as I always do. Phil across the street was pulling weeds in his lawn and this lady (don’t know her name) was walking by with the stroller and her dog as she always does. She stopped to speak to Phil, and Phil talks very loudly. She’s whispering and he responds “some people have no style or class”. My first instinct was oh great they’re talking about me. But I was able to calm down and realize that they likely weren’t. Then just now I walk down my driveway to get my mail and bring up my bins and see my neighbor out back, Ms M (who is in her pjs as well). She’s always been very kind and friendly to me. We aren’t friends but friendly neighbors who make small talk when we see each other and always at least wave. I see her look over to me and I wave and smile. She looks away. Ok figured maybe she didn’t see me wave before looking away. She looks again and I wave again... she looks away. So the rest of the 20ft to my mailbox, getting my mail, finagling the bins, and starting back up I know she has seen me. But she keeps on going even though I wave and smile a THIRD time. So I start crying while pulling my bins up. I’m so confused on what I did. My lawn is like it always is (not beautiful, but not a mess or violating city code) and has been for 5 years. There is no rubbish anywhere on my lawn nor any weeds. My vehicles are parked in my driveway as they always are. While I do have dogs and they do bark, I do my best to stop the barking when it starts, as I always have and it’s never been an issue. I don’t listen to loud music or tv. I never have guests over that could cause issues. There is literally nothing new or different either large or small. So I’m just hating myself for existing right now. If anyone has any tips for calming down, I would be incredibly grateful ❤️ "
djzf8v5, I don't believe that. Some people are just straight up more care free than others. They're in a yacht while people with social anxiety are in a dinky little row boat. 
f7cq889, If they are being friendly it means they already like you. The fact that you are making an effort shows them that you are interested so don't worry about it. I'd say the hard bit is over. Just keep doing what you are doing and everything will come natural. Leading up to the event distract yourself by doing activities. Sitting in your room dwelling on it us the worst idea. Maybe go out and go for a walk or something in the morning or day before or distract yourself with work or something. Overthinking it is pointless so stop yourself from doing it when you catch your thoughts drifting towards it. Make sure to distract yourself and on the day just do whatever feels natural to you. I'm sure it will go great Congratulations on doing the hard part as it is difficult with social anxiety. This is a good step in the right direction so keep it up 
nw2gbs," We’re getting a dog and I most certainly CAN wait.. My sister has officially manipulated my parents into getting us a dog and now because I’m the one who stays inside all day they’re expecting me to walk it!? I never fucking asked for a dog, and I’ve told them many times I’m not walking it. I don’t care if I start to like it and enjoy having it, I’m not walking around my village having to interact with people I haven’t spoken to in years and pretend I’m doing good. We already have a cat ffs, it’s gonna hate the dog. It makes me gag when I get a whiff of the cat food when I have to feed her, let alone picking up literal dogshit. I don’t know if I’m sounding like an asshole here, but in my head it makes sense that it should be my sister’s responsibility. Sure I don’t mind feeding the dog if I have to or letting it out in the garden occasionally, but apart from that I don’t know why it should be my problem when I never wanted it in the first place. "
fomtmjx, That’s literally the worst...another “surprise” is when you agreed to chill at the park (or something relaxed) and then after some time everyone decides that they want to go to a bar or club afterwards and I’m just sitting there and regretting my decision to go outside 
g3xzj30," same here, i just don't want to talk most of the time and people always expect you to. usually a cottage in the mountain sounds pretty nice during those situations. "
g49vgv4," I finnally gave up the video games. Skateboarding, something i always wanted to do but too poor to do, im pretty good at it now but overheard my dad and other family members saying that i suck ass when i first started out. Motorcycle riding as well but my dad tells me im a dumbass and im going to end up killing myself and to get a car instead. "
ocrpwu," How am I(20M) supposed to improve myself when I can't figure out what's wrong with me?. I've never had friends and I feel mentally exhausted trying to figure out why, I've always been dull and boring, every friendship I've had was of the most shallow, surface level kind, it's been like since as long as I can remember, no one around me either likes me or hates me, I'm always in that grey area where they just don't care about me, I was made fun of and teased in every school I changed, just this dark creature that comes into class and leaves, I'm so boring that I never even bonded with the kids that I spent most of my school life with, I'm abysmal at sports so no one ever wanted me in their teams and I was the only kid that was left out when selecting teams, even in petty playground games, I tried really hard to get better at soccer but I guess I must've some defect cause I never get better at anything I practice: sports, studies and even handwriting, I got scolded for bad handwriting even when I was practice for hours at home, whenever I went out to play soccer, the rest just made me the goalkeeper and all of my evening got wasted just seeing others play, if I didn't go out to play myself no one ever called me, they played by themselves or they only called me cause I had the ball. I'm embarrassed to even type this out but no one has ever respected me in my life ever, fuck, even kids half my age, I feel so humiliated typing this out but I really wanted to vent. I tried making a friend while playing online games and he never invited me, it was mostly one sided by me, it was the same when i tried making a friend on reddit, i don't blame him, but that guy never sent a message back after answering my pms, I met a 'friend' from years ago and he didn't seem happy at all to meet me, he sounded reluctant and wanting to leave the whole time and was like: ""just ask me whatever you called me to ask so i can answer it and get away from here"" I look back at myself and hate my past self, why was I so weird?, I never listened to songs, never liked dancing (still don't) and it was already too late when i realized i should get better at sports, one of my friends asked me: ""have you ever ran with your friends without a care in your mind?"" and i didn't have an answer to it, I feel like I've wasted the best years of my life childhood and teenage. I feel like an incel. I'm overly conscious when I talk or walk cause I've been told lots of times that I walk weird, I haven't been diagnosed yet but I relate to everything thats on r/depression and r/2meirl4meirl except I've never had suicidal tendencies , I've always had panic attacks on the inevitability of death but that's another topic. I'm not even exaggerating, but all of this hurt like help when typing it out, I feel humiliated and I'm cringing at myself, don't know if it's the anxiety but I've never had any social media accounts I forced myself to make this post. Don't know what the point of this was but this is like the tip of the iceberg of my problems, I could vent for hours more but I tried to keep this short hoping to get some advice. I've tried asking my friends what was wrong with me and they said that I was too naive and gullible, I've been told this by a lot of people that I'm ""too pure"" and too good for this world, I've never understood what this means and how not to be ""gullible"", I've heard these buzzwords ever since I was a kid by friends and family. I was anxious the whole night before my first day of college about these same things have happened to me, and guess what, that's what happened, the guy I started to hang out with the first two whole days went and sat far away from me and now we never talk. Sorry if this was too long or badly put together I'm frustrated and feel tired mentally and my minds been mush. "
fcwai8o, This is all very relatable. Best thing you can is learn to laugh at yourself. You can't change who you are. Also try not to dwell on bad social experiences. When you're feeling down distract yourself with something. For me that's working out or running. 
eiwtnym,"Cool so since I'm 20 I guess I have only six kiss free years left? AWESOME. CAN'T WAIT. Also: yay Netherlands. I'm a gal with anxiety but last November I really REALLY needed to see a musical in London because it was my last chance EVER, so I traveled by myself. It was pretty huge but considering the fact that two years ago I was afraid to bike to the city or take a bus, that's a lot. So yeah. Just wanna say I'm really glad you're doing so much better already:) Also please invite me to your wedding, I've never been to a wedding before because I only have two friends. Not joking. Baiii."
fzhgrnh,"Can she start off with volunteering or part-time/per-diem jobs, it might help her get used to working and be able to control her anxiety a little bit? I (20) volunteered at a few summer camps when I was 16-17 and have a few per-diem jobs right now."
dhxdssv," Great reply. Whether you think you love gaming or not we are evolved from the earth and it's being scientifically proven that connecting with nature and the physical world is very good for us on many deep levels. All these screen addictions may offer short term gratification and reprieve from the stress of socialising, but they are exacerbating the situation. The old ways are often the best for a reason. We took millions of years to evolve and we aint cut out for 24 hrs-a-day electromagnetic waves, messages, blue light etc etc. No wonder so many of us are feeling fried! "
f0qhumg, Maybe stay away from social media for a while. You could go camping or delete the apps for a while so you can't be tempted 
en0gdtj," Used to happen to me all the time as a kid. My family and I would go to the beach or the pool with all these friends and cousins and a bunch of people. They’d all go in the water except for me, I’d just sit on the towel on the sand under the umbrella and be perfectly happy that way, minus the constant badgering from everybody to go in the water and stop “ruining” the family outing. Before I was old enough to stay home by myself, my parents used to go to parties with loud pounding music and tons of people and they’d bring me along and I absolutely hated it. I would constantly ask to go back home but after a while this never worked so I just would try and find a “quiet” spot and sleep or something. May not seem like much but development-wise it messes you up as a kid. "
6dt9kr,"Cheep Chinese Beer cures my Anxiety. I'm an American 18 year old college rising sophomore. In the US, I was a dorm hermit and didn't get out much due to social anxiety. For the summer I decided to do a study abroad in China. As part of the summer program, I was required to live with a host family on the weekends. This of corse made my social anxiety act up something nasty, that is until the host family father brought me along to drink with his buddies. Now, being a straight laced hermit in the States, you can infer I've never drank before. Sitting on a river side eating smoking and drinking with a bunch of middle aged Chinese dudes, like cured me of my anxiety. Too bad I can't do this back in the States, guess my anxiety will come back upon returning home."
df75ugk," It's an annoying feeling right? I wish I was able to speak to people and not feel weird or nervous about what they think. I feel weird just saying simple greetings first, I usually respond and get the conversation going when someone asks me something first. I never could start one. Part of it I'd say is I feel that I have weird interests. For one I like things that are old and could never get into anything that is current, hyped, and everyone is doing until it is old and i grow into it on my own when it's irrelavent. When I watch TV, I watch reruns of old sitcoms and cartoons (and laugh even at the dumbest parts or during the audience laughter). I sometimes sit there and watch those mindless funny video compilation shows and stuff like impractical jokers. Many times i use the tv in the background while i'm working on hw. I sometimes even leave the news on all day, boring right? I love playing retro 2D style video games and can't really get into much 3D stuff I have no idea why. I love old computers too for some reason, I spend time opening game consoles and computers that don't work to see if i could fix them which 9 times out of 10 i dont. When I watch movies and shows that many people say are good like the walking dead, star wars, etc, or anything with a big focus on the story, I seem to doze off and lose focus during slow parts, daydream about things such as sitting with a girl or what i'm going to do after it finishes, find the show/movie boring, then fall asleep or do something else. I find reading boring and i instantly forget the last line i just read. I suck at sports and feel nervous playing with others. (In PE class during Middle &amp; High School I used to play basketball alone if we were allowed free time and once people started to join and play competitively I'd walk away and just walk around on the track which was another option for participation points. I was also made fun of during PE cause I sucked and sometimes made the team lose). I don't watch sports either as I find it boring to watch. I actually like watching commercials and know many of them. I go on wikipedia to search more about the things i like. I could sit on craigslist for hours looking for good deals that i could flip. For money i basically buy amazon sticks, jailbreak them for people who dont know how to and sell them for more. (It's not illegal, it's just like the fact that you could go to the car wash or wash your car at home.) I feel as if I have a very short attention span. I always feel as if I have a headache/tired when trying to pay attention to things i have to actually pay attention to like teachers in school, certain movies/series. Then I get sleepy. I do have nystagmus which is problems with my eyes and focusing that i was born with. This also prevents me from driving. I cant get interested in anything new, i'm always zoned out, daydreaming, even while doing hw and i end up pushing things to the last minute. I like going to amusement parks and getting on rides, I like getting in a pool and just relaxing. Or walking around outside with no purpose sometimes but then feeling weird walking around in circles especially if i see the same people sitting and talking. Sometimes i will just sit down or lay down and not do anything. Not even look at my phone, too embarrased to look at the things i like and others to pass by and make fun of it. And many more things i feel is not normal and others may think is boring. Despite me being shy and introverted, I have a youtube channel which is mostly videos i make about retro gaming and other random stuff. I find editing audio &amp; video fun. I like drawing still life images of objects, pixel art, and creating my own video games though i lack ideas and it seems like the stuff i make is a ripoff of something that already exists. "
90u00u,"Various social issues. Hello! I have been ""shy"" all my life and more recently I have had increasing difficulties speaking with people due to extreme anxiety. For example, I need to ask my boss a question at his desk. I will think over what I need to ask beforehand, and get nervous about it. I remind myself, ""it's no big deal"" and then proceed to walk over to his desk. I get his attention and start talking but as I am talking, I start to get nervous, forget how to form a sentence, get nervous that I am stumbling over the sentence/stuttering, get nervous that I am turning red which in turn makes me stumble even more, etc. At this point there's no hope for a conversation because I'm already in nervous mode/forgetting how to even talk. I don't remember having this problem until after high school (I'm 25 now).n  nMy second problem is with conversation flow. I have problems thinking of things to say to get the conversation going. Instead I end up with roadblocks. I do understand how to make a conversation flow with open-ended questions but I can never think of anything in the moment, probably due to nerves. I am also very self-centered, admittedly, so thinking about the other person's feelings is difficult for me. n  nMy third problem which is also a more recent issue is stuttering/stumbling on words because of memory issues, probably anxiety-related. I often struggle to form a coherent sentence, often forgetting what words to use. Then the nervousness sets in and it gets worse. Because I have this issue, I avoid conversation because I know it will come up and I will embarrass myself. When I'm talking I often look away from the person so I can think better. I have a very difficult time explaining things. Again, a more recent problem. I was always shy in school but never remember having these problems. n  nI made a friend at work so that ups my friend count to 2 (seriously). One of them used to be my best friend but we rarely hang out so I am often uptight around her and she even picked up on it. We don't really have much in common anymore and i feel I will probably lose her. I don't have a true best friend that I really get along with anymore. I do have a guy friend at work but I don't think it would be an option to hang out with him ever since he has a girlfriend. We get along really well and have a lot in common. I need/want to make more friends due to increasing loneliness and boredom but don't know where/how to find these relationships. My friend at work came to me instead of me seeking her out. n  nI have thought about going to a concert or cafe with live music playing to find friends. Maybe I could find them at a bar, but that's not my thing since I don't drink. I'm not in college, I don't go to church anymore, so those big social outlets aren't available. I play piano but that's a personal hobby and not something I could turn into a social opportunity, unless I start giving lessons (I'm actually giving my friend from work lessons). I don't have any kids to socialize with moms. I never had any interest in clubs or sports. I do like nature/hiking but can't really meet people through there unless I pay for a parks &amp; rec program.n  nA final note: I have tried medication but I don't like the way I am while taking them. And the various side effects. I have tried a few therapists but honestly I feel like I just need someone to talk to, a friend. When I make friends and have fulfilling experiences, I will truly be happy.n  nTl;dr This is mostly a rant but I am just in a funk trying to find friends as a 25y/o but can't find the opportunities and struggle with persistent nerves when speaking, which deters me from any progress. "
7biwk5," My life is spiralling. Hey everyone. I feel like such a failure right now. I live in Ireland am a 25 year old female and my life is pathetic...and I feel I am to blame. I have no motivation to do anything about it though, I am struggling to get out of the house and interact with people, I also have social anxiety. Just so you understand me better. I am extremely depressed at this point, it is so difficult because I took on a college course and I have hardly gone in, when I do go in nobody takes me serious cause I never turn up. I emailed the tutors weeks ago telling them I have been dealing with depression but am okay now, at that point I thought I would be once I just got a hold of myself...I ended up slipping back into a depressed state a few days later. I have now missed more classes and am humiliated at this point to contact them again and turn up, I feel like a joke. It is a school they are running not a hospital. The social aspect is crippling for me, I am finding it difficult to be around strangers in a store let alone making friends in college. I just want to hide away and not face people cause of what a failure I feel I am. I already told the student advisor at the beginning of the year to give me a chance to go to college this year again when I missed the last semester due to leaving an emotional abusive relationship after 6 years and told him I was doing better, I feel so guilty he really helped me to get into this year and I feel I have fucked it, and I have nobody to blame but myself. I did try to go to a student counselor for a few weeks, he told me all I seem to do is kill time, I talk about nothing relevant. I go to the gym at late hours and that is the reason I am being harassed. That I need to start going at normal hours and coming to college. He seemed to think this depression and social anxiety I have is all just a joke. I am beginning to think maybe I am just a joke and everyone should laugh at me. I have been on the same antidepressant celexa for 8 years now. I take 15 mg, I weaned myself down to 10 from 20 but after telling her my social issues, dr told me to go to 15. I am sick and tired of being dependent on an antidepressant, having no friends, and feeling like crap about myself. I feel trapped and don't see a way out of this. I just fuck up everything good and I was meant to add this girl for a group project a week and half ago but cause I stressed about it for over week and the project is due in 2 days, I feel like crap, my sister keeps saying add her. Nobody gets my pain shame embarrassment guilt anger towards myself for what a failure I feel. I can't do the simplest things without over thinking it to the point where it makes me feel I am going crazy. Maybe I need to change the antidepressant I don't know but my self worth, confidence everything is in the drain. I just feel like I need time out to sort myself out...but I don't know how "
my4bzb,"I am solving math problems to get out of my head.. I am outside seeing my neighbour, get self conscious, get aware of my akwardness and the downward spiral begins. So I asked myself: ""What is 23 plus 45"" You just can't be akward when your attention is somewhere completely else. Looking at people is not a bad tip either, but to be honest how akward would it be if I just looked at my neighbour for 5 seconds probably looking mad and not greeting? I came up with this method myself and it works reasonably well, I am just trying right now not to overly hype it, because there just is no simple trick for beating social anxiety."
f295pem," I was, but since I had a free day each Wednesday there was time to recover, be creative or go on a hike which was awesome and replenished my energy levels. Nowadays I have to tend to my family (parents mostly) on the weekends, so there's really almost no time left for myself alone. :/ "
doa7psp,"It's interesting because growing up I always thought social phobia was a lot more of an accurate term than social anxiety for me because it wasn't really anxiousness it was more my brain is telling me people are dangerous and I can't and won't expose myself to them. Reading about AvPD was like a breath of fresh air cause that meant there are other people like me. I'm glad that if this post helped you a little bit and helped you identify with a more clear goal!nnI actually don't experience normal fear/panic symptoms either and I'm pretty much exactly the way you describe. I used to be a lot more physically anxious back in middle school, but I think nowadays I experience more of dissociation or tensing or freezing up more than anything else. I feel like when I'm in a social setting, I'm not the me I am by myself, I have another personality. I kind of feel disoriented, like I'm walking around in an ""unreality"". None of my actions are natural to me. My thoughts kind of blank. I'll do anything to pull myself away from it, walk out of the room as I'm talking, as fast and as soon as possible. It's really weird. nnIt's funny you mention your close friend feeling like a stranger; that's exactly how I feel about my friend from high school. We used to share everything together and I found myself copying her personality naturally (that's something I just do I think to relate to people or make sure they like me; copy and mimic others' personalities). But then one day, it just became really hard to talk to her and I just couldn't respond anymore. These days I've withdrawn from everyone, even her.nnI've also been suicidal a few times, and for reasons I wasn't really sure of at the time, just that I was so miserable and didn't feel like I fit in or was meant to be here. Having this condition is really hard because people don't understand it and you can't explain it without being ostracized even more. nnI can also totally relate to the job thing. I've had more than 10 jobs and I'm only 25. People either end up bullying or teasing me or I get in trouble for not talking enough. I got a warning once because people were complaining about me having an ""attitude problem"" but I was just doing my best to stay out of the way and was quiet and didn't talk to anyone (this was at a sporting goods store, IDK what I expected). My coworker the other day straight up said he didn't like me because I didn't talk right in front of me and I thought we were getting alone fine. It was devastating. I try my best to be polite and happy to everyone and stay out of the way and when it fails it can be so discouraging. When people don't smile back at you, say hi back to you, or ignore or interrupt you, or complain about you, it's like WTF am I doing wrong? Why does everyone hate me so much? Why does it seem like everyone's secretly agreed to be awful to me? Why aren't people allowed to just be quiet and keep to themselves? Even strangers seem to be repelled. You start to hate yourself more and more and start to think that you deserve how people treat you. It's awful, debilitating, and life ruining.nnI would definitely bring it up to your therapist and do some research on it. nnFor me, I know exactly why I'm like this- I was being sexually abused and neglected at home growing up, and at school I was being bullied relentlessly. I've been conditioned to think other people aren't safe, and that's perfectly natural considering the circumstances. It sucks because now I have to undo all of that by myself just by trusting what other people, who have always been dangerous, say to me. "
ffdwji,"Do I Have Social Anxiety?. I get that talking to a therapist is probably a way better idea than asking the internet if I have a mental condition but this to me is a sort of first step. I am 15 years old and I have always been introverted my entire life. I do have a fair amount of friends at school that I love to death but most times i feel like my own company is all I need. But only a few years back I started really caring about being judged for being alone and stuff like that. At the moment I'm part of the school musical. At the first few rehearsals, I was excited and confident and social because my friends were part of it too, but slowly I noticed my social life started to fade. Whenever I talked to my friends, they would seem bored when they talked to me, only replying with ""ok"" and ""yep"" and ""alright"" and go off to talk to someone I barely knew and seem enthusiastic and engaged in their conversations, this made me extremely self conscious. Most people would make me feel like they were avoiding me, I was talking to two of my friends during rehearsal and they asked me to leave because they were ""talking about something personal"" when all they were doing was just gossiping. And the fact that they didn't even want me to join them would always get me overthinking. Stuff like this would lead to me aimlessly (and awkwardly) walking around the rehearsal room during breaks or sitting by myself on my phone, preferring not to socialise, always looking around for other people being antisocial so I wasn't the only one by them self, so it wouldn't feel like the entire world was staring at me for being the only one by them self. And if I pushed myself to talk to people, I'd have no idea what to talk about. I'd always ask my friends if I was boring to talk too. And even if they said no, it'd be so hard for me to believe them and if they said yes, even in a joking matter, it would hit me so hard. One time the cast of the School musical spent a night at a camp, and all the worries I explained made me feel so sick that I went home early after dinner and came back the next morning. I extremely hate family gatherings with a burning fucking passion. Every year my family would spend two weeks up a few hours north from where I live to this really beautiful place. What I seriously didn't like was all the relatives from my dads side all showing up. I would feel like I'm forced to be social with all these people that I barely have anything in common with (not even any of the kids my age) and would choke down desperate feelings of needing time alone or at least surrounding myself with people I'm familiar with. For the first few days I would hate the dinner parties and either hide in the bathroom or hide away in my own hotel room, and ignore the fact i'm missing out and remind myself of the feeling I get when I'm there. And in the next few days I would try to open up but end up following my sister (who is literally the opposite of me when it comes to her social life) nearly everywhere she went. The only time I felt like I could actually feel comfortable and be myself was when it was just my parents and my grandparents and my sister and literally no one else, having conversations. I am self conscious of everything that I wear. Part of me wants to stand out and be expressive while the other part of me wants to blend in and not be noticed but the biggest part of me just desperately doesn't want to be judged. If I showed my friends a shirt or a jacket that I liked and wanted. If they had the smallest pause or the slightest look it would send my mind racing. And if people give one stare at what I'm wearing I would just not stop caring about why they stared at my clothes for that one second. If people looked at me and laughed (even if it wasn't about me) it would immediately get me thinking ""they're laughing at what i'm wearing, they think i'm trying too hard, they think I look stupid in these jeans."". (also thank you so much that you've read this far and showed that you care, it means a lot to me) Like I said, I know asking the internet if I have a mental condition is probably not the best idea but I get the answer I'm looking for, I bet that I can get the confidence to talk to someone like a therapist or a psychiatrist."
db7j2w5," Wow, a much tougher read than what I was expecting. First off I want to say if you feel you are in danger please, please tell somebody, there are so many cases of children who feel powerless to their parents but in reality they are a front-door away from freedom. I can't speak for your mother more than I can speak for anyone else but it seems like she's pretty controlling, and that is *her* problem, not yours. Unfortunately that kind of makes you an easy target having SA; that being said you should mentally and physically step away from her as best you can. On your days off grab your board and just cruise, tell her your going to the park if that's what it takes. Coming from someone who also had family problems but in the opposite sense (coddling so much to the point of letting me sit in my room all day for weeks on end) I just couldn't handle the amount of laziness that stewed in my household, so one day I grabbed my sister's old longboard, my ipod and some headphones and just rode with no destination in mind. And doing that cleared my head soooo much. I think that is more important for you right now too, rather that focusing on getting friends or getting good are skating, becoming clear minded and focused will do you a heap of good for your self confidence. (There's an app called Headspace that I use all the time, it practices mindfulness and is incredibly beneficial for clearing your thoughts, I recommend this to anyone, whether they suffer from SA or not.) She suggested therapy, and even if it was a joke that's exactly what I suggest. It might be tough opening up in the beginning, it sure was for me, but after a while I think you will see the benefits. Having another person to get shit off your chest is almost a must when it comes to living in a first world country. I hate to kind of say this but it doesn't seem like she's happy being a mother, and that doesn't make for a fit parent, but you can use this to your advantage. In your head you can say she's a bad parent therefore she doesn't know who you truly are, the trouble is the amount of ""power"" she has over you, and I use quotations here because it's just an illusion of power. The only power she has is what you give her, and I don't know how old you are but you seem old enough to know bad parenting when you see it. My final thoughts are to spend more time away from her and out of the house, if that means spending more time alone than so be it, that gives you the opportunity to strengthen your mind and become someone else than what she's led you to believe. There's only two things in this world I deem as truth: follow the golden rule and time heals all wounds. There's only one thing stopping you from being the person you want to be, and that's yourself. Please man, if you ever want to talk to someone send me a private message and I'll send you my number, you sound like a good kid in a shitty situation, and that's not your fault! "
fkvggtm, I’ve started getting into bushcraft and identifying wild edible plants in my area - you know just in case lol. Today I went for a walk and spotted some silver berries and rose hips - all edible. If the pandemic was way worse I’d decide to migrate into the wilderness for a few months until the situation calms down. I’ve also been into growing some plants indoors!! Just some ideas - if you’re into that kind of thing. 
d68zzik,"First of all, we are on /r/socialanxiety for sure we are going to read it. That's just your anxiety talking and you trying to rationalize it. Don't let your anxiety win, what you write is just as worthy to read as anyone else. Right at this moment I'm feeling the same as you there but I just tell myself that's it's false, that you will read my comment too, or at least that my comment will worth something.nn&gt; I could ask someone a question, and they would straight up just pretend I never said anything. nnIt happens... I'm pretty sure you did it at least once because of your anxiety and it's not because you had any trouble with the other person.  Don't assume they did it because of you. Instead assume the best and believe that they just didn't hear you. You can repeat, ask if they heard you, etc... nn&gt; Also, at this school, when I was 17 years old, I experienced for the very first time a girl liking me. And I had no idea to handle it. This is going t sound stupid, but this is why I never made a move on her when she obviously liked me;nnWe all did that believe me. Once there was even a girl that asked me at 10 PM if I was interested in watching a movie with her in her bed in pajama. It took me a really long time to understands that she was clearly interested in me, that was her last resort move on me and still I couldn't see it.nn&gt;Â¬â€ I'm currently 21 years old, and I have yet to have a girlfriend. I haven't even had fucking sex. nnI'm 24 years old, never had a girlfriends either. Funnily enough I had sex for the first time a week ago, kissed a girl for the first time 2 months ago in a game of truth or dare. I have friends way older that never had sex either and I'm pretty sure that  there's older people here that can say the same. It's not important, it doesn't define you, it's just a thing, there's plenty of things that people never experienced and we aren't talking about theses. Why should sex be one?nn&gt; And if anyone does, and actually decide that the piece of shit I am deserves getting a commentnnYou aren't a piece of shit. Again that's your anxiety talking. You are a normal human being, you just live anxiety, which make it way harder for you to become social. That's like saying someone with a broken leg is a piece of shit because he walk slower. You can work on your anxiety and the same way I've seen people with a broken leg walk faster than me, you can also improve yourself and go through your anxiety. It won't happen in a day, it will be a long journey, but you can do it. I've started to work on it 2 years ago and I'm pretty good right now, even though I still have a ton of things to work through.nnWhat you need to do is to work on yourself first. You need to like yourself before hoping that anyone else love you. Finds hobbies, find what you love in life. You said you love movies, that's a good start, continue to watch them, go to movie theaters, go to special showings of movies you like, etc... Try sports, hiking, art, diy, board games, etc.. Go visit places, go to events near you, etc... Discover what you like and who you are.nnFrom there, start working on your social skills, use your hobbies to do it with peoples, but do it for the activity, not the people. You need to forget when you fail and concentrate on the positive things.  If it goes bad, who care, you enjoy that activity alone already and at least you tried. If it goes well, then you found someone to share an activity you like and more often than not, they will like similar activities than yours. Slowly build friendship from there. nnMy activity was to go to a local pub where we can play board games, in fact today it's been exactly 2 years I started to go there. Every week there is a werewolf game with a big group. It took me about a year before really feeling comfortable around them and starting to add them on Facebook. It then took months before we started to do things in group and months again before I was able to do activity 1 on 1 with them. It was never easy and believe me I doubted myself plenty of time, it's get easier though with time.nnStart small and don't expect any big improvement. It will take you a long time before being able to see that you improve but you will be. You need to push your anxiety, but don't do it too far. There's something that you want to do but your anxiety block you, try to do it, if you fail, see why and try to do it again. For example, I had to buy a shirt once, my anxiety was really hard, but I was still able to go to the shopping mall. I didn't do it but at least I did go out, it's a positive. The next day I went again and then I was able to. Both were big steps though but you can see the idea. You only fail when you stop trying.nnDon't forget there's therapist for that you, they can help you and there's medication that may make it way easier for you if it seems really too hard for you.nnI have no doubt you can do it by yourself. "
ejz3ajv," Yeah I was walking home from the shops one day (my anxiety is quite bad) and a Police van pulled up in front of me, I immediately crossed the road and one of the officers came across to speak too, I was actually very close to running just because I was starting to freak out, If i had ran I would of just got my self into a lot of unnessosry trouble because I looked like someone they were looking for. (I was not the person they were looking for) "
rzb5yn,"How do you guys deal with rude comments about your appearance?. As soon as I entered my teen years, I began this struggle with self esteem and hating the way I look, which hasn't ended now at 20 years old. Every day, I wear a full face of makeup, because that's how I feel the most confident. However, recently I felt comfortable to go out with nothing on my face. And of fucking course, some random people had to comment about it. I was just standing outside a cafe, waiting for my dad and avoiding eye contact (because it makes me uncomfortable). All of a sudden these two older men make eye contact with me. For context, school holidays hadn't started yet. Plus, without makeup on, I look a LOT younger, I have a bit of a baby face. They started loudly talking about how I was ""another stupid little girl putting her education on the line"" and how ""unfortunate it was that I was skipping school"" all these things, basically implying they thought I was a child skipping school. I wanted to say something so bad, but I could feel myself entering panic attack mode because everyone there was staring at me. It made me feel so bad about myself and I haven't shown my bare face since because I don't want people commenting about it. This isn't an isolated incident. I've been called fat by a random man before for wearing a crop top while jogging, and a dozen other negative incidents that would take too long to list. At the end of the day it feels overwhelming and makes me want to stay home all the time to avoid it. I can't just ""get over it"", my brain goes over and over every insult I've received. I feel even more anxious now even just walking around in public. Why can't they just ignore me if they don't like how I look? Why do they feel the need to put me on the spot like that? It often feels as though all people value you for as a young woman is the way you look."
flpifd8,"Mainly because of some abusive friends I had for several years growing up. They were the type of people who would get seriously pissed if they didn't get their way, and took it out on me (not physically), always arguing, blaming me for things, just generally making me feel worthless. And always had to do what they wanted, and if that included breaking my toys, taking them for themselves, or giving them away, then that was what we were doing. One of them would even kick me out if I did or said something they didn't like when I was visiting her house, and her rule was kind of ""You're annoying and stupid so you can stand outside *my* property until you get picked up in about three hours"". Her mom didn't even care when she did that. So those ""friends"", in addition to some bullying (which only started because of one of said ""friends"", they were after her and I was in the wrong place at the wrong time, so then they started bullying me instead for about 4 years, mainly bullying me about my interests and hobbies), and some other small stuff, just made me terrified of making mistakes, saying/doing the wrong thing, annoying people, scared of people looking at me and what they might be thinking about me, hating any form of attention... I stayed alone more and more, preferred to sit inside and read while others were out doing stuff. When I was younger I guess it was more just me becoming more introverted, but over time it escalated into social anxiety as well."
ea5fgot," Don't over think it. You both Are in school right. So that's already one thing you both have in common. Start from there. Then move into personal topics like ""what are you studying?"" Or talk about how the ocean is always moving. "
czrbfds,"Hey man I felt pretty much the same as you when I was about 16, thinking I needed to have my life put together with a plan and all that. Looking back, I'm 24 and I now see how young I was and that with time, things will change if you are persistent. If you are really worried about weight, try lifting weights or running/skating, something active that you can do regularly and enjoy a little bit. Even walking around the neighborhood for a good half hour is progress and will get your metabolism up. I know how hard it is to cut back on eating, and honestly if you work out consistently for a couple weeks you will start to be able to eat even more food, whatever you want, as long as you keep working out because it will burn off. Especially how fast your metabolism can get going when you are still young. I was cheated on when I was 16 and I know the ending of a relationship feels like the end of your love life forever when you are your age. Time heals wounds, just don't try to rush the pain away. I didn't get my license until I was 17, and I thought that was really old, but I know people that didn't start driving until they were even 18-19. I know it sucks not being able to drive, but I'm sure you will be able to afford driver's ed in a reasonable amount of time if you save for it. Do you have any retail or grocery stores near your house that you could walk/take the bus/carpool to? If so, you can get a part time job that you could save up for driver's ed. That will also get you out the house, and get you interacting with people, which sounds scary to people with SA, but after a week or so on the job I think you will come to appreciate it. Anyways, if you have any questions about anything, you can PM me and I'll try to answer ASAP. Good luck, and don't give up. Conscientiousness is a good trait when you learn to put it to good use, and it's something a lot of people lack. I hope you can learn to embrace who you are and gradually live a life that you are proud of. Take care."

dh6lsbd, I have heard that rock climbing is a really good sport for social anxiety. The hardest part is showing up though. 
dsk4xdo," I totally hear you dude, this is definitely not something you can just ""deal with, 'cause that's life."" This is something that's clearly distressing you to the point that you're willing to make MAJOR life choices to get away from it, and I feel where you're coming from man I really do. But please don't let this bar you from a degree/career path that you would otherwise want if it weren't for those damn class presentations. I think there are other steps you can take to remedy this without giving up altogether. One is talking with your professors about it. Not all will be sympathetic, but sometimes if public speaking isn't an essential component of the class then often professors will be willing to work out some alternative, like an alternative assignment or giving your presentation to them one on one. Though if you're not comfortable asking for accommodations I understand. Also have you tried any anxiety medications? It sounds like you have a lot of physical symptoms. Does your heart race? A lot of people who have performance anxiety get prescribed beta blockers, which prevent your heart from beating real fast and is supposedly good for keeping physical symptoms away. Or if it's more in your head, there's honestly a lot of good heavier duty stuff you can get prescribed to take ""as needed,"" where you can take it before class and it just gets you in this comfy haze where you're just saying the words you're supposed to say, reading your main points like you planned, just operating on cruise control. "
dddi4az,"Hope you're still reading the comments, I know i'm a lil late :)nn&gt; I barely know my local area and haven't done many things besides being a house-hermit and staying inside all the time; playing games, watching some tv and rarely leaving the house unless I'm actually forced out.nnFirstly, you can not live like this. Are you ""allowed"" outside? If you are, go outside. Go for a walk. Go for a 2 minute walk around where you live. When you feel more comfortable and brave, go for a 5 minute walk. Then 10. Then 20. Etc. If you're not allowed outside, freaking tell someone. That is not okay at your age. Curfew? Fine. Not allowed out at all? Nuh uh.nn&gt; either because I feel really awkward or simply because I almost never know what people are talking about due to my lack of knowledge on almost all topics. I often try to just joke about my awkwardness nnHey just listen to people. If you don't know what they're talking about, ask questions! Don't think about what you're going to say, just focus on actually hearing their words. It won't make you magically know what to say, but it will get you thinking about things other than yourself. If someones talking about something you don't understand then say ""hey what are you guys talking about actually I'm lost!"". Be polite. It's okay not to know what people are talking about.nnTry not to joke about your awkwardness or lack of social know-how, because it makes people feel a little bit awkward. If you stumble and end up doing it, it's okay, just move on! Cos you know what, everyones a bit socially awkward in some way, even if they hide it very well or seem very comfortable. Just like how I'm skilled in my job but still get anxious I'll get it wrong, or make stupid mistakes.nnPut. Yourself. Out. There!  Go out with the girl, if the only thing holding you back is social anxiety. Who cares about how your voice sounds? We're all different, we all have our silly stuff. nnIt's trial and error. It's baby steps."
gwiees,"ID photo shenanigans. So guess who got fucked up because of Corona? Me! I have achieved a new struggle - getting scared of crowds and strangers in very close proximity. I also can't do normal stuff expected of an 18 year old by myself (such as: interacting with strangers). Today I had to go with my dad and take a photo for my new ID card. Long story short: I cried like a baby like 2 times before entering the office because of the amount of people around me and because dad suggested that I might have to go in alone, then started crying again because the lady there joked with my dad that I could've come alone because I'm 18. (i asked to go outside to calm down and dad was amazing and very reassuring tho) So now I'll be cursed with a pic which portrays pure desperation for the next four? seven??? years. The best part tho is that it's legit the first time I don't feel ashamed for being a goddamn mess in a situation like this, I genuinely find it funny. Silver lining, I guess."
6qf4bp," Desperately Seeking Friends/Introduction. So I'm not exactly sure where to start... Introductions I suppose. I apologise in advance if I should be making this post elsewhere, and I would appreciate being told where I should be posting this if that is the case. This is my first post on Reddit. I'm a 20 year old male (Turned 20 in April of this year). I have Tourette's Syndrome (I like the nickname Twitch). I suffer from Severe Major Depression Disorder, Severe Anxiety, Severe Insomnia, and God knows what else. At this point in my life, I'm cripplingly desperate to break my social anxiety and make friends for once. I NEED friends. Some background on me... I started writing this tonight during a CA (Cocaine Anonymous) meeting in Arizona, where I now live. I came out here from Flint, Michigan on June 16th for a 30 day residential treatment program (Rehab), completely leaving my ""Comfort zone"" in just about every way possible. I've decided to stay and, basically, start a new life. I'm overwhelmed, depressed, anxious and feeling hopeless. I purposely cut EVERY. SINGLE. LAST. CONNECTION I had in Michigan except for my mother (Which was hardly any). I completed the rehab program and transitioned to a sober living house 2 Mondays ago. I have 7 roommates (all male). I got a job (that I absolutely CAN NOT stand, having no choice at the moment but to do it in order to pay weekly rent is DRASTICALLY intensifying my thoughts of suicide) at a temp agency last Friday, with the help of my roommates. I work with 4 of them doing labor, we carry heavy boxes up seemingly endless flights of stairs on random construction sites for 8+ hours a day in the sun and heat with little to no breaks. The ONLY upside to this job is the fact that we get paid daily. I started heavily using drugs when I was 17 in an effort to numb my anxiety and worries, and to suppress the memory(s?) of my entire life. I was too successful at doing this, to the point that I've erased my personality and who I WAS entirely. My parents went through a TERRIBLE divorce that started when I was 13 and ended when I was 16. They waged war against each other and used me and my 2 sisters as pawns. My father is a messed up, disgusting piece of trash. I've cut connections with him entirely. My mother is but the lesser of 2 evils. I've kept contact with her out of sheer necessity. I truly hate her, but I no longer show it. I was mentally, emotionally and physically abused by both of my parents my entire life. I was heavily sheltered as well. My mother is a pedophile and had sexual relations with my younger sister's first boyfriend, in middle school. A 7th grader. She completely forgot about me and my sisters and devoted her life and our money to this child for over 2 years. We no longer existed to my mother, we were nothing but punching bags for her during this time. This is the primary cause of my parent's divorce. After this child was out of the picture, my mother's current boyfriend (for 3 years now) took his place. He is everything and we are NOTHING to her, and he knows it as well. He takes full advantage of this. As a result of everything, I dropped out of highschool my junior year. My biggest mistake to date. I've gone back and forth between owning apartments for short periods of time and moving back in with my mother and her boyfriend since I was 17. My preferred drugs have been opiates (painkillers, preferably Heroin), benzos, meth, crack/coke, alcohol and weed. I've almost always mixed them all at once, ""Speedballing,"" if you will. It's a miracle that I'm still alive. What led me to rehab and where I am now was a chain of events that started roughly a week before my 20th birthday earlier this year. I was arrested and received a DUI that week. A couple weeks later, I was arrested for possession of marijuana. A couple weeks after that I was evicted from my apartment and I lost my job at GM. All of this managed to open my eyes and convinced me I needed to go to rehab. It may not seem like it, but this is a very, VERY short overview of things. I have omitted some extremely big and important details of my life for the sake of keeping this somewhat short. Back to the main reason for me writing this tonight. I NEED to learn how to make and keep friends. I crave this more than anything. I've NEVER had a true or close friend. I have horrible social anxiety. I've always been an introvert, I've NEVER been able to hold a conversation no matter how hard I've tried. I'm awkwardly silent whenever I find myself in social situations. I've had many chances since I've came to Arizona to change this and I've utterly failed every time, and these failures have caused me to close up even more. Whenever I have a chance, absolutely nothing comes to mind for me to talk about, everything just goes blank. My self esteem and confidence are at rock bottom. Thank you for taking the time to read this, I'm willing to take any and all advice offered to me, and I have no problem with making close and personal friends on here. I just need people to talk to. Thank you again. "
g3y7utc," I'll be seeing a psychologist soon and will probably be doing CBT. Can you let me know what to expect? I've been doing an online CBT course, and the things that I've done in it include controlled breathing, muscle relaxation, mindfulness meditation, as well as challenging unhelpful thoughts, and doing imagined exposure. I'm finding it hard to actually believe the helpful thoughts that I'm using to overcome my unhelpful thoughts though. You mentioned that you used to be house bound. I'm not that bad - I can go out for a walk or to the grocery store or the cinema or to buy fast food. But the idea of getting a job and interviewing etc scares the living hell out of me - are you there yet? "
93a5w3," Am I wasting my time with a therapist?. I got diagnosed with social anxiety a little over a month ago when I went in for ADHD and, it made sense because, throughout my life it’s been kind of just something I learned to live with but wanted to fix. I’m 24 and don’t really see a strong reason to improve my condition other than finding a girlfriend/wife at some point - but, that usually just happens on its own anyways. Can I just overcome social anxiety by putting myself in social situations? The therapy I’m going through has me practicing deep breaths, imagining an ideal setting if mountains oozing with ice cream and stuff like that. I think this is all childish and a bunch of stuff my therapist learned from yoga - I learned she does yoga religiously. I’m sure it’s to work towards getting to the end goal of being comfortable throwing myself in social situations but, I’m not totally against the idea of just biting the bullet and going out anyway. Is there any benefit to going to these therapy sessions or, is can I just self learn on improving my social anxiety? "

g40bpn3,"It's going to be alright, I felt the same exact way my first weeks of college last year. It started off for me very rough, I felt the same way you did and every day was torture to go through. My anxiety made things so much harder than it had to be... after about a month I couldn't take it anymore so when I got home that day I hid in the forest by my house and just cried for I dont know how long. I let everything out at the moment and afterwards I felt much better. From that day on things slowly started to improve. My mind just had to adapt to the new stressful situation known as college, your body is struggling to adapt but I promise it'll get better. You will improve and become more comfortable with college if you keep at it, I know it's hard right now but this will make you stronger. You are strong, you can make it through this initial hard time &lt;3 and if it ever becomes too much, it's fine to lighten your load, your mental health is far more important than any college degree."
nd524m," My struggle with Social Anxiety since finishing University. I have suffered from social anxiety for most of my life, but with the right support system in place in terms of family, friends and work I am doing so much better now. Due to all of this extra free time as a result of COVID restrictions, I thought I'd share my experiences with anxiety and how I stepped way out of my comfort zone to overcome it. I do have autism so apologies for the ramble/if this doesn't really make sense. I'm a 25 year old Assistant Architect working for a consultancy based in London, and I live within a house share in Central London. After graduating from Uni back in 2017 and facing the prospect of moving to London for work (where I didn't know anyone) I found this a very daunting a worrying time. My housemates were nice, but despite this I found it very hard to make friends, especially when away from the structure of uni. On my first day at work for the consultancy grad scheme I was placed with a mentor, Sarah, who was 3 years older than me and who had just finished the graduate scheme herself and it was her job to help me out/make sure I was settling in etc. Everyone at work was so lovely, yet for the first year or so I was very shy. Sarah was always so helpful and greeted me with a warm smile and a bubbly personality - she made sure that all was going ok within my work life, as well as my personal life. After a few work socials I opened up that I was quite shy and prone to panic attacks and she always made sure to check on how I was doing. I'm quite a big football fan and Sarah's boyfriend runs a 5-a side team on Tuesday nights so she made sure that I got involved and I got on well with her boyfriend and the team. Fast forward a few months and one Friday night during after work drinks I said that I was so fed up with being socially anxious and I just really wanted to step out of my comfort zone and Sarah suggested (this was after a pint or two!) if me and another friend from work would be interested in having a day out in London as friends. After some internal convincing I plucked up the courage and decided to go for the day out. We decided to go for a coffee/lunch and take a trip to Madame Tussauds (wax museum). As some background I also have abit of a stutter which can make me prone to panic attacks if it flares up particularly badly. When we were in the wax museum, Sarah could see that I was getting anxious/embarrassed and so (making sure the coast was clear) Sarah decided show her knickers and pose as the 'Class vs Ass' Breakfast at Tiffanys revamp and just with the shock of it, I burst out laughing and felt my anxiety disappear. Sarah said she wanted to show that everyone gets embarrassed from time to time, but that things will be ok and that there is always something more embarrassing that could happen! She made sure that I got an action shot before anyone else turned up. &amp;#x200B; I'm so glad that Sarah convinced me to go, she has been such a friendly face whilst I've been away from my parents/friends etc - I'm so grateful to call her and her boyfriend my good friends. Support from family and friends is so key to managing and overcoming anxiety. Just by giving someone a smile or asking if they are alright will honestly do so much more than you think. "
ak0uts,"Romance and nostalgia. I am so unbelievably lonely, yet I always dream of a miracle. Me laying in the grass, watching the stars, listening to music or talking.nnBut I know that will never happen. I feel like I am too romantic and nostalgic to ever find someone equal.nnI don't leave the house, I just listen to sad music and think of good times that have long passed.nnI cry a lot.nnMight end it soon, this is not bearable for my 18 year old small heart.nnThanks for reading."
mnl74i,"Do i(16M) have social anxiety or is it something else.. Currently I am in my final year in high school then going to college to do A levels. And currently by a few people who i am mutual with. Say that i am awkward due to the fact that i dont go out to start a conversation. This behavioral change probably happened when i was in the second year of high school due to a form of trauma. And further throughout the years events that have affected my mental health. Which were in correlation with this traumatic event and some not. Due to this i feel like everyone has something against me and they would rather have no connection between us. However these moments have seemed quite uncomfortable to be in as i feel like i should try to say something but i end up not doing so as i feel like there would be a form of judgement towards me. But even if i do try something, i feel good in the moment and then feel like i have ruined that persons life. During these times my social life with friends have been quite poor as i barely left the house. Which was about once a year with friends but this was due to a lack of motivation and me believing that i wouldnt enjoy it. Which was the oppisite when i did do something. However recently, I have been more willing to go outside with friends unless theyre doing something that i would not enjoy. And i have been more likely to talk to someone new but this was only the case if i didnt know about their existence previously. However, when i did do this. I started getting thoughts around the previous conversation i had with this person and how i may have made them uncomfortable. I also began to become more comfortable when answering questions in class after the last major lockdown."
encasz9," Dude, exactly. The one thing that has me really stuck is that I don't know where to start. Some people say stuff like join a club or just go to the park but like I don't even know where to join a club... Or if I go to the park I'll probably just feel awkward because I'll just be alone there walking around with nothing to do. "
flj2ogs," I have a robot personality as well. I wouldn't search the internet for personality. I feel like that's where I tried to find mine and it feels fake. Try to stay in silence for long periods of time. Idk if you are like this as well, but I always need background noise, (netflix, music, youtube). I found I get very bored and anxious without this background noise, but after a while your brain starts to wake up. I don't know the answer, but I'd say you should look for your personality in the real world. Like go on a hike. Hikes are nice especially when you get a trail all to yourself. It seems like it would suck at first but it becomes very relaxing and it wakes up your brain as well "
dorgg3t, Was there a point where you had hit rock bottom or how did you know you had to get help? A part time job would be better I think. Where I live I don't think there are much places where you can work part time. What part time job did you get? What sort of places hire part time workers? I used to do step counting walks and compete with myself but I find it so hard to go out for a walk now for fear of running into someone I might know. I do think exercise helped back then. I don't know how to start a conversation to talk to someone irl about it. What do you say to them. What's the part time job you love? Thanks so much for commenting. 
egu6gfi," I stayed in school till 18, did a year of college then a year of university, didn't really focus much on getting a job when I was younger cos I always had education in mind. I put uni on pause for like 8 months to focus on getting my finances in order and got a job, was supposed to rerun but my mental health went so so so low I just couldn't. I've been job hopping and kinda sofa surfing since. Ive honestly made such a mess of everything. Currently living with one of my parents. Left a job before Xmas cos panic attacks. Sounds SO pathetic I know 😪 trying to find another job but I've really no credibility at this point "
qc78xl," Nobody cares about the ""socially challenged"" as mental health problems are still stigmatised. I think I saw a similar post today so I appologise if this seems like a repost. About 2% of the world population suffer from social anxiety. That is way more people than some other problematic groups which are more mainstream and can get help more easily. Mental health issues are generally still stigmatised and social anxiety isn't different. We are ashamed of our problem, we try to hide it, not solve it/get better. And why not hide it? If you admit you have social anxiety - which is difficult on it's own because of... well, SA - there are usually two responses. First one being ""it's just in your head, you're fine, you're just a bit shy"". And the second one people will think there is something wrong with you, that you're weird and will avoid you instead of trying to help you. They should teach in school that it's ok to have SA or other mental health issues. That some people are ""socially challenged"" and that other need to accept them and try to help them in an appropriate way. Many time people try to ""help"" people with SA the wrong way, making everything even worse. Like forcing someone to talk in class is like throwing a kid eho doesn't know how to swim in a deep pool and expect him/her to learn. Also in our culture the awkward person who is always quiet is seen as a weirdo, an outcast and not as someone who needs help. Again with school example, the kid with no friends will be avoided or even mocked instead of trying to include him/her. Human are programmed to throw out such people from society instead of helping them. The human kind achieved many things and evolved over time, but still we have so many ancient instincts that we just can't get rid off. "
9brpda," Girl asked me to Winter Formal. I'm 15 and I've lived in Cincinnati, Orange County, Kansas, and Sacramento. There was this girl that I've known since 5th grade from my OC days and she thought I was really funny and stuff and I moved in 7th grade and basically lost contact until the end of freshman year and we talk a lot on FaceTime and Snapchat and she said that she was coming up to Sacramento, where I just moved, to play me in a tennis match and a couple days ago, she asked me if I was interested in going to the Winter Formal with her at her school which had me confused because she's an athletic, good-looking girl who easily could've gone with someone else. I was also confused because in middle school, I was this ugly unhygienic skinny Indian guy. She says I look way better mainly because I workout and play tennis and I'm super tall. Because of my lack of social skills, I don't know whether she wants to go as friends or as a date and every time I ask/tease her about it, she becomes defensive. &amp;#x200B; TL;DR: A girl whom I haven't talked to in a while asked me to the Winter Formal and is also visiting me upstate and I don't know if she likes me or not so I need guidance! "
egueivg,"Ugh, I love people who start conversations with me and are really sweet about it. I have no friends in uni and I can't get myself to talk to anyone without prompt, so I often feel like people avoid talking to me? Like they're scared?? Are quiet people off putting???nSo yeah, it's such a breath of fresh air for a socially anxious person when someone who is more outgoing starts talking to you.nAtleast for me, when someone initiates it makes it more comfortable for me to talk back and respond more naturally lol "
frpk060,"You will get there :) but yeah I do feel the same I'm 23 and had small cleaning job, dog walker and went to college and got a hnd in art and design which is what I want to get into unfortunately there is not any jobs for that in my area which sucks :("
41ukbe," What is SA stopping you from doing this week?. I've been thinking about going swimming. I've always liked water. Rain. Swimming. Maybe I'm hyping it up too much in my head though, probably am. I started going on walks(usually like 2 to 3 km) and (very slowly) started losing some weight but last few weeks I've been walking more often but don't seem to go down in weight any. That coupled with the fact that I like water/swimming made me think of going swimming a few times per week for exercise. It's supposedly tones pretty much your entire body too so that's good but.. Well sa i guess(and honestly a bit laziness and just general lack of energy to do anything at all). It costs like 8 or 9 bucks and I'd go to the exercise part for maybe an hour? Feels a bit expensive. Also I think I've been hyping it up too much in my head, it's not casual fun swimming and going under water and crap it's just trying to hold your head over water and..swimming. I have a poor body image too so not too excited about being more or less naked. But the main culprit for me not going is, you guessed it, people. Specifically the amount of people in the exercise pool. There are maybe 5 or 6 ""lanes"" and I'd really prefer to be alone in one. I'd hate to be 2 or ugh more in one lane. And swim faster/slower depending on the other people in your lane. And eventually swimming past eachother and sometimes accidentally hitting eachother. I wish it was as easy to swim completely alone as it is to go for a walk completely alone. Since I kinda want to go swim but ""cant"" I feel a bit down and just.. don't feel like doing anything. Meh been typing forever. So.. what is it you're not doing cus of sa? "
j4hr9q," Bars in my city have to close at 10pm now and it makes going out harder for me.. I have social anxiety but I'm able to manage it while still seeing my friends if I go out and don't stay too late, so normally 10pm would be around the time I'd go home whereas my friends might stay until the bar closes at 1am. I don't like being out later than that because I don't drink and it gets boring but also because there are more drunk people, more people in general and I feel really anxious/unsafe, whereas if I go home at 10pm it's normally fine. But now because there are more COVID-19 cases where I live all the bars have to close at 10pm, and it just means that 10pm is the new after-midnight. You can normally avoid the big drinking culture in my city (due to being in Europe and having lots of college students haha) by going home before a certain time but now it starts three or four hours early. I went to meet my friends after finishing class yesterday evening and stayed until closing and it was horrible, it was really crowded and random people without masks kept coming to our \[outside\] table asking for money or cigarettes or sometimes just being weird in general. The bus home at 10pm felt like an actual night bus. This guy starting being threatening and saying homophobic stuff to me but luckily my friend defended me and nothing serious happened but it made me sad because I moved countries to be somewhere that I thought was safer. Honestly it's so upsetting, I feel like I can't go out in the evenings anymore, when I finish class the bars are already crowded and people are already drunk because they go out earlier... but it's recommended to socialise outside and keep a distance because of the virus and you can do that with the outdoors seating in bars. :( "
fn9kod,"How do I stop self sabotage PLS HELPLOL. I think a lot of people see me as confident and maybe a little conceited even. I am tan, skinny, blonde hair that almost touched my butt- I get a lot of attention anywhere I go based of my looks However I am very very insecure. I spend thousands on my hair a year. I spray tan in the winter like it’s my gotdamn job. Aaaand my biggest secret I have struggled with severe anorexia in the past (no one knows about it) I hide when I don’t look good. If I feel ugly I feel like I am disappointing. I feel like I have a rep of being Barbie, and I identify with it. If I go out looking like crap I don’t even have a good personality, bc I feel so terrible. I have 4 different friends inviting me to hangout tonight and I want to see all of them, but I feel so ugly right now. I don’t look like myself at ALL and I know that if I go out I will be so self-conscious the whole time I will not be fun to be around. Idk what to do, I hate losing friends over this. I am 20 years old and always had plenty of friends- still have never been to a pool party. Always bail when I feel ugly. No guy has ever not liked my body, girls ask me how I get my body- but I secretly am so insecure about it (and everything)"
7irud6," 21 years old, senior in university, and I've never had any friends, ever. Among other problems, I don't plan to live past my graduation.. I have never had any friends, and I never will. I don't have anybody. I'm all alone. Imagine your whole life without any friends. Growing up, I've never played with anyone on the playground. I never went to anybody's house or had sleep overs. In high school, I had no one to hang out with. I always sat alone during lunch, if I even ate lunch. I've never been in anybody else's car other than my family's. I've never gone over to a friend's house. And nobody has ever came over to mine. Every moment and memory that you have that has included a friend, get rid of it. That's me. All I ever do, and pretty much all I've ever done is go to school and come back to my house/apartment. I immediately go to my classes, and come back. I don't really talk to anyone. No one really knows me. I'm not in any activities, clubs, or organizations. Once I'm in my room, I don't accomplish anything. Outside of homework, I just stare at my ceiling, my phone, or my laptop. Since I'm in a large university, I'm pathetic beyond reasoning. Whenever one of my roommates bring one of their friends over, I end up crying alone in my room, because I will never have that. I will never have anyone. I've tried befriending the roommates, but they don't include me anything. They probably know how horribly messed up of a person I am. And it's all because of me. I have severe anxieties that keep me from functioning as a normal person. The biggest part is my Avoidant Personality disorder that prevents me from doing the things I would otherwise want. Along with depression, other anxieties, panic attacks, fears, etc, I can never get close to people. No amount of therapy or meds will help because it's too ingrained in me. These problems effect more than just friends. I won't ever be able to do an interview, and so I'll never be able to work. And if I do ever get a job, I will never be able to hold on. My life has been awful. And it won't get better. My only option is to end myself at the end of my college. I probably won't even make it to my graduation. "
osqpy1,"I’m 16 and can’t ride a bike. When I was younger maybe 10 or 11 all of my friends and classmates knew how to ride a bike, except me. So my dad decided to teach me with training wheels. We were at my neighborhood park and it was going pretty well, my dad was explaining the basics while I was getting used to the bike. 30 minutes in my dad had to throw out some trash, the nearest trash can was on the other side of this field. (The center of this park is just grass, and around it in an oval shape is the path). He lets me know he’s going to go throw something out and told me to keep practicing. As I’m minding my own business this group of guys walking past me start making fun of me for needing training wheels. My dad wasn’t anywhere near me and these guys looked like they were 20. I don’t remember what they said exactly but it must’ve messed me up pretty badly because when my dad got back I told him I wanted to go home because I was “tired”. I haven’t been on a bike since, I want to learn but just the thought makes me feel nauseous. My parents, brother, cousins, and aunt keep trying to get me to learn but I always refuse. I’ve never told them why so they probably just think I’m lazy or a shut in. This happened about 5 years ago and only lasted a few short seconds, so why does it still affect me so much that I can’t even get on a bike?"
ojvf8j,"My struggles with my anxiety. Sorry its so long... I think one of the major reasons I struggle so much with my anxiety is because I'm not able to see the bigger picture of situations and instead hyper-focus on every little detail and attribute meaning to it Someone can just look away or yawn during a conversation and I'll beat myself up like ""was I boring them"" or ""I should just stop talking"". I know I shouldn't care what other think of me but I do, and I don't really know how not to. I honestly don't know why I'm like this. My family are complete extroverts and I am too when I with them alone. But the second I'm in public I lose all ability to be ""normal"". I don't have witty one-liners, I cant have small talk with someone in an elevator (matter of fact I avoid eye contact all together), I can't make awkward situations less awkward (I'd make them painfully more awkward by staying silent because I don't want to say the wrong thing) and I definitely cant make friends easily because, again I don't know how to talk. I think so much about what I'm going to say when someone puts me on the spot that I stutter after every word. I have to think of every way I can respond and I try to say of them all at once, while still thinking of more ways to respond. It's especially harder when you see everyone around you has the ability talk causally and effortlessly and your are the one person who can't formulate a sentence. As a college student, I'm surrounded and I mean surrounded by extraverts, mainly because of the subject I'm studying (Healthcare), and I stick out for being quiet which sucks! I don't know how many times people have commented on it as if i wasn't already aware of it. ""You should speak up more"" Yeah lol if only it was that easy. Sadly I have this mindset: ""If I don't say anything, I wont say something stupid and embarrass myself, and then I won't have anything to beat myself up over"" which needless to say has only caused me to isolate myself more. I feel like I miss out on alot because of my social anxiety. Not being the typical college student makes me feel like there's something wrong with me. I really do try to speak, and I try to fit into the mold but it feels like I'm trying to trying to move a boulder up a hill because I'm trying to be someone I'm not. I also think my grief comes from me not accepting the fact that I have social anxiety. I want to think of myself as ""normal"" and I want to fit in and especially don't want to be weird. I can pretend to an extent in certain situation (like talking to the cashier at the store while buying something) but it's only for very very short periods of time. And I basically have to become a different person to even do that much. I cringe at myself so hard sometimes, and the voice in my head is like, ""how hard is it to be normal, all theses other people are fine whats wrong with you?"" and I replay basically every situation a thousand times in my head, hating myself more and more with every rerun. I'm 20 now and I feel like if I don't try harder to socialize now I'll regret it later but its hard since when I do talk I feel like I'm waring a mask and just putting on a show rather than being myself."
qaplek,"Feeling really down. Hi! First post here. (18m) I’ll try to make this short. So today while i was walking home from school minding my own business i felt like i was constantly being stared at. To top it off, as i was walking past a group of people, they all turned to face me and stared me down. One even said something along the lines of ”guys don’t stare too much”. I tried my best to ignore them and looked like i didn’t notice but deep down i felt like disappearing into nothingness. I don’t even look weird nor have anything on me out the ordinary. I hate feeling like this. I hate going outdoors because i’m ALWAYS being watched in a almost ridiculing manner. Is it all in my head? I’ve had social anxiety for as long as i can remember. Sorry for venting to you on reddit. Just feeling really down."
ewslv32," Yeah, used to always wear a jacket or a wife beater under any shirt that I wore cuz I have puffy nipples so you can see it through my shirt. I absolutely despised myself because of this flaw to the point I lost a shit on ton of weight thinking it would get rid of it which it didnt. Anyways I got over it by literally walking outside shirtless, taking the subway shirtless. I was anxious the first time. I definitely got some judging looks but most people didn't give a fuck. Anyways, I saw that I could stand people looking down on me because of this flaw and not look down on myself, that most people did not give a fuck and some acceped me (or other aspets of me despite this flaw). More generally, I could see that that this particular aspect of me is ""inferior"" but myself which equals every single thing about me- each act, thought, emotion, physical feature, trait- is not inferior. Your underlying belief is that your flaws make you worthless and you hate yourself over these flaws. When you're outside you believe people are going to see your flaws and inevitably hate you because of them, and that'll just confirm the hypothesis that you have about yourself. To get over this you have to learn to see the difference between having deficiencies and being deficient, failing and being a failure, doing something stupid and being stupid. The latter are overgenerelizations and always imply that you're a total shit because an aspect of you is bad. In reallity, you're a person that does good, neutral, and bad things who has good, neutral and bad traits. REad these books: Feeling Good Handbook by DAvid Burns Feeling Good by David Burns "

qmqoyo,"Blushing/Erythrophobia is incurable, isn't it. My social anxiety stems from my blushing I'm mid 20s and I can't even walk down the street without blushing bright red. I have very very fair skin to make it extra noticeable, and I'm a guy also (less socially ok as it's a feminine trait). And it's psychosomatic because the fear of blushing in itself causes blushing. Even though I've tried exposing myself to society a lot over the past 6 months, it hasn't helped it whatsoever. When I get upset by it my muscles tighten and my eyes water along with it. I know it pulls a lot of attention. And there's no rationalizing it. In CBT they try to tell you (essentially) ""it's all in your head"". But in this expression it literally isn't, and I'm self aware enough to recognise that and as such spiral into sadness/suicidality. When I return home from being outside (even this is new to me) I often cry. As far as I know there are no pharmacological cures. Some suggestions about using topical ibuprofen, some about beta-blockers (I've tried these and they did nothing for inward or outward anxiety), suggestions of antidepressants which I have tried a dozen of and even things like pregabalin. Of course the operation but that costs many thousands and is irregularly performed. Benzos are the only drug that help the social anxiety so they are the most effective, but my health service refuses to prescribe these despite my having no history of drug abuse and being completely sober, even being recognised as disabled by the state by this very condition (SA), which has taken so much from me and left me no job, no friends, having never dated at 25 (so pathetic). If you're an outlier in a population from a health standpoint, socialised healthcare is useless. How can a person who is in possession of all his faculties and who is self aware enough to understand how dehumanizing a condition like this is, ever get over it? No matter that I'm coping with my depression - this problem will again and again bring me to my knees and reinforce all negative beliefs every time it occurs."

Where i work has no one my age working there, everyone is at least 5 years older and doesnt seem too interested in hanging out with a college kid. any tips or advice "
fj8yp3z," I dont know if I have insomnia but if I have something big planned for the next day, like the first day of class or a wedding for example, I just can not seem to go to sleep. My brain will not shut off. And then I start watching the clock and realizing if I dont get adequate sleep I wont preform at a high level the next day and this makes me even more stressed out. Its almost like I forget how to sleep and I am trying to force myself to go to sleep which is near impossible. I dont know how many times I've played in basketball games in which I have received no sleep the night before. This one time, I drove 5 hours with some of my buddies on a beach trip on no sleep. I stayed up all night unable to go to bed because I was just thinking about how the trip. It was very miserable to say the least. "
nlpq0n," I’d like your opinions please, do you guys think this event may have been a root cause in me developing SA?. I’ve been thinking about this lately but I can’t decide if it may be true or just dumb. But i’m 22 and plagued with SA and overthinking which is stopping me from doing things/taking risks, etc. I still vividly remember this memory back in either 4th or 5th grade where we were outside in the courtyard for dismissal (my school did that every day at dismissal, the whole school goes to the courtyard to wait for parents) and I was being dumb and kicking leftover water bottles from PE (idk why the hell I started doing that) next thing I know, the PE coach suddenly appears and yells at me LIKE CRAZY in front of the whole school to stop doing that, that kids may come back to pick them up, etc. Now I was already a shy kid so this shit was insanely embarrassing and I remember barely saying a word for the rest of the day at home. Could this have been what started or accelerated my social anxiety? I’m afraid and anxious of doing simple things like getting a job etc. as I am always afraid of messing something up and getting yelled at, being embarrassed, and all that good stuff. On the other hand I think it may not be because it was quite a long time ago, shouldn’t I have just gotten over that experience and put it behind me by now? idk this may be a dumb post but I’d like to hear opinions on what you guys think, thanks "
f6p96cs,"I don't really have much advice right now, but I just want to tell you that I've been where you are now, and I've gotten better. And you can too. When I was in university, I also lived by myself and got afraid of going outside. I stopped attending classes, and I didn't leave my apartment except for buying food and to bring the trash outside. Buying food, I always bought as much as I could carry and then ate it as slowly as possible in order to stretch it for as long as possible. Bringing the trash outside, a matter of seconds that often took me hours of mental preparation because I just couldn't manage to open the door and step outside. I don't know how feasible that is in your situation, but one part of how I got better was that I started running late at night/early in the morning when nobody was around. Like I forced myself to go jogging at some point between 2 and 6 a.m. every day. Not great for my sleep schedule obviously, but at least it took away my fear of the outdoors little by little, and the exercise helped a lot as well. If you don't feel like jogging, just taking a walk every night probably works just as well (though I feel like the physical exertion helped by distracting me from my fears). What also helped me was to stop thinking in terms of ""normal"". I was always disappointed with myself because I compared myself to other people or to what I considered a ""normal person"". Then I accepted that I have Social Anxiety, and I only looked at myself and my own improvement. Like before I would be like ""I can't even go to the supermarket without shaking and nearly freaking out, I'm such a loser"". After I would think more like ""Despite how difficult it is for me due to my social anxiety, I managed to go to the supermarket today. Great job!"" Basically, trying to change your negative thoughts into positive thoughts. Learn to support and compliment yourself. Learn to love yourself. Every small step matters."
en6jpov," I'm pretty much in the exact same boat as you man. I had it all growing up. I grew up in a wealthy family. My dad is a lawyer and my mom a speech pathologist. I have 3 wonderful sister and a few pets. I am/was extremely athletic and good at almost everything I did including school. I got straight A's all the way up until around high school. As I said already I grew up playing sports and had lots of friends. So much so, that you might even consider me to be popular back in the day. I was the kid in middle school and high school that you would always want on your team for any sport. I was really athletic and people even said I was decent looking. Fast forward 4 years later to senior year in college and everything has changed. I have a bunch of theories in my head that I think about all the time, in terms of ""what went wrong?"" Or ""how did I end up like this?"" By ""like this"" I mean depressed, lonely, and having a whole bunch of social anxiety. One of the reasons I think I may have turned out this way was because I was engulfed in playing basketball all the way through high school, that I never had time to focus on being social. I would spend more than half the day at my local gym working on getting better that I neglected being social and talking to girls. I got good as shit but damn did I feel like I missed out in high school. I would constantly avoid talking to people in school and when I did have a conversation and I would always try to plot my escape out of it. I had friends but the man reason for that can be attributed to me being good at basketball. Another reason i'm socially anxious might be what you said earlier about spending a lot of your time on technology. I can definitely agree with that. I think for me one of a major issue I have is comparing myself to people whether I conscientiously think about it or not. Everything on social media now a days is a competition. Particularly Instagram. I always find myself scrolling Instagram looking at couples my age on the beach or at a club smiling and having a good time. Meanwhile i'm in my room completely alone and feeling like my life sucks because i'm not as happy as them. And I think that crumbles my self -confidence and amplifies my self- hated. However, one way I can think of to counter this is to limit the amount of time you use on social media and understand that IT IS NOT A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. Some people were born with more advantages than you and with different skills. A lot of people don't have the anxiety you have and don't know for a second what its like. No one knows what you've been through except yourself. So, you have to try to be kind to yourself. Some days it can get really tough to remember this and you need to remind yourself of this daily. "
dk9z0ce,"I'm 25 and the same way, so you're not alone. I wasted most of my teenage years sitting in front of the computer every day after I came home from school. I honestly had no friends in high school. In college I got involved with a bad group of friends that just made me feel more untrusting of people and more anxious with interactions. I've never had a boyfriend, I'm still a virgin, and I watch as all my friends around me get married and have babies. I still only have about 1 or 2 friends I regularly hang out with now too. nnBut with traveling, know that you *can* go on cool trips even if you don't have people to go with, even if you're socially anxious. I used to think I could never travel alone because what if I got lost? What if I run into bad people? Could I handle organizing a trip by myself? And most of all, I'm a single woman, would it be safe for me to travel alone? But I finally began traveling alone starting with Iceland this year after saving up some money and you learn a ton about yourself. Even with my social anxiety, I was able to talk to a few people along the way! Which is huge, since I have such a hard time talking to people, much less making eye contact with them. While they may not be life long friends, it was nice grabbing dinner with them one night or hiking a waterfall together talking about where we're from. Honestly, I cared less what people thought of me while traveling alone because I'm probably never going to see them again anyway. So you can do it! Just force yourself to go and push your fears aside. It's never too late to start traveling."
g0wnoe0," Thanks, this did help calm me down. I was debating going on a bike ride and had anxiously decided against it to get some work done but now I think I will go for a ride. :) "
eyndycp," If you want a job that wont be too intimidating but will still improve your social skills then i recommend working at some type of activity venue. like a swimming pool, bowling, ice rink, escape room, etc. That may sound like a horrible idea, i definitely though so at first. But if you just work at like the front desk or shoe/skate hire, depending where it is your working, its a really great way to get used to serving customers without having an overwhelming amount of tasks to handle and not having to say too much. Example: I work at an ice rink in skate hire, theres only 3 things people can buy (rent) and the communication between me and the customer is very minimal. This was my first job and i was terrified but holyyy shit since ive started it my social anxiety has improved tremendously, and i can now confidently approach customers and make small talk, as well as with my coworkers. Lol sorry for the paragraph, but anyway this is just what worked for me so i wanted to suggest it as an option. 💗 "
4hkju5," Can I have some advice on how to be more outgoing and social for my last year of highschool?. The TLDR version of this question is basically the title, but here's some background about me: I'm 17 years old (M), and my junior year of highschool is about to end. I have very few friends, because I don't know how to meet new people and start conversations with others. For most of my life, until five months ago, I was a serious video game addict. I quit every sport I played by middle school and suffered a skateboarding accident that forced me to quit skating in middle school, along with the possibility of starting martial arts; something I craved to learn for years. I've never been particularly socially isolated, but as highschool has gone by, I've become more quiet, reserved, and distant from all of my friends, driving them away in fear of being too clingy to the couple that I have left. I'm above average intellectually, and I'm by no means good looking, but I'm not ugly either (I'm skinny and pale, but I'm 5'11, work out, and have nice hair / style). Maybe that's just my low self confidence speaking, because my ex-girlfriend mentioned to me that a couple of her friends thought I was cute, but then again, she was probably lying to me. I've conversely had girls tell me that I'm disgusting and that no girl would ever fuck me (that's a quote). Don't know which one to believe. Speaking of girls, I've had one girlfriend, and she had to approach me. That was four months ago, lasted a month, and I've only talked to one girl since (who flaked on me and made it very apparent she only wanted me to be her ""pen-pal"" even though my friend told me she had a crush on me). Even though in the past I've been known as a really funny guy, I feel pretty shitty about myself. Every time I see someone I want to talk to, I feel like it would be better off if I just said nothing to them because someone like me couldn't possible make their day better. When I walk next to people in the hall or outside school in the morning, I imagine what I would say to them, but just can't actually make the words come out because I'm fucking horrified of them thinking I'm weird and ugly and starting rumors about me that would just make me feel worse. And every single time I don't approach someone to strike up a conversation, that immediate feeling of regret sets in, yet I can never do anything to correct it; it's like my mind leaves my body and I just watch the opportunities go by like streetsigns, hardly able to be read in the darkness. I joined a movie club first semester in hopes of making new friends, but I ran into the same problem of being too awkward to really make anything happen, and then the club got shut down because the teacher sponsoring it got arrested and fired for fucking a student. Literally (he was hot though). I've heard rumors about me before; kids thought I was a ""satanist"" - whatever the hell that even means, I don't know. I've heard kids talking about me behind my back in class. Some kids just straight up make fun of me to my face. I don't know why I feel like this and I can't afford therapy (both of my parents are felons and I haven't heard from my father in over half a year), and I'm not going to use alcohol or drugs because that's fucked, and I've seen drugs ruin the lives of far too many people that were close to me. I need some serious help: I don't want to be lonely the rest of highschool; I've resorted to internet chat rooms but they just don't do it for me, and I constantly find myself talking to myself and sometimes imaginary people to ward off the feeling. I'm addicted to self help. I'm not going to call a suicide hotline because I know the guilt of putting my family through my loss will keep me from ever going through with it, but the thought dances in my head almost daily. Plus, I don't trust anyone, especially those who're paid to pretend like they care about you, including therapists (mom let me in on that one). I've heard all of the common advice: ""Just break out of your comfort zone and talk to someone!"" - that's the problem itself. ""Stop caring about what other people think about you!"" - easier said than done when you have to see the same people every single day. ""Just be yourself!"" - but I kind of hate myself? Sorry if this all sounded like bitching. But I'm desperate. I need real advice. Don't pull any punches, tell me what I need to hear and I'm open to expanding any information needed. I feel like I'm going crazy. I've been checking myself out of school just to avoid seeing people, and I've almost resorted to hiding in the bathrooms for periods at a time to not have to interact with others. I don't want to spread the shitty vibe, and that's why I can only open up to this stuff on reddit (if I talk to my mom about this, she just plays the victim and makes it about her and it just makes me feel worse). PLEASE. "
exic6r9,"Unbelievably accurate. I used to play baseball and I was good and it was probably one of very few things I was good at. Went in for varsity tryouts, and basically forgot how to play because of all of the coaches and other players watching. Didn’t make the team and 5 kids who were DEFINITELY worse than me made it. It KILLED my confidence for years. Still has an impact now."
euwrenk," Me all the time... with clubs, camps, etc "
fabn4ax," This is why I bike, EVERYWHERE. "
3xbywz," yes! i did it! i asked a friend to go to the beach. small wins.. update to a previous textpost i made yesterday. 20 y/o guy from australia and Peak Summer Weather at the moment and i want to enjoy it on the days i'm not working! so after aaages of freaking out i asked a friend if he wanted to go to the beach and he said yes (much to my glee/horror). a few more people said they were keen and i was just this weird mix of excitement and dread. unfortunately everyone ended up cancelling because it was too painfully hot to make it to the beach lol so it didn't go ahead but i'm glad i was able to ask people :) small wins, small wins! "
gy5k99," Were you Abused by your Parents?. I believe the root cause of my social anxiety was constant verbal abuse from my mother. She would scream at me constantly, call me ugly, disgusting, freak, worthless piece of shit, a failure, and tell me she 'hated' me and how she wished she ""never had kids"". She would call me a retard  and tell me I'd never be accepted at any college. She was embarrassed to go out with me in public in case she met other parents, since she ALWAYS compared me to other kids and was ashamed I did not get into an Ivy league school. She never let me go outside and I had a strict curfew. I wasn't bullied in school...the most anyone did was call me ""quiet."" I believe my family destroyed my confidence. Even today, I have no confidence in my abilities, I lack assertiveness, can barely make eye contact with others, and people constantly pity me or treat me like a child. It is embarrassing. No matter how many compliments I receive or how much encouragement others try to give me, it can't erase the years of abuse I endured during my formative years. "
fustqjv, So if we didn’t know each other but lived near each other and I messaged you just saying “hey you wanna hang out sometime” you would actively try to hang out with me? Even if I said it were to just go hiking or sitting in my living room watching tv? 
fscvv0e," I seriously need that Bernie Mac mentally lol. I don't really have much going on in my life aside from uni, I was in my first year up until the lock-down happened. Although I do tend to game a lot and make electronic music on my laptop. I try go for jogs every now and then. that's basically all I do nowadays. I've never had any kind of part-time work nor have I been in any kind of relationship. Also i don't drink....that's pretty much it "
ftaakw3," This is also my problem, when i go outside and see group of friends i just feel a deep anxiety whithin me. I just want to be in a group so bad but how can i if i get so anxious only by seeing them? "
ey48cqs,"I'm 23 and have been diagnosed with social anxiety, depression and OCD. I've recently started medication which has been helping a lot. I found speaking foreign languages has been a huge help. If I make a faux pas or make a fool of myself, the other person can chalk it up to me just not being fully fluent in the language yet. Or at least that's how I imagine it in my head. It's a bit nerve wracking at first, but after you have one or two conversations you can get in the swing of it. In addition to my two native languages, I speak 6 others at various levels. I also love solo travel, writing, reading, hiking, stationery (idk why, but it calms me) and music."
f78sopn, i do this too. i go stir crazy and get serious cabin fever. it basically happens everyday that im not in work. most of the time im staying home when im not in work to save money / reduce how much im spending but its also because there is nothing much to do around here. sometimes i go to the beach but mostly i just chill at home. i think just do whatever you want. if youre happy to be home all day do it or if you want to get out more just try it. 
d7lhty5,"Sorry but I may be a little bit too hard on you in my comment. I believe in you, you can improve and be better.

You probably won't feel better for a very long time. I had time where I reached my worst. My first and only panic attack happened 9 months ago, while I was working on my anxiety. I joined this subreddit because I felt so bad at the time. Reading the threads here made me realize that even though I felt so bad, I did improve a little because there was some stuff that I know I had issue with, that were no longer true. The improvements were small but they were real.nn&gt; My counselors seem to focus on boys and drama like that, thinking my issues are only composed of superficial shit like that.nnThen he isn't a good fit with you. You need to find someone else.nn&gt; I can barely stand to look at my reflection in the mirrornnYou hate yourself, don't you? That's feeding your anxiety. The first thing you will want to solve is that. Clearly you have people that desire you and want to have sex with you, you are clearly already way more good looking than most people here. Each time you hate yourself, remind yourself that you do worth it, that you do make effort about it and that you are just hard on yourself. One day you won't feel as bad and will be able to stand to look at your reflection. Believe me, we all went through this phase on this subreddit. It's not easy but you can do it.nn&gt; They don't want to go out with me or go hiking/climbing (things I like to do)nnFuck them, go alone or find others that do want to go. There's plenty of group that does, find some and go!

4ffgtb," Random Panic Attack. I had a weird experience this morning. I was happy for four hours and then I needed to get ready for work. Previously I had had some major social anxiety issues over this job, but since last week it has been okay. I've gotten used to it. I finished something I was doing for preparation and then I started feeling ill. My heart was beating heavily, I had chest pains, and I felt really jittery as if I had drunk too much coffee. It felt life-threatening and it scared me. I went upstairs to my mother (i'm 16) and she told me that I was having a panic attack. (I guess she has had a lot of those before) I wasn't worried about work or anything. It was just random. I guess it was a subconsciously triggered thing (really weird). We started talking about random shit just to keep my mind off the pain (because otherwise it would have gotten worse from me worrying about it). By the time it started fading (after 25 minutes) it was time for me to go, so I got my bike prepared (still feeling uneasy) and then as soon as I got on my bike the pain went away. I don't understand this craziness. I have never had a panic attack before. I wasn't feeling any dread, which makes me wonder why it happened now and not a few weeks ago when I was seriously freaking out over my job. This isn't really directly related to social anxiety, but I feel like it was worth sharing anyway. (too many parentheses, IDK why I did that. I never do that) "
fhawes,"Social anxiety just keeps ruining my life. I just finished crying, crying over what happened Tuesday. I was in class and OFSTED was coming my school. On Monday, we (the 6th formers) were told to wear our ID badges but I broke my lanyard pretty early on. We were told to go up to the head of 6th form if we’re missing anything. I decided not to since they don’t care most of the time and I was too anxious to get one and even if I did, I would feel too self conscious to wear it. Tuesday came and didn’t wear my ID which annoyed the teacher that came late to the lesson (she’s always late). She told me to go up to the head of 6th form to get the lanyard but I didn’t since I was too anxious to go. To started to get more annoyed as OFSTED was in school and they want to look for them (like every time they come). Someone offered to go up to get it for me but the teacher said and said “She’s mature enough to do it herself” I’m there like, I HAVE SOCIAL ANXIETY. I’ve told the class that I have social anxiety, very awkwardly tho. But she continued to insist that I go up on my own to get it. But I physically and mentally couldn’t. I had a feeling that if I left the room, I would have a mental breakdown and then I started to cry. She made a comment about how I’m doing whatever I want and that she couldn’t deal with it anyone (this isn’t the first I had a mental breakdown in class. First time was when she suddenly told us that we had to do presentation in front of the class) I stopped crying after to told me to sit up and I tried to not cry again until I got home. I just feel so tired of constantly being unable to do the basic things. I can’t even walk outside without feeling anxious at least once. The smallest moment can lead to so much anxiety. I wish I can just stop feeling so anxious but it’s so hard to stop. Even after 4/5 weeks of CBT, I’m still feeling the same as from the beginning, if not worse. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I wish I can just drop out and get away from the source of so much of my anxiety but I can’t since my parents forces me to go. Sorry about this lengthy post, I just don’t have anyone to vent to"
eeelqhd," sometimes its the corniest lines that hold the deepest truths. I agree, being honest is a great thing to do, and can even be a catalyst for change in your life. Honesty and acceptance of and with yourself can bring about a whole new confidence that can change your SA situation. Keep rowing against tides man, you'll eventually reach the ""endgame"". "
fct5uq8," That's okay. I was the same way most of my life until I started college. I hid in the bathroom during lunch at school and said literally nothing to anyone. I still go through phases where I'm convinced everyone thinks I'm a depressed loser and I'll never be able to connect with anyone. Focus on your own happiness. Go for runs every day or go to the gym. You might hate it at first but over time it'll help your self esteem tremendously. And the best way to find friends is through hobbies. Find a hobby you enjoy and find people who also enjoy it. For me it was guitar. I still rarely am able to truly be comfortable around people, but I've grown to accept that because it's part of who I am "
dih4xbh," I like rock music, rock climbing, bmxing and im trying to learn guitar. I dont watch much tv but i like zombie films and documentries. "
ecgg54u,I love how you suddenly notice the actual beautiful things like trees and building around you when there's no anxiety. Brings into light how much anxiety affects our daily lives.
oov5tc,"why am I so intimidated by males, when I'm a Male myself?. Hi. 13 year old Male here. this morning when my mom and me got in the car to pick up my little brother from summer camp, the neighbor guy happened to be in his driveway going to his car. when I looked out the passenger window as I was putting my seat belt on, He was walking my way a little to say hi to my mom. When I saw him I jumped. Im embarrised now and am afraid that he saw me jump like a scaredy cat. Why am I so nervous around other Males? It's not like I'm gay and attracted to them."
s6fbdh, waving at people is bad. waved at a random lady whilst out walking and she scoffed at me. why. i was just being polite. i thought that was a good thing. i was in a decent mood for once. wanted to share it. lol. fuck leaving the house. (please forgive the passive-aggressiveness this post is drenched in. just frustrated and had to share it.) 
f6tr0ll," Ive never had any account on social media like facebook. I've never been particularly interested in this. As a teenager I cared about games most of the time. I was socializing only when it included some kind of play, like soccer, hide and seek etc. I was a loner who liked to play on his computer most of the time. "
dt55e1g, We should change ours to SAnD. Now figure out what sand has to do with social anxiety. 
d8tcydg," I feel I'm in the same situation as your friend. I think all of this comes from a low self esteem. I don't place value in myself, I expect others to do it, I want validation from others but I don't validate myself. In therapy we talked a lot about my SA, and the conclusion is that I have a lot of anticipatory anxiety, before the event. I skipped going to horse riding because I thought ""everyone hate me"" ""I'm weird"" and so on. It's the anxiety before the event that stops me. And also because I'm not really interested in that activity as I said in my post. "
g178i5d, Yeah but you're lucky to be able to still go outside and have a life. He's in a really bad place 
ifxm8a," Achievements and a thing that stressed me out. *Hey, I use this profile to document all of my achievements with SA, sometimes they may seem super small but I find it worth noting* Today, I started online class, my first one went well and I kept my camera on the entire time, I was only a little bit nervous. Second one, It got a bit tough, there were some technical difficulties and I joined a Zoom meeting but the teacher wasn’t there because she started another meeting on Google Meet. There were people there on Zoom and they started talking. Here, I started to feel anxious, and I think someone asked a question and I replied. Then, I saw two girl in one screen (I think they had a class together and were friends) and they started laughing. Their mic was muted so I couldn’t necessarily assume that they were laughing AT me and they were looking at something on their phone but I still felt super awkward. I decided to ask the group a question, and I saw their faces they looked confused I think I was but they answered me. Then I saw the two girls laughing again... idk but I hope it’s a coincidence but I felt like I was in high school again. Third class, it got easy again! I was able to interact by chat with people and I got in discord to talk with people Later, I decided to call customer service for Amazon, and I spoke on the phone!! And I was stressed and maybe sounded stress on the call but then I realized that ppl who work for call centres, deal with a lot of angry people so they wouldn’t care if there was someone nervous talking to them. And I’m planning to take my dog on a walk later while it’s still light outside!! "
f3259w3," Don’t worry, is just a fucking license, I don’t have it either and I don’t even care, I do all my stuff by walking haha, really...ask her out and if she offer u a ride...great, not a problem, or just take a uber, really man, you are not a loser for not having a license do drive a metal box "
kq8evg," 19M bit of an unusual post. Hi, Im stepping out of my social anxieties boundries, take my hand, can you come with me? Im looking to meet someone, on here, who, like me, has social anxiety. Maybe we can help each other and be friends? Im single too, so if youre a girl that'd be cool: My name is Matt, Im 19 and from Wales, UK. Im looking for a girl who I can love, care for and hopefully have lovely experiences with. Im looking for someone who knows what life is like, and wont abandon me on days where Im down, but comfort me, and let me comfort them on their down days too. I feel relationships are two way and equal. Thats equal good, and equal bad. One day we can meet, hopefully have the same chemistry as on here, and we can build a life, have lovely holidays and complain about the weather. I just guess I want something of a special connection, love and chemistry with someone. Trust me, if you give it your all, I will do the same. I think if both people are happy and willing things will work out. I know you're human and you know I am. But together we can bring out the best in one another and thats what I love about relationships and its what Im looking forward to having one day. If we have goals I hope we can help one another reach those goals. I want to help you and Id hope you'd help me too. About me, Im 6'1 and weigh 64kg and yes Im underweight. Im an indie, alt rock musician. I play guitar, write songs and sing. I love gaming too, I play all sorts, loving Dont Be Afraid and Watch Dogs Leigon right now though. I also have Siege, Mincecraft, few other games. Incase you havent figured it out, Im on PC. I also love to drive, its nice and calming. I enjoy cycling and walking as a form of exercise. Me --------&gt; [ibb.co/pw7mvZt](My favourite band is Blue October, I have one of their logos tattooed on my arm -------&gt; [I also love Linkin park, Fort Minor, Chris Cornell, Soundgarden, Audioslave, Temple of the Dog and Pearl Jam. I know how to play most of Blue October's songs on my guitar, I know a few Linkin Park songs and quite a few from Chris and his bands. As for what Id like you to be? I dont really have specifications, you arent a car or a guitar. You can be big, small, whatever. As long as you're kind to me, understanding, caring and sweet I really dont give a damn. As I said, I hope we bring out the best in each other whilst accepting and working on any negatives. However, that being said, I am human, so I do have preferances, just things I like, its superficial because I really only care for personality. But heres stuff for bonus points I guess?? Theres a few I like, so dont just click off cos your not point 1! And anyway, this is all superficial, so message me anyway please! I just really like girly girls and valley girls. I dont know why but it has always attracted me. Ive always thought my attraction was weird, but now I think, whats to lose? I either get exactly what Im looking for or excactly what Im looking for + extra points, surely worth a try right? I dont know why but Ive always found these types of girls most attractive to me, girls who love dresses and skirts, makeup, nails and heels. It just makes me happy seeing a girl that takes passion in these things. I love it when girls talk about their fashion, I dont get it, but it makes her happy, so it makes me happy. I just suffer with conditions (depression, anxiety, schizophrenia) and I suppose having someone all cutesy, bubbly and uplifting will make all the difference in my life. So message me and tell me about your latest lip gloss or how you styled your hair, most guys hate it but I love it, it attratcts me. Theres no point me wondering why it does, I should just accept it and find a girl who makes me happy and I hope to make her happy to. On the other side of the spectrum I really like emo/goth/scene girls. Its cute, evil and fun. I love the crazy hair and piercings. And plus their humour is more on parr with my humour style too. I like the big boots, crazy clothes and obviously the music. Why dont we make Monster guns together whilst rocking out to crazy loud music? Maybe we could duet together??? Just sayin' And I suppose in the nutural middle I love tomboys andcountry girls. Show me your horses. Can I please poke them? Do you have access to a sheep i can poke? I just wanna poke a sheep but all the wild ones dont want it, and those in captivity judge you like crazy for poking them. Or maybe we can sit in trees? Ill bring my acoustic guitar and sing sweet melancholy whilst you sit in the tree gazing at the sky. Please feel free to message me if this sounds like what you're looking for or something you'd enjoy one day! Thank you, I cant wait to read your message! "
4z6pfi," Guys I'm Taking a Huge Leap, and I'm Terrified.. So I always read that one of the best ways to overcome a fear is by exposure therapy and I was trying to think of an opportunity to force myself to not only be around people, but to interact with them too. Working in IT is not doing me any favors in the SA department. I always had that lucrative dream of just moving to a mountain town and working on a mountain and snowboarding all Winter. It's one of my biggest passions and there is nothing more relaxing in my mind. Except I knew that my SA would keep me from packing up everything I own and move away from my comfortable situation in the Midwest. Even with all of that in mind I decided to give it one last shot this season even though I knew I would probably back down. (I'm 24 with no wife/Kids/mortgage. Now is definitely the time) When I looked at this as a big task it was terrifying, then I started to break it down into small individual task. (1. Get a job up there. 2. Get housing 3. Sell uneeded stuff etc.) and I realized that this was totally doable. Just focusing on the job wasn't too hard. Submitted a few resumes and before I knew it I had a job. HUGE pay cut, but it is a job that will force me to not only interact with individuals, but also fit them for skis/snowboards. Not only do I have to talk to them, but I have to touch their feet. Then with that set in stone I needed to find housing. With a dog, housing in a mountain town is a nightmare but I finally found a guy who is cool with my dog, has a fair price, and would do a seasonal lease. Nice! Two biggest hurdles down. The rest of them are fairly easy (Other than an affordable way to move my stuff up there w/o owning a truck...). But it's a good (or bad?) thing I already signed my lease because I just saw a picture on my company's facebook of an employee fitting boots for a little kid and It really [startled](me. I know this will be good for me but all the sudden I find myself listing out different conversation topics to have with 5 year olds XD. I'm so damn nervous but if there is anything that you guys can take away from this, its to break up the nerve wracking tasks of a social situation into little chunks and remember that simply showing up to a situation that makes you uncomfortable should be viewed at as a victory. TL;DR: Working job in IT that tailors to my SA. Quitting and moving across country to work on a mountain at a job that will really push my SA limits. "
ryrzwd," My Spiderman Story. So I was at the movies watching Spiderman: No Way Home for the second time with my Brother and his Girlfriend, because third wheeling is just something you do when you have crippling anxiety. Well anyways, I popped some edibles right before it began and it seemed everything was going good. I had a great theater experience the first time I watched it and I was looking forward to seeing Green Goblin whoop some ass again, only this time in IMAX. Well right as its about to begin these two guys walk in and sit one seat away from me. They began whispering to each other and making jokes almost immediately. It didn't bother me that bad at first, because I figured they'd stop eventually. But nope! As the movie went on not only did they talk more and more, but they were getting progressively louder. I'm pretty sure it's cause they were high as well, I saw them hitting their pens now and then( I never saw them exhale the smoke though lol) But anyways at this point even my brother from two seats away has noticed and he tells me to tell them to quiet down. Well shit, at this point I knew I had to say something, but I was getting so damn anxious. I sat there for a while thinking of how to say it, at what level of volume, with what tone, and alternate scenarios where they just ignored me or got angered. I was like Doctor Strange sifting through every single possibility where this shit goes south. Anyways knew I had to say something ya know, cause the poor girl sitting directly next to them wasn't saying shit. So finally as my heart rate is fucking jumping, my thoughts are going rapid fire and my anxiety is at the fucking peak of the mountain. I reach over and say ""Can you guys keep it down"", in a very serious voice. The guy looks over at me and kinda just goes "" yeah"". And for the rest of the movie they do just that. Yeah, that stupid little confrontation took a shit ton out of me, and the funniest thing was I felt so proud after lmao. My heart was literally racing after. If I'm being honest I think I startled them more than I was because they were so high they must have had no idea they were being so loud. Anyways needless to say that was a terrible movie experience cause somebody left the door to the entrance open and you could hear the line of people outside waiting to buy snacks. Also halfway through some little kids walked in and started yelling in their high pitched voices ""OMG MOM ITS SPIDERMAN CAN WE WATCH IT????? I WANT TO WATCH IT!!!!"" The icing on the cake was some dudes saying "" SHEEEEESH"" Whenever something major happened or a character appeared. God I love the movies. "
ls9oyr," It's hard. It's sunny here where i live. I decided to go out and... god i wish i had stayed home. Seeing guys and girls around my age having fun while i was there sitting on a bench all alone... without the abilty to talk with anyone... without friends... without self esteem and with a shitty life. I almost had a panic attack and i had to go back home. I know there is a solution for our agony, like my grandma said: the only problem without solution is death itself. But man... i can't really see the light at the end of the tunnel :( "
aiqlhu," First day of community college. Like most people, I had my first day of college ever. The last time I was in an official school was May of 2015, when I graduated high school. So, it’s been awhile. I was trying to find my classes and I wasn’t nervous. The first class was cancelled. I went to my second class and as soon as I entered the room, the teacher said she’s cancelling the class. So, I sat down in this commons area until 10:40am for my next class at 11am. There was only a few people who were there, so, it wasn’t bad. I get in the next class at 10:40am. Only 3 people are in the room. But, slowly, more people started entering the room. I was getting a little more nervous. Twenty minutes later, the last student came in and the teacher was right behind them. She introduced herself then said the dreaded “Tell me about yourself” and told us to ask her a question for her to answer. My mind was racing trying to find something to say. When it was my turn, I said “I know how to ride a RipStik, which is like a two-wheeled skateboard.” As soon as I said that, I heard someone, behind me, mock me. I wish I could have said something in that moment but the teacher was still talking as the person mocked me. I didn’t even get to ask her a question. By the end of class, I was thinking I should say something to him, but, then I hesitated because I didn’t know if it was that person or a different person, so, I just let it go. I just stared at the guy, who, *I thought*, mocked me for about 3 seconds while simultaneously putting on my stuff. Then, I drove home. "
bsodjb," What the fuck is life about? Happiness? I have no personality. Tired of fucking people pleasing and being their fucking servent.. Im lost on what to do. Is life about self improvement? I dont know how to make friends or how to talk to people mostly girls, i see people as gods mostly girls. Im tired of chasing their approval/attention and them not giving a f about me or not even caring about me, they talk to me cause they feel sorry for me. Makes me feel invisible.. tired of people pleasing and ass kissing just to be my friends, I ask them questions like im their fucking servent Im literally worthless.. I dont have a personality im boring as hell and bland. No charisma i aint fun either, i dont have opinions or thoughts on anything...im just a boring bland r/niceguys, i aint cool.. im generic af. I dont have banter with anyone and i aint funny. i feel stupid af and feel like i can never be smart. Im passive or aggressive.. I dont even know how to do small talks, i dont know what to say to new people i meet. My convos are always like interviews with everyone.. all i talk about is nonsense no wonder no girl ever likes me. And i have always been the one putting all effort in or asking questions first. Then i run out of ""boring questions to ask"" Always me doing the chasing. I dont know how to ask intesresting questions or be interested in other person. I dont have a smart brain like you guys. For me life is all about textin girls and porn or at least was. I have stopped watching porn for 4 days and stopped talking to girls. Its like i want a GF so bad to make me feel better so i chase it.. maybe i need self love first. But idk what it means. In my life im important to no one no one loves me and i compare my self to guys with GFs or friends or their money. Now im overwhelmed by advices and i have so many problems i just want to end my fucking life. I dont know how to fix them. My anger is raising up at my self for not doing shit. I just want to smash my phone into pieces. I feel like if i be positive i will be lying to my self.. like saying ""im smart"" but im really not.. then it becomes high ego. Why is it so hard for me to make friends.. idk... or make girl-friend online? Its so effortless for someguys. What do i have to do to make people like me? What do i have to do to make friends? What do i have to do to have a personality and not be boring/bland/worthless and stop chasing peoples approval or people pleasing? I want to be a footballer in future but isis was in my country this country aint for dreams for anybody..i live in a small town no therapy or much hobbies to do. I go outside there is no fuckin thing to do... Im tired of complaining. "
j4j08p,"How i battled my social anxiety.. So i am 16 yo and i had social anxiety for at least 4-5 years now (that I'm aware of). Now it isn't so bad as some of you guys who've posts I've read where it was so bad to the point where it interfiered with your life dramatically, but nonetheless it was there. First i started feeling very nervous talking to other people (especially girls), in fact, i would avoid them, not interacting with them at all. When my friends started flirting with them, i would be like ""yeah, that's stupid"" or ""who needs a girlfriend anyways"". I was basically making excuses for myself, and when i did talk to them i wold start thinking of all the possible ways of how i could embarrasse myself. My heart would start pounding, palms sweating, and more often than not my voice would crackle. At one point i really got pissed of, i was angry at my self for having these thoughts, so whenever i would catch myself having them i would try to fight them, for example: when i would talk to someone, and started thinking how i could embarrasse myself i would embarrase myself on purpose. I started acting really weird... and it was all to contradict my anxious thoughts. It was like when you have a grandparent who is owerly cautious, always telling you be carefully with this and that, and then you do something stupid just to provoke them. It was like that, but instead of real person i was provoking my anxiety. And yes i know it sounds wierd. But even at that point I wasn't fully aware of my anxiety. I wasn't fully and consciously aware of it trying to solve it. Worst time was definitely when i was 15. At that period my anxiety peaked. I didn't go outside much, if at all. The only thing i would do all day is that i would lay on my bed and watch youtube all day. I became so anxious i would worry to go to supermarket, just the thought of having to interact with cashier was stress inducting, not to mention that i would have to greet my neighbors, oh boy. It was really hard year. Then highschool started which worsened my already miserable life. I really was used to my middle school friends, and process of meeting new people was really stressful. At that point i snapped, i had enough, i really got sick of being this way. i knew something had to change. Then the eal battle began about 9 month ago. I really focused on fixing this problem. Meditation and little bit of weed here and there really gave me perspective into myself. I started ""catching"" my anxious thoughts, and started fixing it at the root. I forced myself to go out more, to talk and meet more people, and really to just be more social. All in all, i had quite a few successes, some minor, some major. Important thing to me is that my anxiety is improving. It's not a full-on win, but it's definitely getting better."
clh0t6," What do i do for self improvement? How to like/work on my self? Im in rock bottom. Im lazy af.. Whats my biggest problem? Do i need to work on my self? Will i at least fix some things? I have been posting for over a year now i dont want it to be 2 years. What should be my first step? What did you guys do? What should i do? I have no personality or self love or communication skills or friends. I have nothing to offer to anyone. I never have long convos. I want to beat my self up so badly. But i know if i want somethin i have to do it myself. But im in a lot of pain and confused with many problems i have. Idk where to start. No one loves me. Whats do i do to make people like me/give me attention? I have no friends and im bad with girls online. im a boring person/conversialist/im passive aggreasive/i have a boring life/no selfesteem/i aint wise/im too generic/no confidence/im uncreative/im needy and desperate/im dull and bland/not cool/no knowledge/no skills/no qualities/no job/no sense of humour/i have no creativity or imagination/i have no ideas or orginal opinions or jokes/not funny/not likeable/not friendly/not charismatic/i dont have a sharp minded or good thinking one/not witty/ not charming/not fun/not intelligent or smart/im not mysterious im very predictable/im not a genius/ im rude sometimes arrogant and ignorant im egotistical.. i make boring dull uncreative rude and egotistical jokes. How am i supposed to fix all these? Is it possible?? How do i do self improvment? I always try hard to be liked by people or impress people, so i will feel worthy or valued or they give me attention. Its like i want people to give me happiness, make me feel smart. Or i please people just to be friends. I think truly in my heart i dont like anyone esle too. Or interested in anyone. I have no plans or goals or big dreams. No one loves me. Im like an bactaria to this world. Im in bottom for everything. Only good thing about me is i know 2 langauges. Im not special. Just an invisible foolish idiot with no life. I have such a small mind. How do i break this cycle of passive aggressiveness? To be happy? And my hobbies are soccer/movies/tv shows thats it. Perhaps i get more hobbies? Or be interested in somethin? I have no passions at all. I dont read books or learn somethin everyday. Im just a brick or a stone. I feel empty. Stupid. Moronic. Probably the most stupid man in earth. No one misses me ever. I have stopped masturbatin now my mind is telling me to do it again or ""Get a GF/lover"" to fill the hole in your heart. I run out of things to say or ask, or i ask boring questions no one seems to care about, or i ask questions like interviews, sometimes i have nothing to say, standing in groups like a child and everyone seems to be so experienced. Idk how to open up conversations, my convos last about 3 mins about any subject..i run out of material, idek how to do small talks. Idk how to make friends, or how to get closer to people. Or im the one who always says more. My chats are always one sided, no one is interested in me or what i say. Rn i just want someone around me anyone. I used to be with people who would bully me. Im like peoples servents. Its why i have entirely lost my interest in everything, even getting to know people or trying to make friends.. bc idk any of it. I ask boring questions the person replies with a long answer or short answer. idk how to continue the conversation after it. Maybe bc i have no experience in anything I never get any attention..i always chase others its not other way around. I please people just to be friends with me. I have no personality or qualities. Im the worst version of my self. I have nothing to offer/give to people. Im nothing. I dont blame people for not liking me. I feel invisible. I try so hard to get my happiness from others.. i want friends also. Ik i need to get internal validation but how?? My thinkin is if i get a GF i can be finally happy and use it to fill the hole inside my heart. Ik that wont still fix it. What will??? I put everyone on the pedestal mostly girls. I see everyone on tv or movies as they are everything am not. I keep comparing my self to them. Its always people likin or disliking me. I never dislike anyone. Coz idk how to know people. Maybe texting online shouldnt be the place for makin friends for me. But people end up ignoring me bc i bore the fuck outta of them and i hate my self bc of. Nobody likes me like me, no one loves me or thinks im important.. i dont connect with anyone. Guess no one is a big loser as i am. Im just one of those brainless boring dull bland r/niceguys. Not liked by a single person. I dont blame ppl for not likin me. I never had a BF or GF i dont think i ever will.. i depend on porn and textin girls to feel ""valued/worthy/get attention"" i always depend on external for validation, idk how to find internal validation. Am i this bad or porn is makin me worse? Even when i make people laugh its all because i get lucky and i remember something from somwhere. I have no ideas no opinions no knowledge to arguement no thoughts no sharp thinking. Im just a body. I have no soul no brain no intelligence. I even run out of subjects to bring up. I get jealous/hate my self bc guys who are lady killers and girls just drop their pants for them. While i just get ignored by ""Girls online"" i cant even be friends with them. Idek how to flirt with girls. I always ask boring questions i run out of questions to ask. I talk about or say boring stuff that no one seems to care about.. i just always feel super foolish or dumb or untelligent.. i always just sit home and do nothing. Im lazy af. I just feel like im not good enough. I feel like people are too cool for me. I feel like everyone is cooler/smarter/funnier than me. Everyone has friends or a girl loves them but i dont have anyone.. i have become girls ""text buddiez"" its always one sided chats. Its like i have to entertain them otherwise they leave.. its like this with everyone its like a test.. i have been so worried about people liking me, i have forgot my life. Like whats my purpose? Whats life ? Who am i ? Idk whats my goal. I have no fucking idea what to do with my life or my self.. is the answer to all these self improvment? How do i have a personlity? "
6y4xjy," Social Anxiety: I sometimes have a problem with being myself around strangers and especially have a problem being myself around family. Anybody else have this issue?. Long story short, I'm super self-conscious of the way I talk to people when I first meet them and around certain family members. I'm 24 years old for a point of reference. If you want to read my lengthy self-analyzation, go ahead: When I'm around people, or certain family members, I don't want to sound too stupid, or too smart, or too outgoing, or too shy, or too much of anything! This causes me to lose my train of thought and sometimes even slur my words because I get so nervous about what the other person thinks of me. Sometimes in this situation, when I don't know how to act, I tend to adopt some of the mannerisms and qualities of the other person in order to get them to like me. But in the end, that never works out. I'm aware that it's best to be myself. When I'm around people I am comfortable with, I am kind of silly, outspoken, I enjoy cursing, and I'm super empathetic of others. I have a bit of passion when I'm talking and sometimes I do not use correct grammar or I don't enunciate enough which makes me worry that I do not sound intelligent. I'm not entirely lady-like, but consider myself feminine in many ways. I fear that some of these qualities don't make me attractive. For whatever reason. But part of me thinks the anxiety stems from my family. My mom behaves kind of like me, and she loves me and accepts me for who I am. She pushes me to just be myself all the time (which can be hard). My dad (who is re-married and lives in a few states away from me), doesn't see me as his ideal daughter. I'm kind of a messy person sometimes when it comes to keeping a car or an apartment clean. I don't do a very good job, but my dad tells me that no man will ever like me because I'm somewhat messy. He always says that no man will ever like me because I curse sometimes. My dad's new wife spreads her ass cheeks for Jesus Christ. Figuratively speaking :). I'm not against religion, and I'm not very religious at this point in my life, but my dad and step-mom take Catholicism to the next level. They are devout Catholics that attend church several times a week. They criticize me for not attending and for not having faith. My dad seems to think that this makes me unattractive and unable to get married if I don't believe in God. I disagree with this. I sometimes pray to an arbitrary force, as a way of reflecting on my hopes and desires and kind of like ""sending a message to the universe"". I believe in helping others and helping yourself equally. I believe in meditation, and nature, and being open-minded, and acknowledging/respecting other people even if they are odd, strange, etc. I believe in a lot of things, but not things that I cannot prove concretely such as a bearded man in the sky or burning in hell. Thats not to say it isn't true, but I don't want to live my life entertaining those possibilities which (to me) don't seem feasible. Does this make me unattractive? My step-mom is probably borderline OCD with the amount of time and the ferocity she exudes when cleaning. Good for her. I mean birds crash into the shiny windows a lot so that must mean you're good at cleaning. I'm not really like that. I don't live in filth, but my clothes often find a new home on the floor for a few days. My dad doesn't seem to think that I'll find someone who likes me for being messy. But hey, I don't have time to be clean. My step-mom is very dainty and flower-likes and skinny and feminine . She often wears dresses and is super self-conscious of her appearance and strives to adhere to perhaps an old-school societal standard of women. My dad seems to think that this is a way a lady should behave and think about herself. I sometimes wear dresses and I love pretty, feminine clothing. However, I enjoy my very very slight chubbiness and having 1.5 chins and a thick butt and wearing a t-shirt and ripped jeans a lot. I like laid back clothing for myself right now because I gained a little bit of weight. I don't care if my hair isn't done, or if my socks match, or if I'm wearing make-up or not, but this is depending on the situation of course. Sometimes I don't even wear a fucking bra because I just don't fucking care. Also, I'm sometimes a work-a-holic. I need to feel like I have a sense of monetary control, and I like the idea of making a lot of money or the same amount of money as a potential partner. I do not like the idea of not working at all or spending another person's money. It makes me feel inferior. Does this scare off men? I mean like fuck, if I were to rely on someone's income, it'll fuck me over if a divorce happens! Another thing is that I enjoy drinking! My dad says this is a turn-off to men. And no, my step-mom barely touches alcohol. I, however, will not turn down a shot and can finish a glass of wine pretty quickly. My parents are all fresh off the boat from Poland and Germany so I can't help that drinking runs in my blood. During family events my dad will cut me off and give me judgey eyes, and it really pisses me off. I feel like an underage child being scolded, and I'm fucking 24. Obviously as an adult, I can drink to my hearts content, but the principle irritates me. He's unaware that I know when I've reached my drinking limit. I know when to stop drinking before I drive. I know how many drinks a week is standard to drink so I don't fuck up my liver for life. I've had my fair share of drunken experiences and as a bartender, I know a lot about alcohol. I deal with drunks daily! I'm not naiive, and I regulate my alcohol intake without restricting myself completely. Is it that bad that I still drink? I mean C'mon. Also my family thinks I'm joking when I tell them, but I am a Bi-Sexual. I see myself with a male in a long-term romantic role, but I have enjoyed being with women sexually. I'm okay with this. I enjoy being sexually fluid, but I fear that it scares off other people. Anyway TL;DR - perhaps I'm not a super lady-like girl, and have different opinions and outlooks on life. I'm worried that it makes me unlikable considering that I do struggle with making new friends and have yet to come across a successful romantic partnership. With this being said, anyone else feel like this? Do you feel nervous when interacting with new people to the point where you don't even know how to act? How do you cope with rejection? Or the thought of rejection? Or the thought of being alone for a long time or forever? "
7hl6fs," I'm so tired of not being able to properly have little interactions with people. My dogs broke out of the house and I had to chase them all around the neighborhood again. This happens every so often and nobody ever offers to help me catch them. I was able to catch the bigger one and the other is very obedient when she isn't being instigated by her sister. So I was walking home with her in my arms and the other in tow when some guy on his bike asked me if I needed any help. I told him I could handle it and he was like ""oh that's such a beautiful dog"" and told me about how he had a pit that he had to put down a few years ago. All I can ever think of are the basics like ""Yeah"" and ""Oh really?"" Like he was such a nice guy and the only person to ever offer me help and I felt like such a pathetic weirdo. My mother pulled up in the car and he helped me get the dogs in so I shook his hand and thanked him and that was it. Also as I was chasing them they went into my neighbors yard and he came walking out of his garage so I just looked at him for a second and didn't say anything. That's my freaking neighbor I shouldn't be afraid to say hi or whatever. Of course he didn't say anything to me because he's been observing my odd behavior for years and probably thinks I'm creepy. I'm so pathetic. If it weren't for my niece I would kill myself. "
dfrtkq0," &gt;So basically it's their playground to get approval that all these guys are talking to them, and they don't give a shot about your emotions. There is always a guy better looking, nicer, and more social just a swipe away they can use. This is what has been getting to me lately. All these women with huge inflated egos turning people down left and right, acting like they're better than everyone else and making fun of you while they turn you down. I can barely handle simple rejection, there's no need to kick a man while he's down and tell him he's ugly or some shit. I get that I'm socially stunted and incredibly ugly, no need to pour it on. They either think they're better than you and make fun of you or they think you have the plague and avoid you. There's no winning. I'm done with trying to meet a ""significant other"". I'm fed up with all of it. "
njr3pd,"Seating arrangements at meals give me major anxiety. I hate going to dinner with big groups. Like seriously I despise it. Mainly because the seating arrangement can make the whole experience incredibly awkward. The other day I went for a hike with some acquaintances. There were lots of people I didn’t know. We got sushi after and I ended up sitting right across from some dude who I just had nothing in common with and we were kind of forced to try to make conversation. I was so tired from the hike and I just had nothing in common with this person. I really felt like I was just waiting for the meal to end and I felt so awkward. Similarly I remember being seated across from my aunt (who I do not know well at all) a few years ago at a fancy dinner. I was 18. We just had nothing to say to each other. It was awkward. Honestly I find meals in general to give me anxiety unless I’m extremely comfortable with the person. I feel so much pressure to keep the conversation going and I dread awkward silences. Eating in general can be sort of awkward. Gah, do some people realize just not feel anxious about any of this stuff?"
dk3gj8s," Yes it's possible without drugs and psychologist. The problem is, is that there are so many damaging misconceptions about social anxiety how to relieve yourself from it. Most people think you have to remove negative thoughts from your head and fill your head with positive thoughts but this is an exhausting and fruitless exercise. Instead we must accommodate our negative thoughts and feelings, listen to what they have to say and decide whether they are useful to us or not. You talk about sweating profusely and nerves building to excessive levels, anxiousness hitting your stomach like a pound of ham. It's great that you seem so in touch with the way that you feel, that you can describe it with such colour. Out of the places mentioned, where do you want to visit the most, restaurant, beach, coffee shop, or somewhere else? What is it about the place that brings you pleasure? for example: the feel of the sand between your toes on the beach or the roasted smell of the coffee in your cup at the coffee shop? Have a think about it and make it your primary focus when you visit them. You will probably still feel like you're being stabbed in the gut with an anxiety knife but don't let it stop you from experiencing the real sensations going on around you (focus on the touch, smells, tastes, sounds, sights). This will help you to prove to your brain that it doesn't need to protect you as fiercely as it already does. Eventually your negative feelings will start to feel a bit redundant because you're not really letting them guide your actions anymore. With this, they will get naturally less severe and a little quieter and you will feel like you've awoken from a horrible nightmare and feel relieved. I recommend the 'Candice Esposito', 'Calm living blueprint' podcasts as they've really helped me find freedom from my anxiety. You can find them online and you don't need to pay. "
7iwhkt," Conversations and learning to know other people. I don't think I've ever had proper conversations until last year or so. Not in my whole life, and I'm 25 now. Today it seems easier to distance myself from this realization enough to post about it. I've started to see how this lack of socialization that started at a young age (moving almost every year until I was closer to 10 years old) has limited me and my relationships all my life, I've literally had no idea why people would want to talk because I'd never had conversations beyond how was school and what should we have for dinner and did you walk the dogs already. It's still hard for me to grasp the ways in which other people think and what they're like - I've always been keenly aware it's not the same way I am, I'm that observant at least, but past that it's been a total guessing game and I was never very good at it. This in turn probably made people just weirded out enough by me to not want to be close friends, although most would still treat me very nicely so I thought this is probably how things are supposed to be. Now I'm wondering if this indeed is the case and I simply didn't get the chance to develop these skills, or if it's totally normal to not have talked about proper topics with anyone and not having had friends outside of school and I'm just looking for excuses for my own shortcomings again. Looking back, my friends were all next-door kids and classmates who I'd hang out with because it was convenient and because there would be too much fuss all around if an adult (usually a teacher) thought I didn't have friends. No one wanted to hang out with me after school as soon as I was too old to be hanging out with someone just because they live right next door, and since early teenage I've gotten used to always being alone and doing everything on my own. It's not really a conscious choice I make, it's just what's ingrained in my nature by now because there never was an alternative. This still hinders my ability to make and keep friends because it never occurs to me that they might want to do things together that really don't require more than one person (Because, you know, it turns out people just like to be in each others' company. Not something I experienced growing up but it seems to be true in many cases) and just hanging out without an appointed activity has no added value to me over text chats but everyone else seems to think text chats are worthless and put in no effort or consistency, which in turn makes me feel like they don't like me because text chats have always been my primary means of communication. This is just one of the things that's been bothering me lately. I can't help feeling like a lost case and a hopeless loser but I do also realize part of that is my depression and anxiety talking. I'd like to hear other experiences, did you people have actual conversations about topics other than the daily scheduling when you were growing up? Do you think that helped you understand what other people are like and how they think? Thanks for your attention to those who read all this, I needed to vent a little bit and sort out my thoughts. "
nven1i,"I don’t know anything anymore. I’ll be 25 soon. I was diagnosed with social anxiety at around the age of 10. I’ve had help with a psychologist years ago and it helped me a bunch, but lately I just feel terrible. My self esteem is hitting new lows and I’ve had body image issues that last to this day since I was a kid. I stand in front of the mirror for 15 minutes before I force myself to leave the house. I passed by a dog today and I exploded with love and I kept a straight face because I was afraid of how the dog owner would react, I feel like every time I go outside it’s just a blackout, as if everything is happening at 3x original speed and only when I get home my brain realizes what the fuck just happened. It’s like I’m living life on autopilot. Damnit. I’m just afraid of people, and I’m sad the adults who raised me have let this happen. I’m so jealous of people who just live life while I’m just fighting my own brain everyday over and over again. I’m fucked."
gi8ah2,"I want to go outside but I'm anxious. I just got a new bike and I want to ride it everyday but everytime I even think about doing it at that moment (just going when I want) I get anxious because I feel very awkward just cycling around the neighborhood alone, without a clear purpose. As if people would know it and find it weird. That's why I don't go on walks or jogs, even though I love them. So what do I do? I find excuses. Oh, it's too hot. It's too cold! The wind is howling, it'll be annoying anyway. You don't have time, you've got an online class in 3 hours, you'll be late! Shit like that that helps me feel better that I don't go outside. (plus the occasional scenarios in which I die) How do you deal with this? I usually can do it just fine if I'm going with a friend but right now that isn't an option. Tl;dr how do you deal with anxiety about being outside without a clear purpose?"
f8347yu,My parents send me to Africa when I was 15 and I thought I was going to come back before the first day of school. Which was a lie and I ended up staying there for 2 1/2 years. When I came back I was today in private that if I didn't go I would have graduate HS easily with the pace I was going. I also lost scholarship offers is why but after I heard all of that I didn't want to go to school anymore just going into I hate my life moment. Still didn't graduate HS sadly and I don't play baseball anymore because I always get flashbacks of getting tricked by my parents.
dwtxux6, I'm like this at work. We all have open benches that we work on with our personal Spotify and I keep my shit whisper quiet because I'm afraid of people judging what I'm listening too. Meanwhile everyone blares their music with no worries. 
e0v0mm2," It was a slow process tbh but I’ll happily give you the deets 😌 I started studying a new course in university and in Germany where I live there are normal universities like in the US and universities that are similar to colleges/schools. Soo it’s not anonymous and you do group work and talk to many different people. Most of the people I met there are 23-30, quite grown up and really nice and friendly. This really helped. But honestly I came to realise that 90% of the people are friendly, you’ll find cool people too haha. Practice makes perfect. I had to read a paper called ”Toward a Unifying theory of behavioral change“ by Albert Bandura, one of the most famous psychologists. This paper changed my mind. It’s on self-efficacy and I highly recommend you to read it, too. It made me realise that the others aren’t better than me, it’s ME that’s in my way. My way of thinking has been stopping me. It’s constructed, it feels very real but it isn’t. My thoughts (about myself) weren’t true. It’s similar to disgust. I personally am disgusted by certain insects others let on their hands. Why am I even disgusted then? It’s constructed too, they’re not objectively disgusting. This made me realise I’ll have to change my way of thinking in order to stop my anxiety. Bandura refers to snake phobics in said paper but I guess it holds true for us too :) ohh I don’t know if you’re a student so I’ll give you some tips on reading a paper efficiently: don’t read the mathematical part. Unless you’re interested in understanding it, it’s complicated and they’ll explain what it means in other parts of their paper. Read the abstract, maybe the introduction and then the discussion. You may want to read Bandura‘s whole paper tho as it’s more of a summary than a study. Moreover, I read so many papers on social anxiety in general using google scholar and my university‘s access to specialised literature. I read how social anxiety is defined in modern psychology. They say it’s a fear of rejection. But what really happens when you get rejected? Nothing happens. Try and ask people some really dumb shit like ”what’s the name of the queen again?“ and they won’t be rude. They either won’t know either or happily tell you the answer. And you’ll notice you didn’t die. Feelings pass and feelings can’t kill you. I also read up on the fight/flight/freeze response. How does it work? What happens in your body? What exactly happens in the brain? Your adrenal cortex and sympathetic nervous system are trying to defend you from danger but there isn’t any danger. I read studies that found social anxiety is fueled and maintained by rumination. If I now find myself ruminating about sth I could’ve done better, I try to stop thinking about it. I don’t judge myself for these thoughts, I accept them. I know that this is what has kept my social anxiety alive and that’s why I want to stop them. Read up on other factors of social anxiety. It’s fun reading these tbh, these scientists are really spending their LIFETIME to gather knowledge on us and write as if they wrote about animals. It makes it sound really adorable. Learn about neuropsychology in general, it gave me sooo much love for humans. Humans really are pure. There are people out there who are so curious about social anxiety they actually do research on it. Isn’t that sweet? They’re curious like a child. Here I am, writing to a total stranger how I got better. Isn’t this really kind? I don’t want to brag or sth but this is how humans are. Adorable. Several people upvoted my post saying I got better. Again, adorable. Another thing that helped me is trying to stop judging others and seriously understand where they’re coming from. Chances are you’ll realise they’re very similar to you. And humans really are sweet. Well, most of them haha. Nobody knows what they do but here we are on a planet that revolves around a fireball. Maybe you want to read Nietzsche on amor fati. Reading about it on the internet or watching a video on YouTube should suffice. Additionally, I watched others‘ presentations. I watched these gorgeous people turn red and they were so nervous, too. What for? They too are either afraid of rejection or getting poor grades. This is so pure, again. I didn’t even think of thinking a single bad thing about them, yet they were afraid of others‘ judgements. They all nailed it. Some girl asked the audience a question, nobody answered for like 3 seconds. We didn’t have the chance to think it through, it was a difficult task and our brains aren’t that fast. It’s interesting haha. She got nervous and immediately explained it herself. I found this really sweet and it made me like her even more. I wouldn’t have thought she would get nervous, she always seems so confident. Watching others, not in a creepy stalking way but watching them to understand them makes you love most people. How could you fear something you love? Become a gentle observer of yourself. You’ll have to feel all the feels. You’ll have to feel as if you’re going to die and realise you won’t. Take care of yourself and time to rest up. I‘m not anxiety-free but I now love to push through it. It really gets better and it’s worth it. I was clinically depressed just 6 months ago.. but life is great. You can really do whatever tf you want, how cool is that? As hackneyed as it sounds but really put yourself out there. Get hurt, get anxious and get over it, you’ll be fine. Did I mention we‘re living on a planet that revolves around a freaking fireball and that has a moon that moves the oceans? What’s life really. I guess science really gives me a love for life haha. Allow yourself to feel what you’re feeling without judgment. Ohh and please only read scientific papers, not this Freud and Jung psychoanalytical bs. I study psychology and there are many reasons this isn’t taught anymore Edit: you won’t have to talk much about yourself if you’re too afraid in the beginning. Try and actively listen. Ask questions. To understand others, not to impress or anything. Get to know them. Everyone loves people who can listen. Don’t try to think of what to reply, just listen. Just be a decent person and you’ll be fine. "
o8jkfs,"I think I’ve reached a new low. So I haven’t had that many friends in high school and I have finally graduated. My one friend invited me to a going away party and i decided I might as well go, even though I’m not good with groups. I didn’t want to be the asshole. So I get super anxious a few days before and decide that I don’t really want to go. I try to say that i’m sick but we were going somewhere and she couldn’t get a refund on the thing. So I go anyways. Skip to today, I’m in the car with her, her dad and like 4 other people. They all seem to know each other but I don’t know anyone. I can’t talk at all because i’m utterly paralyzed with fear of talking and embarrassing myself. I said maybe 10 words in the hour it took to drive. We get to the place and i talk a bit more. Then there was the car ride home. I didn’t talk. at. all. I guess karma caught up to me and I got super nauseous with a headache. We go back to her house for a party and Im there 10 minutes and not talking to anyone and people are ignoring me or giving me weird looks. The food gets here and i decide i need to leave now. So I say my goodbyes. I gave her a hug which is normally hard for me to do with anxiety and I thanked her parents, who also gave me weird looks. Now i’m sitting on the curb outside her house and i feel like an asshole. I just wish i could have talked."
ergi2yp," I’m so sorry you’re feeling so lost and alone. Can you switch therapists or find a new one ? It’s absolutely okay to do this. They’re their to help you and give you strategies to improve and if they’re not, it’s okay to move to another. The right therapist can make all the difference. There is absolutely hope for you. It just starts with the smallest of steps. Like switching a therapist, or simply going for a walk once a day etc. Is there anyone in your life you’re comfortable spending time around ? If there is it might be helpful to open up to them about how you’re feeling so they can support you a little more. Going places with somebody else can help you feel safe in the situation but expose you a little more to the outside world. Even just chatting to them on the phone if you can, can lift your spirits. Just remember that it’s okay to feel the way you do. It’s okay to struggle to go outside. You didn’t ask for this and it certainly isn’t your fault that it’s happening to you. You’re worth as a person is not based on how often you leave the house, or whether you’re going to college etc. Try not to compare yourself to others, as you are not them and they have not struggled through the same things you have. "
fs7srl4, Just consider how lucky you are to have a friend that's wants to spend time with you. So many people on here don't have any friends and it kills them inside. You should consider doing stuff with them that you enjoy doing. Like if your an indoors person watch movies together. Or go to the park together. Having a friend is a two way street and you gotta meet them in the middle. You don't have to do what they want to do but you could still hangout doing something you like. Otherwise you definitely will lose them 
fcmrdxd,"I Agree,I'm 13 and my parents always say that I'm scared to go outside and that I'm useless. I tell them that when I grow up I'll leave home and move in another city but then they say that I'm even scared to go grocery shopping and that I'll never leave the house."
hz5m8q," quarantine has made my anxiety so much worse.. I have always had pretty bad social anxiety but since I had to leave the house, go to school, run errands, etc. i got used to interacting with strangers, but since I haven't had to go outside like at all it has got so much worse. I can barely walk outside without my heart racing and being panicked (I live in nyc so the streets are always crowded). It's upsetting realizing all the progress I made is gone. "
jb0wks,"Fearing it's too late. So I'm a 23M, and I've just had something of a quarter-life crisis. I've always been reclusive and socially anxious. I had bad experiences with other children when younger (fights, being chased, laughed at etc.) but through high school I had a good circle of friends, we were always doing things or playing online, people thought of me as funny and charismatic. Somehow I even came close to a relationship with a girl, but I was too scared to push further. However, when I was 17 I was diagnosed with Chron's Disease, and it really fucked me up. I was in pain a lot, tired and couldn't control my weight. Numerous embarassing symptoms emerged, medication made me sick and I became riddled with health anxiety. This was also the age where my friends wanted to go abroad, move out or go out partying, and although they asked me I was always too scared to go with them because of my condition. I didn't even think about moving away to university, and stayed at home with my parents and commuted to the uni in my hometown. I became a total shut-in. Alienated most of my friends, pushed away people who tried to become my friends and just worried constantly about my health. I remember visiting Pompeii with my parents, somewhere I'd dreamed of seeing, and *all* I could think about was 'what if this weird mouth ulcer is cancerous?' I was too scared to keep a job, too scared to pass my driving test, and too scared to attend the diminishing number of social gatherings I was invited to. I made one friend at university in the final year, it was 90% his effort and now he's moved away and joined the Navy. I got help for the health anxiety. I found a good therapist, got the Chron's under control and I've finally stopped worrying. In-fact I couldn't even see the word 'cancer' or any variation thereof without performing some weird OCD ritual. But with the fog clearing, so to speak, I've looked at my life and realised I've basically wasted 6 whole years of it; I have 1 friend left, who I rarely ever speak to, and who I think is tiring of trying to invite me places. I have never had a girlfriend or any sexual experience whatsoever. I have no hobbies. I'm overweight. I'm unattractive. I haven't had any adventures. I have no anecdotes to tell. I've been abroad without my parents once (school trip). I can't drive. I've had one job for a grand total of two weeks. I can't stomach the thought of moving out. I have no idea how to talk to the opposite sex. I can't even play online games because of the anxiety. I'm a fucking failure and I'm so, so, *so* lonely. I'm watching all my friends getting relationship experience, settling down, marrying, buying houses, starting families etc. I'm terrified I'll end up alone forever, and it's looking increasingly likely. Everywhere I look, from movies to books to songs to adverts to reddit to those strolling down the beach holding hands, people are happy in relationships together, and it's hard not to feel like the hunchback in the belltower. I have fantasies about being in a relationship; not even concerning sex but just cuddling with someone, laughing together, comforting eachother when we're struggling, and when they dissipate I find myself inconsolable. I just want to know I'm not totally worthless and that I can be loved. ^(God, how fucking pathetic does this read?) I tried downloading dating apps and managed one date, which quickly went nowhere. Likely she saw how fat I was compared to my picture and told her friends she was catfished. Everyone on these apps has pictures of them socialising, visiting exotic places or working in exciting careers, and they're so many leagues apart from me I feel like Captain Nemo in the fucking *Nautilus*. Why would they be stupid enough to swipe right on a loser like me? Even if we do match I have no idea what to say, how to impress someone or make them laugh. And how do I take them for dates when I've hardly ever left the house and can't even drive? The only reason I was ever close enough to the girl in high school is because it was high school, we were literally forced to see eachother for six hours every day, where else can I replicate that now that university is finished and I don't have a job? Reading dating advice I'm told to join clubs, go volunteering and make friends first, but it seems an equal number of users on forums tell me that they've still failed to meet anyone doing these things. Fixing my myriad problems would take years of effort, which I'm prepared to do, but even still the odds look so disparate it doesn't seem worth it. Even if I can become an attractive, well-travelled social butterfly at somepoint in the future, what woman is honestly going to shack up with someone completely inexperienced at that age? It already looks weird now. Besides, my anxiety would only mean I'd fuck up any intimate relations we did have. If you're still reading and haven't cringed yourself into oblivion, I don't know what this was for. More of a vent, but if you have any advice, or you can relate I'd really appreciate it. I don't see a way out of this, and I'm having more and more thoughts about doing something drastic I can't come back from."
fefq2q," How often people stare at you in public places?. I get stares all the time when Im out side on the streets or in any place where there are people, there might be times when someone dont stare at me and gives me a normal look which gives me shock as I dont expect people to look at me or treat me in a normal way and that would give me some confidence but again people will stare at me even from longer distances, I know some of you might think that these might be my illusions but no, this is the truth even the only friend that I had in my life when we were outside have asked me "" why everyone is looking and staring at you? "", This is serious, I dont known what is wrong with me "

hbxbuu,"I am tired it’s taking over my life. I hate having social anxiety. I’m faded as fuck right now and I thought it’s a good idea to right about tibis shit. I’m faded because I’m trying to make it go away. Social anxiety has made me so depressed I can only sleep at night by getting faded as fuck and take a sleeping pill till I knock out. I can’t even look people in the eyes. I’m a short girl and I’m 17 almost 18 years old. I live in a crowded ass city Los Angeles. I fucking hate having social anxiety and ocd, i wake up in the morning all ready in a grey cloud when it’s sunny as a mf. The first thing I think of is how I have to hide the hickies on my neck before I walk out my room so my parents don’t see, which by the way I get the hickies because I am probably a sex addict I fuck too much because I am honestly an attention seeker. Sorry my grammars fucked I’m too faded. I was raped a few months ago by this stupid motherfucker. I guess I am anonymous anyway so I can write anything and get it off my chest. I told him no and he dragged me to my room by the arms, I grabbed onto the door frame to try to stop myself. He pulled down my pants and I kept pulling them back up, and then did it. I feel sick because of it every time it crossed my mind. I feel so alone even though I have a lot of friends. I feel ugly because I think my nose is too big and my lips are too small, I think I’m fat even though I am 104 pounds I’m 4’8. I want my Tourette ticks to go away it’s pretty draining. I always feel like I am 2 breaths short of where I should be. If that makes sense, you’d understand it if you were faded, I’m faded asf. Anyway this is my rant. I wish the ocd, Tourette’s, sleeppills addiction, insomnia, body dysmorphia, depression, anxiety would go away please. If there’s any god out there in whatever dimension seeing this, please please mushroom lord take it away. I just want to have a lot of attention from a male human cause I got daddy issues. I just want to be able to enjoy sex. I want to be able to not be afraid of intrusive thoughts when I’m in public. I want a smaller nose. I can prostitute for money so I can actually have money to get a liquid nose job but I don’t wanna ruin my brain prosituting. I could be a stripper but I donno how to twerk. And I got alotta scars on my legs from skating. If anyone sees this I wonder what your thinking gives me anxiety rn. I’m too faded to give a fuck so imma post this, kinda made me feel better to write about it than hoard it in my mind."
difhp5a," i go on jogs and i sometimes even nod to others, especially other runners "
e42cdn6," Just to give you an idea of how absurd and fragile my problem is (nonetheless extremely painfull). The other day I was with friends in a bonfire. I was making jokes and everyone was laughing hysterically. Then a friend took the spotlight and started making jokes that made everyone laugh hysterically. Boom. I had a panic attack and my night was ruined (seriously not joking) Took my jacket and went home to watch Youtube for hours. It seems like a I am a controlling bastard. I despise it, but it happens so automatically that it is also difficult to blame myself. It amazes me a lot that in middleschool you were reading self-helping books. It seems to me that phase in life doesnt involve too much socializing, all the little kids are still in their own world. I am from Mexico and highschool is definitely not far from what is portrayed in the movies. I think what shocked me the most was that boys and girls began having relations and I was still very inmmature. There was also a lot of bullying and a very competitive enviroment, worst years of my life (so far). Your trip to Asia and the cultural shock it gave definitely does not seem rare to me. Did you bring home the SA that it produced you into your college? The placebo effect you mentioned is also very important, just as it helped you, it might sometimes work the other way around negatively. Thanks for listening! "
fngpmhh,"He was my next door neighbor for a few years before we noticed eachother. I approached him, asking to run with him in the mornings.

We also have an almost 5 year age gap. Me turning 25 this year and him 30."

I mean I really do like the amount of confidence but I feel that it is more detremenral than good. I am just way in too the toxicity of these sites. I have been hurt over again and again and it's because of these sites and apps.

jhel34,"Guy (37m) I (24f) was dating says I'm too anxious. Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'll try to recount everything from my perspective, I would really appreciate some honest answers on this as I've been desperately trying to wrap my brain around it. So I meet this man, and for the first month its a whirlwind of dating (lunches, dinners, sleepovers, hiking, etc.) and sex. Lots of really great sex. Everything is fine til the last few times we see each other. List of incidents: \-For context, we've seen each other at least 10 times prior to all of this. One time he snapped at me for hugging him one morning, saying I was needy like his dog and was stressing him out so much. This was without any warning, but of course I stepped back and respected that boundary. \-He gave me chlamydia, and disappearing for a week until *I* asked how *he* was. When I confronted him about not checking up on me, he said he felt really embarrassed. \-The second to last time we saw each other he immediately started saying my 'anxiety' was stressing him out and making him react in a very negative way. I felt super calm with him, so again, I was confused. He later apologized and said he was cranky and overtired. Then after this I saw him last night, we had great sex and conversation, and started opening up a bit more. We had a ton of banter which I guess made him reach a breaking point. We were on the couch holding hands and he suddenly gets up and starts raising his voice saying I'm stressing him out so much and he needs to take me home, and 'how many times he needs to bash \[my\] head in before I realize that enough is enough' (mind you he has NOT gotten physically violent with me). He proceeds to take me home with music blasting and at a very high speed. We get to my house and he apologizes for raising his voice while still raising it, and I apologize for joking with him so much and realized how much that could have upset him. As he usually does, he then belittled my interpersonal skills and said I have zero emotional intelligence and don't know how to interact with people or my limits and that I have 'so much to learn'. I bring up the times he's made me feel really low and he got even more upset saying I'm just doing tit for tat. Then he said he needed to go home and get a pain killer and how he can't imagine this would ever progress. I think what worries me the most is that the times he blew up there was zero warning sign and zero communication beforehand, he just suddenly starts raising his voice and accusing me of having really bad energy and making him feel uncomfortable. Is this my fault? Or is this just a sick power dynamic? And am I right in feeling confused or do I just keep messing up? TL; DR: the man I'm dating has blown up at me multiple times and I'm not sure if it's my fault for apparently being too anxious"
elggzyl," I have dogs, horses, and a lizard. I love them all but I always believe they're judging me in some way lmao. I actually got so anxious at one point in my life that I used them as practice for gaining self confidence in speaking. You're not alone, friend "
pp5hbe,"Unsure of what to do. Hi, I recently started my first year of college and I feel a bit lost. I had a group of 6 friends in high school and we spent a lot of time together, especially this last summer. I was always an introvert and had social anxiety but I also really enjoyed having these friends and spending time with them. I have now spent my first 3 weeks pretty much alone and I'm unsure what to think of it. On one hand, it has been extremely relaxing, but I kept stop feeling like I'm missing out on the college experience. My roommate, who was one of the people from my previous friend group, is basically out all day with his new friends. He has been meeting new people every day and goes out drinking basically every day too. I feel like shit every time I see him coming into the room for a minute before leaving to hang out with more people. I feel like I want to have a similar lifestyle and enjoy college, but deep down, I know I could never enjoy a lifestyle like that due to my social anxiety and introvertness. I have been going out alone to get food, go on walks, and often work on my laptop outside instead of staying in my room. It's almost as if I'm doing what I enjoy but feel like I'm missing out still. I can't really find a way to enjoy myself. If I try to be more social I end up exhausted and not really enjoying it, while being on my own makes me think about what I'm missing out non-stop."
meqlm8," how do any of you make friends online?. hey, how do any of you make friends online? i try (probably not enough) but it's just really hard, you know? i feel like i never fit in anywhere, and all my interests seem so obscure or otherwise not strong enough to make a friendship over. i try games or discord servers sometimes, but i just don't know what to say to people. i want to put myself out there but nothing seems to work well, so now i don't really know what to do. so yeah, what do you do to make online friends? or i guess real life friends too, but the outdoors are cursed and i'd probably die out there or something "
hzvlw4,"Extremely scared of my peers. Im 18 and i have social anxiety and selective mutism, I think in the past year I've pushed past a lot of the boundaries that come with my selective mutism but one remnant from my elementary/middle school days is my irrational fear of anyone who happens to be the same age as me, but more-so, people who, at a glance seem like they could be part of my social circle. I was biking yesterday and saw a 😎😎😎 group of teenagers, it was super hot and id just come from a pretty challenging route. No sweat. I was practically and calm dry, until I saw them. There was a 0% chance that they'd even come near me but I still reacted with such intense fear, I think it literally activates my flight or fight. I have pretty bad social anxiety in general but teens are where it fucks me up disproportionately a little about my life: not really necessary to understand my point. I'm Nigerian but i grew up in Canada, lived here until 4th grade and my social life was pretty pleasant, even with a bad case of selective mutism while at school, had a decent amount of friends and I was treated pretty nicely. Outside of school, I was much more socially active, I had great relationships with my parents friends kids, who were other Nigerians in my city. my school friends were more like who you'd picture in suburban canada, though. I moved back to Canada last year for boarding school and I go back to nigeria for holidays. When I moved to Nigeria, it was really unexpected, no one in my family planned it, my mother has schizophrenia and on a whim, on the last day of our vacation there she decided to skip our return flight and settle down with my dad, who before that point lived there for working visited us in canada a few times a year, it was super hard being ripped away from my old life and friends without warning and it made my selective mutism a lot worse. I was 9 years old and I think at that time you're bound to be going through a lot of growing up. I don't want anyone to feel super sorry for me for moving to a third world country or whatever, I was lucky enough to live a lifestyle that shielded me from the whole ""third world"" aspect, I went to good schools and had a good time, if we ignore my school experiences. I was definitely scared of the idea of living there though lol My selective mutism seemed to get a lot worse as I started fourth grade, on the first day of school I went through a huge wave of culture shock and cried my eyes out when I was asked to read aloud in class, so, that really gave everyone a shitty impression of me, I still remember it so vividly, 9 years later. The kids in nigeria were a lot less receptive to ""different"" people like me and that vibe stretched all the way to the people I met in high school. I wouldn't say I was bullied (I was physically bigger than pretty much everyone) but I was singled out and made fun of a lot for being the guy who ""never talked"" because the culture over there is like, boys are supposed to be outgoing and loud, and the pushback for being anything else is pretty harsh. never really had anyone reach out and try to be my friend. By the time I left that school after 6th grade my impression of Nigerian kids was that they were just plain mean. back then I had hope that id move back home ""any moment now"" and it wouldn't have to be a big problem much longer. People were nicer in my new school, but I kept to myself and was very anti social for the first year because of the impression that the old school had on me. Later I started getting closer to people , I wouldn't say I had friends throughout secondary school but I began to see the good in a lot of people around me. My selective mutism made me unable to talk to people at school but that's a whole different story. When I moved back here last summer I went to an International school. before I moved to nigeria I identified as Canadian but living in nigeria for 8 years made me 180, so when I first got to my new school I only gravitated towards Nigerians. I thought i'd gotten so past my SM that id be able to act like I never had it, but when I tried to get myself into a group, or talk to one person I felt such crazy anxiety, I went to my therapist and I started taking medication for anxiety. I had a math class where me and three other Nigerians sat together and this one girl reminded me a lot of the people I was around in secondary school; a good, cool person, but what I went through really gave me what I can only call the opposite of a god complex, I really felt like I wasn't worth enough to even be around such a person, I could barely focus in that class. I never have panic attacks but every class was the closest thing I had to one. I didn't know. why I felt like this, though, until last December, when I went home for Christmas and I was having a conversation with an internet friend; I finally cracked one of my biggest mysteries: the title of this post. Lmao im so sorry if these paragraphs felt unneeded I just really like to talk about my life :/ My fear of my peers isn't equal across the board; its much worse for nigerians who are whatever age I happen to be, online and in real life. its still bad with everyone else but that just makes it much worse. I guess im super scared that they'll ridicule me for my social ineptitude and niche interests or whatever. I felt so good when I discovered it but I really dont know what to do with this information, I've been struggling all year. I know it was caused by my elementary school experience but idk how to reconcile it or if I even have to. sorry if I wasn't clear im happy to clarify more"
dqbvto7," That sucks man. When I had depression I remember going outside and there would be a clear blue sky and the sun is shinning, inside I feel like I’m dying, like I’m being swallowed by a vast emptiness. There were several things that helped: 1. When you don’t have motivation to do something. Start small, and then build up momentum. E.g. take out the trash first. And then make your bed. And then take a shower, etc. 2. Plan out rewards at the end of the day. Like buying a movie ticket in advance, so that you have to go. 3. Use Moodnotes, it’s a CBT app that basically acts as your psychologist. 4. Make lists of all your favorite things. Like favorite food, drinks, music, restaurants, activities, people. So that when you feel sad or lonely you can always go to the list and find something to cheer yourself up. 5. Sometimes you just have to force yourself to go out. Once you’re outside you’ll immediate start to feel better. "
egef4uj,"Thanks for your reply i appreciate it. Walk do help i agree its been snowing here so getting out in the cold fresh air helped quite significantly. The problem is when i go to the store checkout or the hairdressers the attention is on me. I hate it because i feel like there is a expectation from me to be happy to greet the checkout person or be talkative at the barbershop. I had a orientation back in June for my job in a auditorium with about 100 people then the guy says lets go around and introduce ourselves. nnI was so nervous oh my god i said what i needed to say but i was trembling so bad i didn't really make any sense. I felt humiliated and didn't belong there it was crap. So in short i hate attention on me, going out bumping into someone i know, meeting people for the first time, even meeting my friends walking into a cafe nope cant do it. My aniexty is a mess im trembling, sweating, face looks so nervous i cant function like that. The worst part is my brain is telling me its stupid dont be anxious but my body cant help it. I know ive got confidence in me but i cant tap into that anymore. "
nyk4k2," 25 Short Pieces Of Advice. A lot of what I write in this post has to do with self-improvement. I believe that self-improvement is crucial to dealing with social anxiety, and that's why this post is relevant. We live in an interesting world. Despite being more technologically advanced than ever before, we face many difficulties and problems. Depression and mental health rates are rising, and happiness levels are dropping. Cellphone and social media addictions are the norm, and people are not taking care of their health in the ways they should. It is now common to live a sedentary lifestyle, to indulge in instant gratification and overstimulation, to be overcome by unhealthy foods such as excess sugar, and to live our days constantly comparing our lives to the polished profiles that we come across online. It’s difficult to make progress in life. To be great, we must be better than most people. To be better than most people, we must do the things that the majority will not. With good health, a good mindset, the knowledge, the work ethic, and the passion, it is possible to slowly improve and to one day become the people we know we are capable of becoming. Below I’ve compiled a list of 25 things we can do to improve our lives. 1. Lifting: Lift weights consistently. 3-5 times per week is a good number. Get jacked. It will help get you healthier, happier, stronger and more confident. The best fitness book I’ve read is “Bigger Leaner Stronger” by Mike Matthews. 2. Cardio: Do cardio every week, whether it’s a going for a walk, going for a jog, or playing a sport. I personally walk 10k steps per day. 3. Stretching: When lifting weights or doing cardio, don’t forget to stretch.   4. Hydration and Nutrition: Hydrate yourself daily. I personally drink at least 2 litters of water per day. Furthermore, make sure you are eating well balanced and healthy meals. Gut health is greatly correlated with mental health. 5. Health Testing: Get all your important physical tests done yearly, such as blood tests. Make sure you are fully healthy. Prevention is often more important than treatment. 6. Other Health Facets: Make sure you are prioritizing all aspects of your health, such as teeth care and skin care. You don’t want to develop problems later in life.   7. BMI and Body Fat Percentage: Make sure your BMI and body fat percentage are in a healthy range. They aren’t always the perfect measures, but they give you a good idea of where you stand. 8. Health Problems: We all have unique health problems, such as acne, gynecomastia, or a number of other things. Deal with your unique health problems as quickly as possible. You don’t want them worsening. 9. Sleep: Wake up at a consistent early time every day. Go to bed at a consistent time every night. Turn off your electronics at least 1 hour before going to bed. 10. Sunlight: Get sunlight daily. If you can’t get the right amount and form of sunlight, make sure you are supplementing with vitamin D3. 11. Mental Health: Prioritize your mental health. Make sure you are healthy and stable. If you are not, get some help and figure out what you need to do to reach optimal mental stability. 12. Social Life: Prioritize building a good social life. This includes friends and family. We are social animals and social support is crucial for our development and well-being. Take social risks to grow your social muscle. If you have social anxiety, you will lose it one day and become a natural. Make sure you are putting in effort into bonding with your friends, and that you are choosing to spend time with good people. 13. Intimacy: A healthy romantic and sexual life is important. Learn about this aspect of life and put it into practice. 14. Self-Love: Understand that self-love is the most important form of love. Be kind to yourself. 15. Mission: Make sure you have a mission and purpose in life and that you break your objectives down into SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely). Work on your craft daily. Incremental improvement is crucial. Make sure you enjoy what it is you choose to do with your time. Be more of a producer than a consumer. 16. Finances: Get a job, start a business, and learn how to save and invest your money. Financial health is important. 17. Organization and Cleaning: Keep your space clean and organized. 18. Alignment: Make sure that you are in alignment with all parts of yourself. Your thoughts, feelings, actions, dreams, and intentions should all be in alignment. Stay true to yourself. 19. Reading: Read books. Read articles. Learn from the best people in history.  Continuously try to learn about what it is you are interested in. You brain is a muscle. If you don’t train it, it won’t stay healthy. 20. Mindfulness: Understand that life is a process and stay mindful of the present. 21. Goodness: Be a good person and give back to the world. Help others when you can. 22. Environment: Your environment is crucial to your well-being and success. Make sure you are living in an environment that is healthy for you and that you are surrounded with the right people.   23. Legacy: Build your personal brand and leave behind a trace of who you are. Work on creating a great legacy. 24. Reality: Stay grounded in reality. Limit your use of electronics and try to live in the real world as much as you can. For example, go on a walk outdoors and get some fresh air. 25. Courage: Go after what you want. Steve Jobs once said, “Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you.” He was right. Be courageous. The advice above has to do with health, relationship, finances, happiness and mindset. Remember that the best way to improve is to enjoy the process and to take things slowly. If you try to implement too many things at once, you will get burnt out and you will not enjoy life. Be kind to yourself. Failure is normal. Try to improve just a little bit every day and understand that there will be some days where you will mess up. It is the intention, the drive and the daily action and habits that counts. With the right mindset, decisions and circumstances, you will improve incrementally and be better than you were yesterday. Best of luck! "
fhs0ur8," I don't think you need our help if you're brave enough to travel alone. Seriously though that's pretty brave of you. Just do stuff, get out of your comfort zone. If your sitting in your room, challenge yourself to go for a walk Meet people and have conversations. You'll never meet these people again so it doesn't matter if you think you've embarrassed yourself, they're nothing to you so just test yourself and talk. "
e9fpq7g,Im afraid of going to the gym so what I did was jogging alone and I do push-ups and abs at home. I dont have to talk to anyone. Its wonderful
gq3pxf," Jealous of nice feelings. Recently one of my family members was explaining how he went to this nature resort and felt absolutely beautiful there, how he took pictures breathed some fresh air, recharged completly, just overall had a great time there. I was so jealous. I went to the same place by myself before, it was a gloomy day but i just felt terrified anyway. I literally could not feel any other emotion than a large amount of anxiety, i was there for like 5 minutes before i quickly went home. It's like i wasn't even there physically, and mentally all i could feel is anxiety and fear. It was derealization but with anxiety, i couldn't even be there long let alone take pictures and enjoy it. it was absolutely draining of my energy. It's supposed to be a nice place but it was new and strange for me, and i went alone so it was instead absolute horror. I just wish i could enjoy obviously nice things in life. I just wish i felt anything besides anxiety, but no. I wish i could go someplace green and nice, enjoy the nature, chill, bit of adventure. But i only feel relaxed by myself, in my house. It's not agoraphobia, i can go out, i just wish it would feel nice when i do. "
dixh23i, Grandparents can be easy going. Damn a boat. No escapes that's a good solution for SA. I would just say to hell with it even if your nervous. Face your fear. Which easy to say but hard to do. Hope it goes well :) 
iqh0oz," People looking at you in public. So I live in an apartment complex. I like to be outdoors. I usually keep to just going on walks but sometimes I just wanna sit somewhere and enjoy the moment. So I sat down at a picnic table in the courtyard. I had headphones on and was listening to music. Well this person walking their dog comes nearby and looks at me. I try to not make eye contact because I haven't reached that level in recovery yet 😅 I felt incredibly awkward and my heart pounded a little. I HATE feeling noticed/looked at in public. I don't like drawing attention to myself. Anyway, I managed to sit right there and not get up and leave. But it made me wonder, what is the ""normal"" way to deal with something like that? Why do I feel so scared of strangers looking at me? "
g2nay1g," This is the recipe of disaster. If it actually happened in real life it would just make you snap, have a breakdown, a hard panic attack or something. Even compulsory military service would have to dismiss you at that point. To face your social anxiety you gotta go baby steps, every day challenge yourself to something a little bit harder than the day before. Your challenge has to be a challenge (duh), but it can't make you shiver, blush and want to quit just from the tought. Try to find what is in this range for you and start there, to some people it's as simple as order something at mcdonalds, to others is to ask directions to someone on the streets, go outside with mixed pair of shoes, and thousands of other ideas. Start from there and think of something just little bit more challenge to do next. Don't put yourself into extreme disconfort, it'll most likely do more harm than good. "
dyixr6g," 22, similar situation. I try to deal with it by being around family or pets, having videos of people talking in the background \(podcasts, bob ross, live streams\), playing online games, or like Pinkvanilla said, keeping myself distracted. Often times I do all the above at once. I find I get much more lonely the more people I'm around, so try to find one or maybe two people to hang out with. If you don't, which I'm often in that situation, pets help. Loneliness is one of the most destructive emotions, so it's important to try to keep it at bay as much as possible. If it's any consultation, I haven't had a friend for almost ten years now. I prefer animals though anyway, haha. But yeah... It really sucks, and your feelings are valid. "
dpy8ocr," Also I my point about school sports was that I quit them all bc I was scared to be criticized. I quit football, baseball, basketball, track, and golf bc every environment makes me nervous. Basic human interaction makes me nervous. "
fiw9avq," Yep. When I was a kid, I remember being the friendliest kid in the neighborhood. Every playground I went to I ended up making 1 friend that day. And I was also more outgoing. But then, middle school kicked my ass and lowered my self esteem. Then high school came in and finished what middle school started. Now I’m very quiet and more introverted then I was back then. "
eva6m8c," No doubt. Your relationship with both parents is super important because how much they teach and influence you. I'm sorry about your mom making you fear the world and others. Have you ever went to a therapist to work through some of it? It's always worth a shot. See my mom never let me go out, to birthday parties, swimming, movies, ect. with other girls through my childhood so I never had much social skills. She kept me in most of the time, while still comparing me to all the other kids and say she wished had them as daughters. Now I hate most people because I see what I can't be. "
q7r4lh,"I will start my one year journey to defeat social anxiety and depression tomorrow, and im gonna keep a diary, so in a year i can tell you how you can do it too!. DONT BE SHOCKED BY THE LONG READ IT MIGHT BENEFIT YOU! I will dedicate the next 12 months to changing my anxiety and severe depression! im sick of all these suicidal thoughts and negativity and i wanna live and boy i wanna live good and dammit i will. i spent a lot of time on this subreddit and found that its a place to vent, but actual good tips and sucess stories are rare. so i will write down any success and failure i had so i can provide a step by step guide for all of you. (if i fail miserably i will tell you that too so you know what not to do) About me right now: im a 20 year old dude, had anxiety my whole life, i have no social skills and therefore am always quiet and awkward, and i developed a phobia of going outside, i always fear i start crying, pass out, have a panic attack, throw up ect... ive been isolating from my few friends pretty well too in the last months. i have an anxiety disorder, i fear public places and fear itself whitch is a shit downwards spiral. i have awful panic attacks very often and im now for 3 months severely depressed to a point where i feel like crying 24/7. a delicate fear and sadness mix if you wanna call it that. i have developed a sleeping disorder, either sleeping 14+ hours or 3, nothing inbetween, and due to the stress i have migraine attacks every 3 days. sounds shit? its not over yet! i have lost my main mother figure at age 8, went depressed for the first time, formed a new mother son bond to my grandma to be happy for 3 years, then she developed severe dementia in one week, forgot who i am and died when i was 11 and that left me alone. but its not enough! i have 2 ptsd traumas, i almost got stabbed dead in a robbery 4 years ago, became a drug addict, did every drug known to man including fentanyl crack and all that funny shit and almost died in an overdose of amphetamine and boy let me tell you dying of exauation is no fun :). i have adhd, but people for sure didnt like that when i was a kid so i learned to become the quiet one very early, and while i might seem quiet and awkward, im just supressing my adhd, everything the normal adhd enjoyer shows to his enviroment is what happens in my head. i only got bullied actively over a one year period once, but im a foreigner in my homecountry and let me tell you people dont like that where im from and i got beaten up twice for being from another country with occasional random insults all my life. i had friends in high school that kept me sane but they going to colledge now and i cant due to all this shit. matter of fact, im unemployed, had to reject a full scholarship at a elite university in the subject im passionate about becaus of all mentioned above. in this moment its 6 am, i cant sleep, i feel like crying, im so stressed, i could just run a marathon out of nowhere because im so tense and i really dont wanna die but my mind keeps pushing suicidal toughts in. so im sorry if my english is rushed or incorrect, ive been in fight or flight mode for 6 months now thats just how it is.... oh and also i smoke 2 packs a day;) Im not telling you this to vent or to cry and pracitce self pity nor am i seeking attention. i have an important reason why i tell you all this. the reason is this: a person overcoming social anxiety will most likely not return to reddit. why would they? its not in their mind anymore. so most people on this subreddit still strggle, are depressed, vent or share their depressing view on things. its the unknowing trying to teach the unknowing so to say. (not trying to insult anyone i do this too and im definetly unknowing). in order of this many beliefs get manifested, such as certain personality types can never overcome anxiety or learn social skills, introverts will have it very hard and have to force themselfes to smalltalk and will never enjoy it anyways or certain personality types are not likeable because they are too different. from a view of someone who is suffering from these issues this might sound plausible, but i can assure you that this is pure bullshit. the brain is a complicated computer and you can programm this computer in every way you want and everyone can achieve everything with the right amount of work. so above i present you a very shitty situation, probably worse than the situation of many people here, and in one year i will prove you that even i can overcome this awful phase of 20 years. if i can, so can you, and i will tell you step by step how i did it and what you have to consider. i wanted to do this for a long time but today i feel so extrordinary shit that i think its time to start. so yeah... if you read all this... thank you:) im sorry if i sounded like an asshole at some points but as i mentioned it im in fight or flight mode fighting off suicidal thoughts and im anxious and awkward without social skills. i dont know how i will do this yet, but i will dive into it, get proper medication, see a therapist and push my comfort zone, wich is basicly my bed and not a single inch more everyday a little further. i will work out, at home now and in a studio as soon as im able to and i will slowly reconnect with my friends. also i will talk to one person a day thst isnt a service person even if its cringe. i will inform myself in the process and i will try to forcefully fall asleep now and as soon as i wake up its on. i declare war on my awful life and after writing this i feel like conquering! encuraging words are welcomed, critic is welcomed, advice is welcomed, rant is welcomed. and everything else:)"
g3jayt4," I can also add I do live a good life minus the no friends thing, i scuba dive, surf, fish, workout. I keep myself busy but cant build sustainable relationships "
dwxycgw," People can be nasty because they are really insecure and are flailing for anything easy to make themselves feel better. One time on the train there were these two handsome gay men clearly in a relationship. I was on my way to a concert with my girlfriends. I was a junior in high school and desperately insecure of my body. All of my friends looked amazing in their crop tops and tiny shorts, and before leaving I spent like two hours panicking over what to wear. Nothing looked good on me, and I couldn't pull off going out clothes like my tiny friends. I was tall and curvier (not fat, but not small). Finally I threw on black leggings, a white tank top and a black leather motorcycle jacket. It wasn't my favorite outfit, but I felt relatively OK and just wanted to get to the concert. So finally feeling somewhat comfortable on the train, I notice the two gay men are looking at me. I was trying to smile at them (because this was around the time I was coming out as bisexual and felt unity with anyone queer....something I've learned with hindsight isn't really a thing unfortunately, at least not really). Then one of the men says something like ""I didn't realize Shamu was going to be making an appearance on the train today,"" while looking disgustedly at me. At the time, I had no idea what ""Shamu"" was, but just based on the way he made the comment, I knew it was something mean about me. That alone put me in a sad, frustrated mood for the concert and I wasn't much fun, but eventually I got over the mean tone of the comment. Then the next day I was telling my friend the story, saying I didn't know what ""Shamu"" was, but it didn't sound good. He told me to Google it. It was the killer whale that lived at Sea World. The random man that I was trying to smile at on the train said I looked like an orca, pretty much to my face. I was 17 and so insecure of my body, even though my BMI was fine. That still hurts and I'm 22 now. Now whenever I see — or briefly consider wearing — outfits with a black jacket and black pants with a white top, I cringe. Like I said, people can be nasty. But they're the ones that have to live with themselves. "
fiyp9tw," I usually do walk outside every day to and from class for at least an hour. It's a big school so there are people everywhere and I'm not too bothered by it. I don't like making eye contact though because it makes me feel vulnerable and it feels insanely awkward. Do you have any advice for how to push through that? Also for surrendering to it, do you mean not thinking about it and just letting my reactions naturally happen? "
jsjekh,24F I only have social anxiety with girls. I get really bad social anxiety with new people I meet but more so women I meet. I am in a relationship and straight so it’s not like a crush thing. I started taking my dog to the dog park and noticed it there I feel much more comfortable talking to the guy dog owners than the ladies...I have no idea why. Most of my friends are men... it just occurred to me that maybe this is why. Anyone know why this is a thing for me?
decyzva,"it's not just comedy but also romantic/slice of life/coming of age/feel good/drama type movies and shows as well. nnrecent examples for me would be The Perks of Being A Wallflower, The Breakfast Club, 500 Days of Summer, MoonlightnnMad Men occasionally nnThe OA with the interpretive dancing was cringe AFnnin terms of comedy then The Eric Andre Show can be a big one, IASIP as well, Parks and Rec, The Officen"
khn2h7," Used a payed bathroom without paying. I don't know if there is such thing in other countries, but here in Brazil if you're not buying anything some restaurants on the beach requires you to pay in order to use the bathroom. I used one today but didn't pay for it because i got too scared of talking to the clerk. Now i'm freaking out about it and i don't want to walk in front of that restaurant ever again. Not only i feel ashamed but i'm also scared that they might do something about it like giving me a fine or whatever. It's probably no big deal because no one said anything as i went outside, but i'm still paranoid. I hate how mundane shit like this can turn into such a pain on my ass. Such is life with SA "
cvu1uk4,"I think wanting to say it is a good enough reason to post it. It's really good that you have the attitude at the beginning of the day to want to try and improve yourself. That alone is something that a lot of people, myself included, struggle with.nnAll I can say though is to keep trying, eventually it will get easier. A goal I set for myself in the beginning of my journey was just to go for a walk around a park and say hi to anyone I passed. It might sound lame taking baby steps in the beginning, but eventually those steps grow on their own."
f312zy5,"sounds like you tried going 0-100. It’s not something that will happen overnight. I’ve been working on getting out of my shell since senior year of high school, now a senior in college. I still have a lot of insecurities, but I’m much better than I was by trying to challenge myself a few times each day. You’re basically retraining your brain. This is best comparable to exercise. If you try to run 5 miles tomorrow with no prior training, you’re going to pass out. But first you try running 1 mile, then 2 miles, etc. Then after a period of time you will be able to run that 5 miler."
danhprj," Im saying that you will never get better if you give up or if you just wait for the skies to help you. You have to try to find a solution for your problem. I'm sharing something that actually helped me and lots of other people with the same problem. Sure, maybe it wont help you very much, but its for sure better than doing nothing. And as a ""magical solution"" I was reffering to an effortless and quick solution. Anything that will help you, even if its not meditation, will require effort and commitment. Yes, we have this problem and it sucks. But now what? if you dont think what I suggested works, feel free to suggest sonething. A therapyst? Medicine? Well, if this works and makes you feel better, why not? Just dont do nothing And, as I said, you WILL eventually have to ""just do it"". Even after years with a therapyst or taking pills. You will have to do it. Maybe you cant go to a fucking random person and start chatting, but you CAN do something man. If just going for a walk around your block, even if you dont speak to anyone, is out of your comfort zone, that absolutely great. But you cant just wait forever, untill you are 100% confident to start to do anything, because this day will never come "
dl0141x," I'm in a ditto situation - its just like you copy pasted my feelings! I'm a healthy 24 y/o, in a new city and a small one too. I have everything that i could desire for at the moment - a great job, money, nice car , freedom but with a zero social life. I just sit in my apartment all day long listening to music or surfing youtube. I don't drink so going to bars and pubs just doesn't work (I've tried it) i look like an idiot sitting in a pub by myself sipping on water or whatever and my colleagues are all much older than me with families so socializing at work isn't for me. The core of the problem : i just don't know how to make friends and i don't feel comfortable around strangers "
fnazinv,"I’m also 17, from the Netherlands, and scared to try and get my drivers license. the thought of being evaluated by someone next to me in the car is killing me and O haven’t put any effort into getting my drivers license while like almost all of my friends have it already. I lived in the states for a while and there the need is a lot bigger for a drivers license since here you can bike everywhere or take the train or bus easily. and also it’s not weird at this age to not have a drivers license."
en8bffu," I like to go bike riding, I also like to play video games and watch TV series.. shit life really "
eaav2i," Avoiding* a friend i miss bc i dont like his gf what i do. Im not seeing my friend much at all anymore (its been a month) bc i dont really want to hang with him knowing his gf is going to be there. Im not even really sure why i dont like her. Maybe its bc shes like fake nice and always plays the like sympathy card. Also i just dont trust her at all, i know she just outright lies. Shes also no shame in being like not independent or self sufficient, like being a freeloader. she just wants to coast through life. I dont know like how can i keep my friendship with this guy. I miss hanging out but like they are inseparable and i just cant with her. She requires too much attention and i just dont have the energy to pretend with her. I dont know. What would you do? like its hard enough to be in social situations without having to deal with these types of people. It makes me sad. Anyone can relate? "
fib6g74, Yeah man just go for a walk every day for a few weeks and it’ll get easier. 
qslqy4,"I am genuinely so terrified. I have to go to a first aid thing you need to be able to get your drivers license. It’s 7 1/2 hours tomorrow. I don’t know how I am supposed to be with other people for that long. I already had to go outside today so my social battery is absolutely drained, I am already extremely overwhelmed right now and I already know how uncomfortable I will feel the whole time. If it was like four hours then I’d be fine with it but 7 1/2? Plus I’m going there alone so I will probably be forced to socialize. And I will have to eat there too, I literally can’t eat in social settings I hate it so much I don’t know how I can survive tomorrow. I can’t even cancel it cause I already paid 50€ and wouldn’t be able to get those back if I don’t go."
45vtfi," OK so a shitstorm of things happened today.. Context: 16 y/o bi male (mostly straight). Grade 11 5 minutes into school, fucked up what was supposed to be a high five and turned it into a handshake the shape of an armwrestle. This happened twice. Then later, I was showing my new website (Computer shop) to a mate, and he said that it looks good and very professional. I had the intention of saying thanks, but the words just didn't come out. During sport, we were playing basketball and i made so many mistakes. 95% of the lost points were due to me fucking up. I could only catch the ball half the time, as my reaction times are shit. When i did get the ball, i just stood there frantically racking my brain deciding who to throw to. I know one guy in the team was actively trying to pass to me, so i don't feel left out, but everyone else skipped me because they knew i'd fail. Just for reference, i put in 200% effort, and i still couldn't be of any use to the team. It wasn't fun either, chasing the ball back and forth for 120 minutes. I also felt very guilty when i did mess up, and covered my head in shame saying 'fuck' or 'ooohhh man' Another thing that happened just last week is the group i hang out with after school (at the bus stop) (in same grade as me), we're planning to go to the beach on friday to hang out and have coffee or afternoon tea. Everyone around me except 1 or 2 were making plans to go down there, and i felt hell awkward. I really wanted to go, but what if they had pissed all over me for asking? No-one gave me an invite so i assumed they didn't want me to come. This same group got together this afternoon for a group selfie. I'm not a very social-network person, as I only have a facebook for news and messaging, and no other social networks. I find social networking a bit over saturated and life-controlling (adopted necessity to take photos all the time). anyway, I hesitated to jump in front of the camera as everybody else was, and then my best friend Josh jumped in. I went in and the selfie was taken. Now my only fear is, i wasn't asked to join, but i did anyway. I don't want Tim, an acquaintance, looking back at the photo and thinking ""Why the fuck is Nathan here?"". Also, i walked past a rather cute girl my age (whom i know and have talked to, but not much) while leaving, and she was untying the Aussie flag in the school. She looked at me and smiled. I looked away, failing to make eye contact. I looked back and she was still smiling at me, and it took me so much effort to smile back, but i did, for the first time in my life (To a girl, excluding my mum/sister). It was a pathetic smile, and i quickly broke eye contact again. It felt so... awkward. Just a sidenote, I've struggled with depression before over a span of 6 months (in 2015) and am making my way out of it. Seriously these things tick me off daily and the happen every day. I'm sick of it. Any advice to help, similar experiences? Sorry for the long rant, but im just super pissed at myself for being so pathetic and awkward. "
d39fm9,"Kind of need advice.. So where do I start I’m 15f for reference. So let’s start back when I was in grade 6 so elementary was really good for me but then when middle school hit it kind of all went to shit. Me and My “best friend” at them time (and on and off after that) made a little friend group in our class as you do. Anyways everything was alright but about at the end of the year is where I got rough. She basically turned my whole friend group against me it was 4 girls. Which ok sounds shitty but that’s not even the worst part. I don’t know if any of you know what a sports day is but it’s something we have in Canada, anyways so at the sports day our whole class went anyways so she then turned almost my whole class again me. It was just me and this one girl (she was part of our friend group). Anyways so the whole class was on one side of the bleachers and me and this one girl where on the other (I can’t remember if there was anyone else I think there was but idk). Anyways so the whole class was just laughing and snickering at me the whole day. And I didn’t do anything to this girl I was just her “friend and that was it”. So after that year I went into home schooling it was full time except for 2 hr classes twice a week. And so over that year I developed major what I think is social anxiety or something like it. It almost came to the point where I couldn’t even walk by a group of girls or anyone who looked like they where in there teens. And in grade 8 I entered this program in the school where it was 2 full school days a week and I was ok at that but it was just kind of like grade 7 but the 2 days a week thing helped my anxiety cause I was with kids my age. oh and I also lost my Athletic ability in that time. But I started to go to the gym and now I can go 45 min on the elliptical now. But that’s besides the point. Oh and in grade 8 and 9 my grades when from almost straight A’s to cs and bs. We didn’t reconnect until grade 9 where we were actually really good (just one on one) no drama or anything like that because it was just us so what could really happen. But she told me that this program (that I was still in) was lame and that I shouldn’t care and to Judy come to here school. (Or that’s how I felt like I had to act around her) but I realized that it was a really good thing for me and grade 9 even tho my grades where bad it was still an ok year. And my anxiety was doing better to as I made myself go out and be with people so I forced myself to get exposure. But then grade 10 hit when my mom sent me to the high school that she was at. She made me think that I would just be part of her friend group without any trouble at all. And so I believed her. But then not 2 days into me going there she started to act distant and then I asked her if we where ok and she said yea we where bit that I should basically fuck off and find a new friend group. So I went back to home schooling not 1 week after entering my school. So now I’m here trying to get my grades back up. I feel like I’m at square one again. I work at a McDonald’s and it’s good cause I’m with people my own age and stuff but there’s this really nice girl and I think that we can be friends but I always feel like I’m so Awkward around her. I am always quit and I feel like she is just taking pity on me. I got her snap and he just started talking. It’s frustrating because I know it’s not true but still. I’m just trying to get myself out of this pit and I was doing really good in grade 9 but then she had to come back and screw it up. So basically I’m just gonna work on getting my grades back up this year and then maybe go back to fusion in grade 11 but I would like to go to this really cool sounding high school is kind of musical, but I really do love to sing and all that and that girl from McDonald’s goes there but I think she’s a grade higher than me but it’s small than the other high school was and I think that it would help a lot. But I think I need to get my confidence back in myself. Can anyone just get any thoght from this and if u have made it all the way to the end I thank you really. I kind of want to start a support group for people who have anxiety (or at least think that do) Just so we can support each other and help each other (I’ll be making another post about this idea later today but just private message me or comment ur snap so I can make the group."
dizk8q9," Oh man that sounds horrible, luckily for me it never got physically threatening. In a way I let them bully me because I really didn't know how to handle it. They made fun of me because I didn't like sparkly water, because I was vegetarian, I wore used clothes etc. I remember one time after I left the changing cabin when we went swimming with the school, one of them went into the cabin and screamed ""eww, smells like (name of my hometown)"". And another time when we where on a school trip one of my classmates told everyone that he saw my penis while peeing and that it was big (I know huge deal 'irony off', but at that time ANYTHING that made me ANY different would embarrass me to death) . Thinking about it now it seems silly that it affected me that much, but during that time I felt so unwelcome, that I started interpreting every glance, and every sentence as a personal attack. I felt so embarrassed as soon as someone would just LOOK at me that I wanted to disappear from this world. During that time I started fearing going to school too, I had a stomachache so bad that I couldn't go to school at least once a week, and when I was I school I was very conserved, walked around with my head down and kept to myself, all while fearing to be seen by anyone that could make fun of me. "
msry7p,"I thought everyone hates me. But today, I haven’t seen some people from school for 75% or the year and I thought it would be weird when they came back in person. They all said hi to me and talked to me. Some girls came up to me and it was a nice day. During lunch, some girls asked me to come over to them outside and sit with them for like 20 minutes. During gym, I guess he’s my friend now, he asked me to play basketball with him. Math, everyone said hi to me. The popular people talked to me. And I still feel like garbage and still feel like everyone hates me? Why? What is wrong with me? Everyone was acting nice to me and I still felt bad on the inside? Why is that?"
qokalt,"Its so crazy how people can be the nicest people one day, and be total jerks the next.. So we have this old woman neighbor who was always super nice to us when she saw us and our dad in our back yard. I remember just a few months ago when he mowed the back lawn, she and him would have long conversations. She even gave us bags of goodies for our mom. Well, tonight (technically last night cus at the time of writing this its 4:21 in the morning), that all ended. So we wanted to spend father-son time by having a bon fire/cookout. Just me, my little brother, and dad. We have this sunken in spot in the ground where we put charcoal and logs for the fire. We were all sitting, eating little Caesar's pizza and roasting marshmallows while listening to classic country music on my dads tablet. It was so relaxing and nostalgic. But it all ended when we all went in the house to use the bathroom. I was the last one to use it, while my dad and my brother went back outside. When I got done and went back outside, I saw the neighbor lady in a pink night robe talking to my dad. She was yelling at him about the fire, saying how ""it was right next to her garage and she has gasoline in there"", and other stuff like ""that could catch fire on trees and kill people."" Now, its one thing to complain about someones bonfire on their OWN property but then she out of the blue started attacking us for our religion. She told my dad ""You say that your a man of God yet your having bonfires that could kill people"" (Like, bruh, how is having an innocent little bon fire a sin? Whats even funnier is that she was cussing as she said that. Whats even more blood boiling is that she was frikin invading our privacy by holding her phone camera up to dad FILMING HIM!. She said that she ratted on us to the fire department and they said they would talk to us and my dad said they never did. She then brang up the time my little bro smashed her garage window with a baseball by accident. At the time my dad went to her house and offered to pay her but she said it was totally fine, but tonight after complaining about our fire she said ""And ye' break my window and dont say anything about it"" (Like I said, At the time my dad literally went to her house and offered her money, but she declined). My dads a peacemaker type and he hates confrontations so he was keeping his cool and nicely saying ""ok, we'll put it out"" But she wouldnt let us go. she kept saying stuff about safety and crap. because of my social anxiety I was cringing so hard That I was nervously shoving gramcrackers down my throat. Me and my dad were SHOCKED! Its like she was drunk or something. her personality changed 360°. Its almost as if she was bottling it all inside her all the previous times we had fires, and she snapped."
987sf1," Why do i have no desire/intention to speak to other people, keep friends or make new friends.. Im making this post, because im not sure if i suffer from SAD or not. So heres my situation. I am 20 and im a student at Uni. I dont have any friends, any social contacts other than my parents. I usually just sit home and play video games, read books, learn for Uni, cook for my parents, care about my dog. My only friends are online, on Discord. All in all my days when i dont have Uni feel are very empty, but it does not really bother me, i enjoy being alone and not having to deal with any stress caused by others. I am in a tennis club and i enjoy the sport a lot, my teammates are nice, but i dont engage with them outside of the tennis court at all, i just dont know what to talk about with them. I think thats my main problem. Whenever someone tries to talk with me i just give short answers, i hate small talk, i literally feel super awkward every time, i start getting self conscious and start stuttering and sweating. It has been like this forever. I have troubles with holding eye contact. I constantly get told by my parents/relatives that i need to get out there and start engage in social activities, but i just feel absolutely no desire to do so. I am happy with being alone, i feel secure when i am at home and can do my regulare day-to-day schedule, i cant stand when i gotta do extra stuff, it regularly freaks me out and i get alot of stress, especially if it has to do with social engagements. I got no problem with ordering food, talking to a waitress or anything like that. I just cant talk to people about personal thoughts, i never know why people talk to me anyway, whats their intention. When im in Uni and i got a group work i really dont mind sharing my thoughts about the topic with colleagues, but i never actively get chosen by ppl or chose someone else to work with, im always the leftover guy. Everyone acts nice because they are professional inside the class course. I also absolutely hate crowded and loud places, it completely freaks me out and i start to stress alot and get a mental blockade. I never go to any University summits or bigger events therefore. I read alot on this subreddit and i cant really tell if i got SAD or smth else. I see alot of you being upset about being the lonely guy and actively try to build up social relationships, but you fear of being judged, i dont have that. I just dont really care or wanna know what others think of me. Others always feel weird when im close by and i notice that, but i cant change it its just the way i am. I know for sure though that i got something weird going on with me. "
ewqsyy5,"i did quite a bit to prepare, the day before i biked for 30 to 40 mins to reduce anxiety for the next day. usually i bike atleast 20 mins nearly every day, cardio is probably the most important for anxiety but combined with mindfullness its very potent. practice mindfullness (atleast 20 mins a day). i practiced for 40 mins maybe the day before. then i drank chamomile tea so i wont wake up from anxiety, still did wake up from anxiety but i got back to sleep. since the chance of someone approaching you and introducingthemselves to you is very low, you have to bite the bullet and do it yourself. remember theres always peope who are not so talkative or whatever. but keep at it. start of with handshake, name blah blah. and then ask what they did before college and how old they are etc. ask the most random stuff. usually them talking about college or work usually leads to something interesting. and its OK to have awkward silences now and then in a convo, thats normal. idk how i got good at convos, i just told myself that im the shit and im not scared, i asked pretty much anything. I made myself curious about the person. it is also important to SMILE, thats a key factor to showing that you are friendly and such."
94n6zu,"How do I meet sober/non party animal friends?. Ever since I was in college I used drinking and partying as a way to socialize. 25yo now. Realizing that partying isn’t very fulfilling and the hangovers make my anxiety a lot worse. I’m looking make friends who aren’t all about partying now since I pretty much only party with my main friend group and we don’t really do anything else together. I’ve thought about organized sports or cooking/dancing classes, but I don’t want to pay a bunch of money or commit if I don’t feel like going sometimes. Some things I like to do: Camping/hiking Simple exercise - driving range, tennis, jogging, cycling Seeing shows &amp; films Reading fiction novels Video games &amp; TV (trying to get away from this stuff though since it isolates me without much benefit as opposed to reading or listening to podcasts) I’m still fine with drinking the occasional beer or glass of wine, but I want to get away from binge drinking. Thanks so much"
eyw323e," There's nothing outside that I like doing, and I'm too young to live alone. "
groq0c," I've never spoken to anyone else with social anxiety as severe as mine - It's made me feel more alien than human for most of my life. Even though I know social anxiety is very real and common, I still feel alone. Even after reading posts in this sub, I still feel like my social anxiety is way more extreme of a case to just simply be social anxiety. I am not saying this because I want to feel special or want pity, but because I finally want to come clean to other humans who may have similar struggles as me. Maybe in the process someone out there reading this can relate to my symptoms as well. I'm just gonna make a bulleted list. Here goes: * **I haven't ""hung out"" with anyone but my boyfriend, his parents, my parents, and my grandparents since 2017**. Yes, that is correct. I am a 23 year old female college student that has not spent any quality time with anyone but these people in 3 years. I have had a couple friends online that I have spoken with through text, but no hanging out or video chatting. No voice calls either. And due to anxiety I can't make a decent impression in an interview so I don't have coworkers to talk to. Nothing. Even most of my classes are online now because of anxiety so I don't even have a friend in school. * **Have never been able to present a project or read in class without crying or fainting:** I am 23 years old now and not once have I been able to get up in front of a class and speak or even real aloud from my seat. Not even in elementary school. I know, this sounds dramatic. But the second I'd walk up there I could feel my legs shaking. My heart racing. Sweating. The nausea. My jaw would lock up. If I even dared to start talking my voice would be shake and my words would turn into alphabet soup. Then the tears would set in. I can't tell you enough how many times I was accused of being too stupid to read by other students. Or how angry teachers would get with me as they pulled me into the hallway and told me this had to stop. In college, I was denied being able to sign up for the special public speaking session because I didn't meet the disability requirement. On my first day in the regular public speaking class I told the professor how bad my anxiety was. I made it very clear that he would need to work with me on this and I would try my best to write a good speech. **Long story short, I passed out during the first speech of the semester, had to get stitches on my head, and was immediately withdrawn from the class. I lost my scholarship due to being withdrawn from the class. Even the next year when I took the special section that was sit-down and only had 9 students, I would tear up, shake, and stutter every time I spoke.** * **When I try to speak, I can't. The words come out in the wrong order, are stuttered, or I simply forget every word. People have asked me if I was drunk before because it takes me so long to get anything out.** I was almost completely mute as a kid. I had to do speech therapy at school. I was pretty old when I started being able to communicate in sentences with teachers and other staff, but even then it was terrifying to interact. My parents were so confused by this because I could talk to them just fine as a kid. As an adult it has just gotten worse. I do get nervous speaking to my parents now, but it is still easier than speaking to anyone else. I have bombed every job interview I have attempted because the second I open my mouth to speak I can feel the tears well up. The words disappear. I feel faint. I end up speaking in a shaky-on-the-verge-of-tears voice and broken English. The few relationships/friendships I've had are with the people who were okay with me avoiding eye contact and writing letters to them/typing things out and showing them until I felt comfortable speaking in a more intimate manner. Currently I only have two friends that I can speak with and not get so nervous that I forget every single word. * **I avoid pictures of myself, even though I love taking pictures of other people.** I have opted to not have my picture in yearbooks, to not be included in a lot of pictures at family gatherings or college events or award ceremonies, etc. I have been working hard getting fit this past year and have been trying to convince myself to upload my progress pictures online but...I just can't. And when I change up my hair or like my makeup or do something fun, I wanna take a selfie, but it feels wrong. It feels gross. It feels like I'll just be annoying to everyone who sees it. * **I can't eat in front of other people without getting sick.** * **I have always tried to cover as much as my face and body as I can in order to go out in public.** I have always tried to cover most of my face by scarves, masks, glasses, etc. in order to go grocery shopping, drive in my car, go to class, you name it. And I have never worn a bathing suit or shorts in public. No one but my current boyfriend (who is one of the two friends that I can communicate with decently well) has seen my bare legs in years. Even on vacation on a remote beach, I was scared to unwrap the towel from myself and get into the ocean because there were families in the nearby distance who could see me. * **Eye contact is very painful and I can count on one hand how many people I can maintain eye contact with.** I want to look into peoples' eyes because I WANT to be close and kind with people, but I can't. It hurts. It feels like it's too much. It feels like I'm vulnerable. I feel like I might scare them. * **Driving is hard because it is people inside cars, so the entire time I drive it feels like my heart is racing like I'm at a dinner party, but even worse because cars can be deadly, so it's like a social gathering made aggressive.** * **Picking the skin on my hands since I was a toddler:** It started when I was about 3 or 4. Every time I would go anywhere in public - restaurants, groceries, daycare, dance class, even play dates with other kids, I would pick the skin on my hand until I bled. My parents were obviously really concerned that their little girl was doing this. Doctor after doctor just told them it was anxiety and kind of brushed it off. Now as an adult I have scarring on my hands and still pick them quite frequently. I picked them all throughout school and college, and still do if I'm outside and other humans can see me. I do try to stop myself when I notice it. But my brain is so flustered and cloudy in public that I rarely even realize it until I'm home. * **Wearing plain clothing with no designs in front of others so they can't judge me for what I wear or like.** I actually love cute dresses and creative fashion and my band t-shirt collection, but no one outside would know that. So I have been questioned why I dress so boring my entire life. * **I have not been able to hold a job.** I attempted working retail/fast food in high school and usually had my first panic attack/crying/fainting event within the first week and was quickly disliked as an employee because I couldn't communicate with customers. I've only had one job that was understanding and moved me to an office job in the back. Since leaving that job I have been unemployed for nearly two years, even with a bachelor's in Computer Science. Because I bomb every. freaking. interview. * **I love recording music and singing, and do it all the time, but have never posted it. In fact, No one but my family and two friends even know about my musical abilities.** * **I've tried to join numerous clubs and organizations** and ultimately quit after the first meeting due to the reactions I would get from others when they heard my shaky voice and could barely understand a word that came out of my mouth. Even the ones at my college for people with anxiety. I was always the worst one there and always felt judged like I was a freak of nature or crazy because of the difficulties I have communicating. * **Can't play multiplayer games online.** I love video games and used to at least be able to play with other humans since there was no face-to-face contact, but those days are long gone and I can only play single player games. Nothing PVP or anything fun like that anymore. So here I am, at 23 years old, working on a Master's in Computer Science that will never be used because I can't pass an interview. I've tried SSRI medications and they did absolutely nothing or made it worse. I am in therapy twice weekly and can barely even make a word out to my therapist because of my issues, so even then I end up just writing her a letter and watching her read it and attempting to communicate any further questions she has. I feel like an empty shell. A computer program simply meant to exist. I feel forgotten and it is no ones fault but my own, but I don't even understand why I have always done this to myself. I feel alone. I feel like cases this extreme do not exist. I literally daydream about being able to smile at a cashier and tell them to have a good day. I wish I could have friends that I can have lunch with and take cute pictures together. I wish I could go places with my boyfriend without fear of being looked at or needing to speak out loud. I wish I could post my vacation photos showing off my fitness progress in a cute bikini. **I wish the words I want to say would come out of my mouth the same way they do on paper.** "
g564943,"At the exact same position as you. im trying to stop seeking validation from other people. from so much people pleasing i have repressed my actual personality sometimes its pretty hard figuring out what to say, i end up saying nothing, for example a guy at work jokingly teases me i dont have a come back, i just smile and get back to my work, i get bitter at my self and thinking they will just view me as a ""beta, or weak"" idc what they think as much as its what i think.. i used to be pretty shy, now going outside doing whatever that makes me feel life as long as not hurting others. and yes i made a friend online, she was like 45 and im 19, she said openly, she is really interested about my culturr and i would share stories about it.."
fqzkos5,"If being adult and have no close friend is problem it's means I have that problem too because I am 22 years old and still can't find any potential close friend. I think in a point that ""ah.. it's fated, I think meeting people is a fated like I have meet a hundred and a thousand people but can't find any people who have same spectrum vibe w/ me but I think is okay we can choose different way to enjoy life.. Problem about speaking and have interaction with people. This is wat I think how about you try to Join in a interests community and try make a friend in there. When in outside why not try to make a pleasant little move like you smile on people when they make eye contact with you (it is a culture in my country, we smile even at stranger but maybe its look like insulting for other countries)"
esps5mi,"I don't know how to talk to people. Yeah I got my SA 10 years ago at the age of 15ish. Cut pretty much all of 9th grade, my mom even got threatened police on her. Or the thing one level under police idk what it is called in english. I live in Sweden. Because of my stutter I've been pretty much mute unless to those close to me, I got a small group of friends in my childhood but now they are gone. Now I need to be drunk to talk to my one internet friend I still have. Used to go to this facepunch forum where I got a bunch of friends. Still have one, well two but one I actually talk to. In 6th grade and before that I had a lot of friends but.. since then it just cut of. I was the creepy guy, no one liked me, then I got all the negative thoughts in my head. I'm weird, I'm fat, I'm weird, I have this thing no one likes to hear... My mind was filled with millions of bad thoughts it felt like. I remember feeling the SA first when I was at a train station, I sat at a bench on the platform there and that is when I first had all these SA thoughts in my head. That guy right there is thinking I'm fat and ugly. That girl right there saw how wweird I was walking.. it goes on. From I was 15 to now 25 I've been prretty much isolated. I've gotten help sure but apart from that small part of help every wewek I've been stuck in my own room and now apartment (though an assisted living facility. So I've lost my endurance, social qkknowledgte and everything.  and#x200B; I've said this in so many threads. So many friends have lost me. I know I lack social knowledgte and skills.

I play video games a little, but not enough to be considered passionate or to have a conversation about them. I'm not interested in going to the gym or exercise. I hate reading books. I don't like drinking, smoking or doing drugs. I don't travel or do outdoor activities or take classes because of lack of money and I live in a country where all the activities are in a language I don't speak. I'm not interested in girls or dating in general and I'm not interested in cars. Can anyone suggest topics to talk about?"
fx5wyib, Thank youu a lot. I quit soccer literally like 3 days ago...I told my dad no. I didn’t tell him why. So that option is gone. I still go skating because it’s the only thing i enjoy that not many people in my city do. This one good friend at the skatepark who’s always playing a game of skate. Super encouraging and we literally just skate all day with the rest of his crew. But usually I’m always asking him or talking to him. I haven’t seen him in about 2 weeks because his brother got arrested at the park and he was misidentified. (Another problem I hate. Discrimination.) and now he can’t go back until I don’t even know but I’ve been skating by myself recently. I have these 2 friends at my school who skate (one of them was my childhood best friend) and we haven’t skated together but I’ve been in touch with them regarding my progress. Skating is the only thing I’m confident about. It brings me a lot joy. Along with the usual frustration. But I love it. I skated for like a a year or two when I was like 11. Quarantine made me want to get back into the hobby after 6 years. Best $170 dollars I’ve spent. 
qkp9si,"I kinda have a group of friends. So I’ve been hanging out with these people, they’re nice and I’m starting to notice how they see me as one of them somehow. They call me to hang out almost every day and I’m invited to their parties and birthdays. I feel more comfortable with them than I did before, like last summer when we went to the mountains. I didn’t really know them that well and I ended up having anxiety attacks and feeling lonely, those kinda were the worst days of my summer. Now, when we go out it’s ok if there are not too many people talking around me (like more than 6-7). In these moments I still feel like i’m not actually there and I simply not talk because I’m so overwhelmed and don’t know what to say. For New Year’s Eve we’re going to the mountains again and I’m feeling better about this, but I’m still worried that maybe it will end up like last time, because 6 days in a place full of people sounds overwhelming. Still, I definitely feel more confident this time and somehow I’m looking forward to it. I went to a therapy session once, for social anxiety and the therapist was actually more of a psychiatrist who only had a few people to counsel for this type of therapy and she told me what I have was not bad enough for her to help me. She recommended someone else to me, but it’s been a while (more than a month) and I still haven’t called the other therapist. Now, because it’s been better lately, I don’t know what to do, if I should call or not just try dealing with it on my own. Maybe I’ll regret it, choosing not to go.. I don’t really know what to do, I’m worried and somewhat happy right now, but still afraid not to fuck it up."

hftmuwb," Hey. I understand your feelings. Your exact emotions and thoughts. We all have here. Welcome to the club now that you've seen what the depths can be you can know the difference of an upside. If you want some advice. It's in the thoughts. You can't stop them. Don't try. Imagine and endless stream flowing down a creek. The trick I've found is that you have direct control of the pale you dip into the stream. Problems are worse if we give them a lot of weight. Your pale is submerged. Don't to follow one thought out. Ride it. Random thoughts dissolve into nonsense. Pure unresolved nonsense. They don't help a whole lot at a certain point. Did I check the mail? Is the door locked? Yeah do those. Those are practical. Thinking about your negative interaction a week ago will not help you in any way at all. You have to strip that thought. Dip out. Easier said. I've found focusing on basic things helps. This takes practice but meditation helps me. It helps shed it. I don't care what the lady thinks because she screws up too and she knows she's done that too. If you stop making practice of how you screwed things up you won't worry as often. Everyone fucks up. What if, what if. They don't like themselves so you're the target. They don't deserve your thoughts. "

But i feel like its so much bigger than the one i drived when i got the driving license (citroen c2) And im just scared to sit and drive im scared that i will fuck up the car,or i will hurt someone,or do some dumb shit on the driveway and everyone will look at me like a complete idiot. I really dont trust myself enough.Its 2 years since a have a driving license and i did not drive at all. Im 22 and im still riding a bike every friend of mine is already riding a car."
nvk26k,"Can anyone help give me a little direction? I have a very screwed up life.... Any serious no bs advice would help... I have some sort of insane social anxiety. During highschool I lost a lot of weight, made friends, and was genuinely happy. I loved working out after that point and met some great people in a 5 year long running/training group I was in. But about a year or so after highschool... I just started to isolate myself. Like how me and my family would do in middle school. I slept most days away, gained weight back, and let a whole 3 years drain away inside my house. I completely forgot who the confident, sociable guy I became in highschool was. I turned into a heavy unkept mess and became scared of the outside world. I didn’t want anyone to see who I became, so my bubble of things I would do shrank. My anxiety peaked and even talking to someone over the phone made my voice embarrassingly shake, so I stopped doing that as much as I could too. Now I’m trying to change with as much effort as I can, but it still seems impossible. I’m very stiff in public now. At jobs I’m normally singled out and talked down pretty openly about. The depression saps me of my energy, coupled with my nervous voice and awkward stiff way of moving. So I haven’t had a job in a long time. I thought maybe I should bite the bullet and try getting one as a cashier. Maybe cold turkey constant interaction would help? I had an interview for a position like that the other day, but they haven’t gotten back to me yet. I feel like in person they could see a lot more of my life problems easier Is there any hope for change at this point? What should I be doing in anyone’s opinion to mature out of this? I know this is a pretty nasty story, but that’s just how messed up my life is right now.. Thanks for any suggestions posted"
gwzcjn, Anyone else’s Social Anxiety make them feel they aren’t making the most out of life. For example being the “quiet” kid in class because you can’t make the courage to talk to someone or in any social setting really. I’ve always wanted to be able to talk to anyone and not have that awkward silence constantly because I panic about what to say in a conversation. Not sure if I’m the only one but I feel like I could go outside more and have fun with friends more often but I never like to leave my room even to see my family because of the fear of consistently being judged all the time. Even in the future as time goes on i feel like social anxiety will massively impact my life such as getting a job or making new friends etc. Thanks for taking the time to read this have a great day.

de2ea0s," well im no master on the subject, but id say aim for something fun, and some good food. Have a plan of what you are going to do, but be flexable with it. If you want to go the movie route, find out what time movies are on and what ones she/you might want to see, but if you want to get to know her you cant really talk much during a movie. not knowing how old you are, id say do something fun like visit an arcade or mall or mini golf or something fun to you and doable where you live, but not too expensive. To get to know them the point is talking, so anywhere you can do that will work. Good luck bud! "
jtfu83," I went to the mall alone! This time last year, I couldn't even go outside alone.. This is my first post here, and I just want to tell you all what just happened! So I needed new boots for the winter, so I had to head to the mall, because there's a shoe outlet store there. This time around last year, I could never have gone to the mall alone. I would freeze in place as soon as I left the house and have a panic attack. But today, I went straight in, still with my heart pounding like crazy, but I managed to buy the boots, and even asked the worker there for help finding a specific pair. After buying the boots, I managed to go to a few other stores, and managed to ask for help where I needed to. It's amazing! I can't afford therapy, so I never thought I'd get so far. But leaving a toxic environment, and living on my own with my boyfriend has helped a lot. I still can't have full conversations with other people, I can't ask strangers to move if they're in the way, or anything like that, but I went to the mall alone! I still can't believe it myself. "
p5qv94,"Need ideas to overcome social anxiety. I feel like I’ve gone back to where I was before my therapy last year. But now my anxiety seems to have turned into anxiety and depression, because now I’m full of regrets about how my anxiety caused me to miss out on stuff at school. I’m also fed up because my friends (aged around 23) are getting on with their lives, getting good jobs, graduating, getting their first house. I feel like I’m miles behind everyone else as I’ve not done the things they were doing five or six years ago. I’ve never been anywhere other than my nearest town on my own, or anywhere at all with friends. The furthest I’ve gone is to the park to play football a few times. If I go to the doctors again they’d just advise CBT again but it’s more deep rooted, I’ve had the anxiety all my life. Does anyone have any other ideas on how I can try and get past my anxiety other than CBT?"
4yr1bl," Different Person in My Head Completely. Everything I've ever wanted to do has just never happened for me. Social anxiety, having no job, no money. Can't really do anything. I'm very talkative, very social once somebody gets to know me. But I am never anywhere social, so I have 0 friends online or off. I've always wanted to be a singer but have never sung in front of a single person. To anxious to even post a video of me singing. If I was social &amp; had money I would get a motorcycle. Theres this harley shop I use to walk by alot &amp; could see through the window. Don't have much knowledge about them but have always admired every bike that goes by.

exmaxlb,"I can describe what I did. I used to be absolutely terrified of women and I was extremely needy around them. This was because I cared way too much what they thought about. Rejection was devestating to me. So what I did was over a space of a few months approach 100 approach (strangers) at parks, cafes, school, clubs and talked to them and asked them out on dates. I got rejected nearly all the time, but I reduced my fear of rejection dramatically, felt far more comfortable talking around them. Now I'm more assertive with them.nn Girls are not going to make the first move, so you're going to have to learn to assert yourself and show what you want, take risks.nn I suggest you do this rejection practice to get over your fear of rejection and to improve your social skills. In tandem with this, read the following booksnn(1) Intimate Connections by David Burns (it's based on cognitive behavioural therapy but oriented towards dating, relationship stuff. Excellent book. ) nnMy advice is hard, but it's the best and most effective way. If you do this rejection practice, you can end up making an almost 180 degree turn in how you relate with and feel around women. nnPush your ass!"
9aq2z2," My social anxiety comes and goes.. I have struggled with SA for my whole life and I am 20 years old. I have noticed a pattern that helps keep it at bay though. As long as I stay social, meaning going out with people and talking to them at least every day it actually disappears from me. On the other hand, if I stay inside for 4-5 days in a row it's back in full force and I get very nervous every time I have to go outside of my house, even just while interacting with my friends. I am so happy I figured this pattern out, but the hard part is I must force myself to socialise every single day even if I really want to stay inside all day and do nothing. "
ikmehk,"I had an awful day today. 24M. Been struggling with SAD for a long time. I’m not sure why I’m making this post, I think I just want to talk with people who understand. I feel like I’m two different people. As soon as I’m thrust into a social situation: my eyes tear up, my words have no weight, I stutter, I say dumb things - I just don’t feel like I’m me. And it breaks my heart. I just wish I could be ‘me’. I’ve tried everything. I run everyday, I lift weight weights regularly, I’m on Zoloft and take beta blockers, I read CBT books. I’m sick of being the person I am in social situations, why can’t I just be normal. I will never give up and I understand for whatever reason, fate put me down this journey. And I’m proud of myself for battling something that you can all imagine is a terrible burden. But god it’s hard."

I'm scared of someone from my old school seeing me, and also where's the fun in going alone while also being very anxious. I don't really do much else then going to the store then laying all day, being on my phone. I ran out of things to see on my phone. Social media is not a good thing for me, i realised.

ftdh6x1, Yes I agree. But where I (and I asume you as well) are suffering from is a social anxiety *disorder*. It’s only a disorder if affects your everyday life till a point you can’t function normally. Unfortunately there isn’t a support group which splits the ones who experience social anxiety and the ones with a disorder. It there is one I would be glad to know. For me personally it’s gone so far that I can’t even walk in the store anymore and taking a walk is extremely difficult due to the fear of not being able to hold a conversation. 
dtbdb6q," I could have wrote exactly this when I was in my last job. All I can say really is try your absolute best to stick it out. I quit and became long term unemployed, really not a good place to be. I think if you can find a productive way to use all the anxious energy, a sort of positive distraction like going for a run or going to the gym or swimming or something, whatever you're into, straight after work each day. Try to find something else to focus on like a personal challenge or goal / target outside of work. Maybe that will lesson the amount of time your spending thinking about everything. Also exercise/fitness is really good for mental health. Maybe invite some of your colleagues / coworkers that you want to get to know a bit better to do some sort of activity that you enjoy outside of work like if you like going paintballing or to the driving range or bowling or bouldering or something it could maybe help you bond with them. As for the stress of the work itself, I think if you just keep on keeping on and doing your work consistently you'll eventually increase your pace and achieve more in a shorter space of time, keep at it, it might just take a little while to get up to a speed where the stress of the work will reduce a bit, what is the job? I hope it all works out for you "
a82avh," how do you fight the necessary public spaces. travelling from place to place on foot, by bike, and by bus all present challenges. i prefer biking because im not surrounded by people on a bus, and passing by walkers goes fast. but this winter i need to get to my therapy appointments on foot or by bus, and im honestly terrified. i hate walking by people and feeling anxious at EVERY PERSON. i overthink everything. did i look at them different because they were attractive, did i look at them different because of their skin color, did i do something weird, they're judging me too so i should judge them no i shouldnt thats dumb and mean, etc. but sitting on a bus is constant anxiety, feeling every movement i make is magnified and noticing every movement of others around me and assuming they're reacting to me somehow--its borderline paranoia. so i dont know how to do it. ive been avoiding scheduling therapy because im afraid to even get to therapy. and im 24 and without a car (and a license, i failed my test twice at 17 and sorta gave up figure fuck fossil fuels anyway--guess why--hesitation). oh and thats the other thing, i get anxious passing by cars when im on foot or on bike, possibly even more anxious or at least different because i often cant see the person behind the windshield and see how they're looking at me, or if i do happen to look at them i somehow feel like i invaded their privacy, seeing into their car's private space. hopefully ill be riding my dad's old big tire bike that he didnt take care of (left outside, probly rusty, but maybe usable) for winter riding but still, i still get anxiety on my bike, and every time i have to go somewhere it s a battle. besides getting from place to place, the other necessary public spaces, such as grocery stores, are another thing ive avoided. i live with my parents and my mom does the shopping (another long story about how i dropped out of college because of anxiety/depression/etc, i feel like a failure and have regressed into a teenage mentality being dependent on them), but i want to go with (without looking like that 24 year old that still lives with their parents, another deterrent to going with) to pick out stuff for myself (without feeling too leechy for eating a different diet than what they make for themselves, another guilt factor). so idk how to cope, ive just taken the anxiety as a given, a constant practically.

p4ic7y,"Social anxiety with parents. 21 and I want to be independent and alone so I can heal my trauma and anxiety and feel good about myself but have to deal with two crazy people. I shouldn’t be so angry because they are both very nice people and respect my space but they are super fucking annoying. Step mom is the most annoying, she has the loudest ear piercing voice and she talks to me like I’m a dog or a child. I just want to do things on my own in silence, like make food in the kitchen, take care of my dog, go on bike rides. They are always talking to me, telling me to walk my dog, yelling to each other from across the house. I would be completely responsible if I was alone. The only reason I’m not always responsible is because they exist lmao. It’s a paradox. So I stay in my room most of the time, and they think I’m depressed or lazy but I’m really just avoiding them. I try all the time to not think about it and enjoy my day but I can’t as long as they exist. Like what the fuck."

Sure I'm still a nervous anxious mess but today i went to the store all alone, I looked a cashier in the eyes as he handed me my change, I smiled at people who made eye contact with me, I exchanged a little small talk with another mom at the park. That's something 2013 me wouldve been really scared to do but I did it and that's improvement. Even the smallest change or the slightest bit of effort will get you closer to your goal."
f9onjg," people really notice me. So i’m at a new school now and this is my third week. I’ve been sitting outside for lunch for a few days now since the cafeteria is too stressful. the main thing with social anxiety is that you think people are looking at you and judge you while in reality no one really cares that much, but i’m really tall and new to the school and people have told me people talked about me. i see a lot of people staring at me and this makes me really uncomfortable. i can’t even try to tell myself no one pays attention to me because i stand out so much and a lot of people actually do now. i wish i could wat during lunch or sit at a table. people have invited me to their tables but i’m too afraid and when they offer i can’t say no so i just mumble and let the conversation fade away in awkwardness... how do i make any of these problems go away or lessen?

46z53i," Trapped in the country, suck at small talk, battling low self-esteem from childhood.. Hey Reddit strangers, 23 year old guy that's lived with his retired parents his whole life as an only child. Graduated from college on the Dean's List in 2014. Looking for work with an employment councilor and have gotten some action in the last few weeks. Stuck in a rural area, 20 minutes drive from a few mid-sized cities. Father's family were farmers, my mother likes the quiet. I hate bugs and outdoor stuff is not really physically possible for me. Been so bored ever since I finished school. I have online friends through fan sites but they're all in different countries. I get out of the house regularly, but just to shop and do errands with my mother. Recently took a personality test and found out I'm the rarest of the 16 types, an INFJ. Its really bang on, very private person hard to open up but the people I do care for, the bond I have is beyond words. Feel misunderstood by others a lot. I have cerebral palsy in my legs. I can walk independently and use stairs with a railing, but its instantly noticeable to all who see me. I was a quiet kid and knew my legs were different but I didn't realize what that meant until age 12 when I was forced to use a Walker at school. The reason I got at the time is it would help me navigate crowded hallways safely and the basket would help me carry my books. It cleared a path, but also cleared everyone my own age away from me. I think we know what happens to kids who are different. For 6 and a half years (I took an extra semester of high school to stall for time before college) I literally carried around a reminder of how ugly I was. It's taken me a long time to try and get my self-esteem back and I have hopes of a relationship now, but I also don't know how to build basic friendships first. I still feel like I'm that ugly Walker Freak when approaching strangers. I mumble, stutter or talk too fast when I'm nervous making it worse. Didn't know how to make connections in college, most of the people were older then me and had their lives way more together, a number of single moms. I didn't really fit in even with the Walker gone. As a kid I only had 1 friend a girl. We had a falling out when I was 12 but started speaking again in the last year of high school. We dated for a few months in late 2014, it was the happiest I've been in a long time. She ended it but due to her own feelings of not being ready and OCD issues, she hated hurting me. I was hurt pretty bad but don't hate her and am past wanting her back. But I don't know how to meet knew guys or girls for even basic platonic stuff. Because of the leg CP I can't use the brake and gas pedals. I'd need hand controls in a car. March-May 2015 I tried to get them at a driver rehab. After 10 lessons and $1800.00 of inheritance money from my grandmother, they failed me. I've fought with the government for over 8 months to try and get a 2nd chance driver rehab place to test me for hand controls and finally got in. It's expensive as hell again but I can afford it. Had one lesson that went well, another one this Tuesday. There is progress, but I don't know how to make conversation well. After the usual pleasantries I can't think of anything else to say. Even if I got a phone number, what do I text someone about? My hobbies are either solo or online stuff. (Reading, analyzing and debating the meaning of television). Hate sports, can't draw or play any instruments. I'm also embarrassed about relying on parents to pick me up and drop me off places and that I live with them. I holds me back from going places or even inviting people up. I have a few Facebook friends from college and high school but I don't know how to get a dialogue going and I always think they'll not want to come up to this rural area just to drive me somewhere. And its hard for me to trust people after feeling horrible about myself for so long. If someone likes me I think they either are just being nice out of leg pity or they want to use me for money or something. Anyone have any hobbies or places I could go to meet people? How do I make conversation? Get over my own mental blocks to getting to know &amp; trust someone? TL;DR Dependent on parents to go places, embarrassed about that and my leg disability, don't know how to talk to or trust strangers. No idea even where to meet people. Need advice to get out of this shell. "
nimj39,"The dreaded question: “How old are you?” AKA I think I’m going to start saying I have a ‘growth hormone deficiency’ so I have an excuse for being so undeveloped. I haven’t been asked this in so long, mostly because I’ve been isolating myself a lot (not because of covid). Today at the barn I ride horses at, a girl who always helps me out asked me my age. When asked this, I always say “A lot older than you probably think” to try and ease their inevitable shock before I tell them my age. I said that, paused, and then said “I’m 19.” Ugh. The reaction is always the same. “Oh...WOW. I thought you were 12!” (Sometimes they say 13 if I’m lucky...) I never developed during puberty. The only physical change was menstruation, body hair, and sweatiness. I never grew after 6th grade. I started developing breasts in middle school but they never actually turned into anything, so I don’t normally wear bras since none of them fit. I have 3 bras to my name. All too big for me, but they’re padded push-up bras and I wear them in hopes that I’ll look at least 12 and not 10 (I’ll wear them in classes or at the barn, etc.) My voice often gets mistaken for a little kid. When I, on the rare occasion, meet women around my age who are my height, they always have a much deeper voice. You can tell their age usually. I know everyone thinks their voice is high-pitched and annoying, but I do voice-recordings all the time for classes. I’ve gotten used to my voice and I know what it sounds like. When I was 14, my doctors had me tested (bone x-rays and blood test) because they were so concerned. They found nothing wrong with me. My relatives are relatively short but not to my extent, and relatives my age don’t look like little kids. And I’m so fucking sick of the “teehee, you’ll be glad when you’re older!” I get from middle-aged women who are miserable with their wrinkles and gray hairs. When I was 14, people thought I was 12. When I was 15, people thought I was 12. When I was 16? 12. 17? 12. 18? 12. 19? You guessed it, still 12. I’m screwed. I don’t even have good skin genes, it’s all thin and easily sags around my mouth (thanks mom), so it’s not like I’m gonna be some rare beauty when I’m older. There is no upside to this. I’m tired."
7pugnq,"Ready for change. I've posted here before but really didn't get much advice so I'd like to give it another shot. nI was a very shy, quiet, polite kid. All my teachers used to talk about how sweet and kind I was but, for some reason I always had a hard time connecting to other kids. I went all through elementary school without friends. I had a few in middle and high school but, I never saw them outside of school. I never went to any parties, school functions, camping trips etc with them.I essentially grew up alone. I'm now 25 and still live with my parents. I have a steady job and am going to school but, my life is extremely boring. I always feel like I'm missing out on life and I'm not doing the things I want to be doing. I have practally no social contacts outside of work and I'm always lonely. I was able to keep myself busy and content with my hobbies but that's not working anymore. I feel desperate to change my life and fear I will spend my whole life alone. The funny thing is I seem to be a very likable person. I get along well with everybody and am not afraid to talk to people. My problem is I seem to lack the ability to turn aquauntices into friends. I really want nothing more right now than a few close friends but, I am not interested in the things most people like. I have very unusual interests which I feel makes me a little different than most people and maybe even a little quirky which I'm proud of but I'm so tired of the isolation and sadness. I want to feel like I belong somewhere and like I'm loved and accepted how I am. I've never had a girlfriend or been in any type of a relationship. I honestly don't even know if I want a girlfriend. I have very little attraction to women but, see guys all the time where I think to myself ""wow he's cute"" and things like that. I think I am more likely gay than not but, I don't want to be. I want to get married someday and be a father. I know I would be a good parent but, I'm not really attracted to girls and I'm very confused. There are several things I wanting to get into and I'm actually making the effort to do them but, the depression is still there and I am afraid what will happen to me if I don't pull out of this. Has anybody in this situation been able to get out of it? Am I going about this the right way? I'd appreciate any advice you may have.nnThanks,nDirk"
6vh36d," Looking for advice. I'm 15 yearold boy, and I'm in a basketball team. Apparently, I don't like being in the team. I just lost interest(in almost everything) and I'm feeling anxious before every ball practice for some reason. So the thing is I don't want to be in the team anymore and I was gonna tell my coach about quitting the team, I have no idea what to say to my coach. I was anxious the whole day about this and is still hesitating what to say, so I came here for some advice. (Was gonna tell him by texting cuz it's the only way for now) I don't know why this bugs me out so much. Should I just tell him the truth or make up a better excuse? I'm scared of how the coach will react if I just tell him I lost interest and want to quit. What should I say? "
lave7m,"What do I do?. I'm turning 14 and my social anxiety has been badly affecting my school life. Every morning, I would always be nervous to go to school and get a bad stomachache or/and diarrhea from it. During physical education classes, I would get extremely anxious as we would be playing in teams. I am very uncomfortable with playing with most of my classmates because I feel like they would think I'm pathetic or useless since I am both physically weak and bad at sports. I always try to sit out but I would also feel like a huge burden to my team. I hate that feeling. Because of that, I am not able to focus in class and worry a lot if I had physical education that day. I can't travel by public transportation or go outside by myself. I get very self-conscious when I'm outside and want to just crawl in a hole of shame. This is a problem as in the future, I must be able to travel by public transportation to go to college or work. (I walk to school btw.) A few of my friends and teachers know I have this issue but I feel like I'm bothering them too much and it might be annoying to them since I keep avoiding social situations and panic a lot. I feel like this social anxiety problem might make it seem like I just want attention and I feel like some of them might come to dislike me. This has been going on for a few years and it has started to become worse: my grades are starting to drop and I can't sleep when I'm worrying about interactions I done in the past every night. At this rate, I might not be able to keep up with my studies. Moreover, my country's education system is very stressful and has a deep emphasis on grades and tests. I don't know who to talk to: my parents and siblings don't understand stand and they think that I'm just making excuses, I don't want to keep depending on my friends as well as teachers. I'm also afraid to get professional help as I don't want to bother my parents and I'm afraid of talking to someone I don't know. I seriously don't know what to do. I had enough of social anxiety. I just wish I was born like any other ordinary person and have ordinary problems. How can I be able to cope with my everyday life? (Sorry if I wrote too much, I just needed to let it all out after years of keeping it to myself.)"

3ntbwp," Things that have helped me a lot. Hello all, 25 (m, usa) with acute social anxiety and bipolar depression here. I just wanted to post something uplifting and encouraging, especially for people in high school and college. I don't mean to pressure anyone into doing anything that helped me, and I don't mean to prescribe advice, but I hope you find this helpful and thought provoking! It's hard, but we can do it. We can make friends, we can talk to people. Some things that helped me: -Learning that online community is, or can be, real community. Whether it's gaming (shouts out r/gfd) or Fb, or reddit, you can live your life online, that's okay. It's not a great solution for everyone, and honestly can make anxiety worse if a troll comes around, or if you want to move away from your online ""shell"". But really, don't beat yourself up if you're more comfortable online than in person, that is totally fine, and you can build from that! In high school I had more friends on death metal forums than in school for years, but that changed after I got into sports, which leads me to -Join a sports group. Not a club or gym, mind you (not that staying fit in general wouldn't help) but something like yoga (which is excellent in and of itself for helping cope with anxiety, shouts out r/yoga), or basketball, or paintball or anything. And if you can't find something you're interested in, start something! I know that sounds scarry as hell, but so does being alone. Use your loneliness as a motivator, in as much as you can. -Volunteer for a cause or issue you care about. I got really into the homelessness issue in the city I attended University in. I ended up starting a homeless outreach initiative, and leading it for years. It was terrifying. Honestly, I would make excuses to leave me own organizations activities early so I could go hyperventilate, and I often believed everyone disliked me or thought I was fake or something. But the cause kept me going. I had a fond kinship with a lot of the people struggling with homelessness in my city, because I had a community of people just as in need of authentic human interaction as I was. Plus it helped that many of the people on the street had similar mental health issues as me. But check out your local animal shelter, or hospice care, or old folks home, or even political campaigns. It'll help you meet people, and more importantly it will help teach you how to function around people while doing something you can be proud of, no matter how you feel in a given moment (which is hugely important for people like me who have difficulty with self worth and emotional swings) -Take acting, speech, improv, or stand up classes. This is a nightmare. I won't sugar coat it. I have taken about a dozen of these sorts of classes over the last decade. In Each one - without fail- for the first few weeks, I would show up late or ditch early (if I came at all) and I would almost always puke or violently cry alone at home after these classes... But I kept going, somehow, for some reason. And it really helped. I learned how to speak in front of people without much fear (best advice I ever got from a speech prof was, ""just remember, it's not a big deal. Anytime you feel nervous, just remind yourself, it's okay, it's not a big deal.""), I learned how to tell stories that would make people think and laugh. Honestly, I just learned how to be myself without freezing with fear or uncertainty. And I met really supportive people. After a few weeks in each comedy or improv class I've done, people go out to get drinks or add each other on fb or whatever, and I always reached out to at least one or two people I thought I could trust to not gossip about me and I would tell them I'm only in the class to help me with my social anxiety, and to try and meet people. I have only ever been met with overwhelming support and encouragement. I want to emphasize this point for us nerds, geeks, and wierdos. The amateur comedy world is often full of narcissistic talkers, but you find really good genuine people here too. -Being gentle with myself and others. I see a lot of self blame, and self hate on this and other related subs. I get it, I've been there. But it never got me anywhere but further into depression and away from community. It's not some th you can easily control, I know, but it's something to work on. For me, I had to be comfortable with the body I was in, and not constantly disparage myself for my weight or features (shouts out r/bodypositivity). I also had to learn to be very patient and understanding to others. It's easy to become upset when you feel you are being ignored or rejected, but listen, social anxiety isn't easy. It's hard. And the things that helped me and continue to help me are hard, and one of the hardest things to do is let go of rejection and learn to embrace and accept yourself, without spreading negativity to people you feel wronged you. Of course, I had to do this carefully, if I felt someone was actually negligent towards me or my feelings I would gently remove them from places of importance in my life. But hanging on to their negligence doesn't help me... All in all I want to say this (tl;dr) be proactive in your mental health. Be positive with your mind, emotions, and body. Give yourself a break in life, but also challenge yourself to do new and terrifying things. I know we can't always show up, be present, speak at all, or even look someone in the eyes. And that's okay. Your journey is your own, so take everything I said with a grain of salt, and please, add some other insight into what has helped you, and what continues to help you, in the struggle for your own self determination, and self acceptance. "
3wf3bk," My bf's friends don't like me because of my SA. So me(22F) and my boyfriend (25M) have been dating for almost a year now. I first met his friends 5 months into our relationship. (most of his friends are engaged so he doesn't see them all the time plus we live in different cities so our schedules didn't always line up for me to meet them earlier) We all went out to a movie, and then dinner for his friend’s birthday. I was so incredibly nervous, but also excited to learn more about my boyfriend by meeting his friends. On the whole, I felt good about the night. I was pretty quiet throughout, but I could joke and comment here and there. Mostly I was sitting back and trying to get the vibe of his friends. I felt a bit weird that no one asked me any questions, or tried to talk to me, but I figured maybe they were as nervous as I was, seeing as we're all kind of on the nerdy side. I wished I had talked more and gotten to know everyone better, but I was optimistic and told myself it wasn't that bad, and that I'd do better next time. Fast forward another 5 months, and I was invited to go to his best friend’s engagement party. I was a lot more nervous this time around. It had been a very long time since I last met them, and I do very badly in a party setting. Before the party, I was asking him information on his friends, so I could think of something to talk to them about. As it was time to leave, I began to feel incredibly sick from nervousness. I felt like I was going to puke and I was bent over the toilet. My boyfriend waited up for me and gave me a moment to relax. He told me if I was feeling unwell, I could stay back. I was so tempted, but I realized how important it was to meet his friends, and how rude it would come off if I canceled at the last minute. So we were in the car on the way to the party, and I started to tell him please don’t leave me alone at the party. (I should also note, I’ve never mentioned to my boyfriend I have social anxiety, because I’ve always been a bit in denial about it) He said that he’d stay with me, but at some point he’d want to break off and enjoy the party. I started to panic, and I told him not to leave me. He thought it was funny, and started to joke that the second he walked through the door he was going to ditch me. I started to get really upset, and he said everything was going to be fine, and that I’d do great. We walked through the door and were greeted by a bunch of people I didn’t know. Most of his friends hadn’t arrived yet, so the two of us just talked for a bit. Once his friends had arrived, my bf flocked to them immediately and they started joking and telling inside jokes straight away. I didn’t even have a chance to say hi. For the next hour I stayed with my bf, contributing absolutely nothing to their boisterous conversation. I felt so awkward, and like I was a wet blanket. It occurred to me to go talk to the bride to be, who I met briefly last time, but she was surrounded by a tight group of her giggling college buddies, and when I went over, I didn’t know any of the people they were gossiping about. I stuck to my boyfriend, and his friend said everyone was taking pictures in the basement. I told him to go ahead, that I’d meet up with him later. Everyone disappeared downstairs, and I awkwardly watched alone from the sideline. For the next couple of hours, my boyfriend started to have more fun without me. He kept checking up on me, and would hang out with me, but I noticed he wasn’t interacting with anyone when he was with me, and not having fun, so I kept leaving him so he could hang out with his friends. It started to feel so painfully awkward being alone with no one to talk to for hours on end, so I glued myself to my phone and texted friends. I was fighting back tears and feeling so painfully like a loser. It was then that my bf checked up on me. He said “Hey how are you doing? Are you going to sit here in a corner by yourself and text all night, or are you going to get up and try talking to someone?” For the first time ever I heard a hint of anger and frustration in his voice, and all the emotions just came out and I started to cry. He became immediately concerned, and whisked me away outside. We sat in his car, and we talked. I told him I didn’t feel comfortable at parties, and he said he was an introvert, and he didn’t like them either, but he could turn it on when he wanted to. I told him that I couldn’t just turn it on when I wanted to, and that I was never going to be the fun girl at a party for him. I expressed how I felt like a loser, and how I must have come off so rude to everyone. He was very soothing and held me, and told me how much he loved me. He said, so what if you didn’t make the best impression they’ll be other chances. He asked me what I wanted to do, and at that point my face was smeared with black from my running makeup, and I just wanted to go home. He drove me, and we went to bed, and he just held me and said soothing things to calm me down. As I was about to fall asleep, he told me he was going to go back to the party. It upset me, but I let him because I also realized how I ruined his night. It’s been 2 months since that incident, and in that time we had a brief breakup for about two weeks. (he broke up with me because he felt like he wasn’t ready to be in a relationship, but wanted to get back together when he said he realized in that time how much I meant to him) Last night he invited me to see a movie with him and his friends in a week. I declined initially, but he was really disappointed, so I said I’d find a way to come. I’m so nervous. I feel as though his friends must hate me, after I “ignored” everyone at the party, and left early without saying goodbye. I realize now how little I know about any of them after being with my bf for a year. And now, I don’t know what any of them must think of me after our breakup. I want to make a real effort for them to like me, but I feel as though they must have a horrible opinion of me. At worst, they think I’m a stuck up bitch. At best, I’m an incredibly weird and awkward loner. Sorry for the novella, but my main question is, has anyone had any experiences like this? Is it possible to redeem yourself from a bad impression? And most importantly, how the hell do you talk and socialize when you’d rather be drowning in a lake? "
qfch4o," Why so many posts on here asking ""How to get friends"" or ""I want friends""? I've always had an independent attitude. maybe its from me bullying experiences in school or walking through the hallways knowing nobody in this sea of kids.. Im 14 (not that that matters, I just type that so you get to know me better lol) Anyways, I've always had an independent attitude. maybe its from my bullying experiences in school or walking through the hallways knowing absolutely nobody surrounded in this sea of kids. I've grew kind of a low key hatred, or distaste for other people. "
gqt445,"What's wrong with me ?. Hey guys So I have a few problems in my life and I don't know how to get over these things. 1.. I don't know how to Express my feelings. 2. I can't tell my Mom that I love her and that I'm thankful for all the things she's done for me. 3. I hate the fact that I always have to act different when going to a family dinner or similar events. 4. I can't speak up for myself. If there is anything that's bothering me I'll always keep it to myself. ( scared of hurting other feelings ) 5. I'm scared to talk to my boss at work. He's a really cool dude but still I don't know how to talk to him. 6. I always put other people over me. Everyone is always more important then me. 7. I don't want to buy things for myself. I bought my GF a iPhone and a Mac but when she bought me Tekken 7 and a headset I went to the shop to bring it back because it's to expensive. 8. I dont know what my passion is. I love doing a lot of things and my interest spreads on everything but I never really stick to something 9. I can't really talk to some people like my mom, strangers, my mother-in-law. My girlfriend always forces me to speak but I actually don't know how to.. This is one of my major problems that I have to change. When me and my GF are at my mom's house she's talking more then me and I don't think this is normal. My mom is definitely the best mom on earth but I actually never told her anything similar like this.. She deserves much more love from my side. 10. I can't talk with my girlfriend when we're fighting about things. My mind just turns off everything and turns on the ""noword"" mode. In these moments I just wanna give up on everything and die EVEN if it's a small fight about some stupid bullshit but everytime we fight it hurts me so much. 11. I don't really feel like going outside to my friends because I started to see the bad side of them and I'm happier sitting at home and playing computer with my younger brother. 12. I really don't have a problem with sitting at home doing nothing but my GF wants me to go outside and be social. I don't know how I got a girlfriend but I'm really happy with her. The problem is I really want to make her happy but I need to fix some things in my life.. I smoke weed and I think that's one of the factor of these problems. When I was a kid and did some dumb shit my mom tried to speak with me but I never said something I think this behaviour lead to the things I do nowadays. Hope you guys can give me some advice or recommend me a good book to help myself. If I could name the problem by myself It would be easier to get things done but the problem is I don't know what the problem is. Am I depressed, anxious or just introverted? idk... I'm 22 btw and I'm sorry for my english grammar."
6dvukh,"Update on my first ever solo-trip. (London; let me know if you wanna meet tomorrow!). The background is that I've been having problems with social anxiety for years. Always been shy, but at 12-13 it gradually shifted to social phobia and I entered therapy when I was 20. Travelling somewhere either solo or with someone has been my wish for more than 5 years. So now, finally, at the brink of turning 24, entering to a period of lifechange (graduation), I decided to do it. My destination is London. Living in the EU it's hassle free to get there and I wont have to risk language barrier issues. Not to mention it's a popular tourist area which should also make my stay quite fluid. And as of writing this, I have only one day left to spend here. So far I've been doing so good. I can recommend this place as a 'starter' for anyone here struggling with anxiety due to perhaps 'not having what it takes' to travel alone. For me overall, it has been a very positive experience. I'm sad it will be over soon. And that I can't do it more often. *Summary of positive changes so far* * Not getting adrenaline rushes when having to approach ticket sales, security checks, cashiers OR when someone approaches me and asks something. * Didn't cancel any planned activity due to anxiety (only didnt take part of one event, part anxiety but mostly due to 2 other reasons) * No anxiety walking in crowded areas (and since i'm from a small city I hadnt really 'seen' what a real crowded street means. * No anxiety taking photos or filming while on streets. Even selfies (i could never take selfies before) * Satisfaction and risen sense of self-worth *Stuff that i was unsuccessful with* * Approaching random people with random requests (directions, something silly, compliments etc). Only appoached one guy, offered to watch his stuff so he could getbetter clothing because he seemed cold. He denied, if you're reading this say hi! * shopping for clothes. I get anxiety in department stores andclothes shops, especially when approached and offered help. Although i managed to visit and browse around, i was anxious, avoided eye contact with anyone and never tried anything and ended up not buying anything even though i would have wanted to. * eating out. That's kinda 50-50. I'm still afraid to even enter cafes or restaurants, let alone eat. I did however manage to eat at burger king and 3 other instant-food places. But since i failed to even enter most places, i consider it a failure. **On other note**: i do have one day left, so if anyone would like to meet up with a fellow SAD sufferer, let me know. I'm planning to visit primrose hill if the weather allows. Guys or girls, doesn't matter. I'm 23/M"
nujjmf," Interacting with other people is hard from nature itself. just because you are not happy with your confidence, does not mean you have social anxiety disorder. Interacting with other people is just hard from nature itself. That is also why the few people who are very good at it get so much respect, women, better jobs. Just walk on the streets and you will notice stiffness in other people. "
f5t7xo3,"It's a day-to-day thing for me. I just started a new job and am anxious because I don't know my routine yet, my tasks, etc. I want to quit but I need the money and the life experience. So I'm just gonna go in tonight, find one of my department members and learn the ropes.nnEvery day I'll be anxious, and then one day I'll look back and realize I know what I'm doing. Maybe you start small, go for a run on the treadmill, then start doing machines as you feel comfortable, then weights or whatever your goals are. Soon you won't even notice the men around you."
79z6m3,"Are people who suffer from social anxiety really just a collection of individuals who are too harsh on themselves?. I just realised this today and I am not sure it applies to everyone with social anxiety. However, I think that my severe social anxiety stems from being WAY too hard on myself. I just constantly scrutinise/ ridicule myself, find reasons why I am not good enough. From my looks to my personality etc. It can be an extremely negative thing in these circumstances, but also can be positive in some situations. I am a EXTREMELY harsh on myself when it comes to things like: gaming, the gym and any competitive settings and I think this has somewhat of a positive impact (on performance at least). For example, my gym has a competition on the rowing machine where you have to row 1000m in the fastest time possible. I tried this yesterday and placed second in my gym (5 seconds behind 1st place). A normal person would be happy with their performance and think that 2nd was good enough. However, I was distraught, extremely disappointed in myself. I don't even train rowing directly, I do a lot of weightlifting in the gym to strengthen my back, biceps, legs etc. which all help in rowing, but up until this point I had never even been on a rowing machine (subtle brag l000l). But I think that this irrational self-hatred and intense criticism is a cause, or at least one of the causes of social anxiety. We convince ourselves that we are not good enough, that we are somehow less worthy than others. This manifests itself and creates such a negative self image. Just an observation, does anyone else experience this?"
fjk7yrl," I am on the same level as you are, as the coronavirus is spreading I hope the government orders everyone to wear the masks so it can hide my mouth and cheeks which will not make people to see how the expression on my face is. Which can drastically reduce my social anxiety and I can go outside more wearing the masks "
dirqjac,"Go outside! Walking, getting fresh air, and sun will make you feel 100x better. I make it a point to spend a lot of time outside now and it helps immensely.nnIt's really not that dangerous, as the other commenters have said, but you should make it a habit to be aware of your surroundings, keep an eye on people, trust your instincts, etc, etc. You'll be fine."
7h18x0," Had jury duty, became unbearably anxious in the courtroom, told the judge and got dismissed.. I had my first ever experience with jury duty earlier this week. I'm 20. I was obviously anxious in the days leading up to it but I convinced myself that they wouldn't need me so I was able to stay pretty calm and hoped for the best. I got there, signed in, and sat with all the other people waiting. About 30 minutes passed and then my name got called in the first group. Fuck. I go down to the courtroom with a group of maybe 30 or 40 other potential jurors. Then I got called up in the first group of people to be questioned by the judge/lawyers. As I was sitting there in the chair, *that feeling* started to set in. I was in front of a big group of strangers about to be asked questions about myself. It all felt very important, like I couldn't make any mistakes. I was soooo far out of my comfort zone. My chest started to feel heavy, I started to shake a little bit. I tried doing some breathing exercises but that didn't help. Finally, after sitting up there for about five minutes, I just thought fuck it, raised my hand and said ""Your Honor, may I approach?"" (this is something I never, ever would have done if I wasn't feeling so horrible) He said okay so I walked up to the bench, the two lawyers joined, and said something like ""I have anxiety and I feel like I'm about to have an anxiety attack, I've been trying to keep it together but I can't do it and I just really need to get out of here."" At that point my voice was faltering and my eyes were welling up with tears. The judge asked if I was alright, I said yes and that I just needed some air, and he let me leave. As I walked out, I was shaking with every breath. I sat in my car for a while after and cried. I felt so horribly anxious and so embarrassed that I walked out crying in front of all those people. Now I don't know what to do when I get summoned again in the future. Anyway, thanks for reading. I wanted to get this off my chest and I'm also trying to practice posting stuff on reddit. Anyone have a similar experience? Any advice for next time? TL;DR: see title. "
ltn9w4,"I messed up so bad today and can’t stop thinking about it. So I look after this girls dog (6 months old) on Saturdays, I had asked her if I could use the extendable lead I have rather than the regular one she has and she said that would be great. Today we were walking and came across the girls sister and family. The dog recognised them and tried to run towards them and the lead snapped. We had to try and figure out how we’re gonna get the dog home and eventually it turned out they had something in their car they could use so I’m back home with the dog now. I remember them mentioning it’s good to carry another lead incase and it’s lucky they were there I can’t stop thinking about the whole situation I just want to cry I feel so awkward or irresponsible. How do I get over this situation and not play it over and over again in my head wondering if they seemed annoyed or think I’m not responsible. Please help"
den80pq," Well, I've already written this much, might as well push on. Part four: My opinions don't matter High school. Some people love it, others hate it. I.... Tolerated it. So picture me. 8th grade. Popular. Girls like me, just don't like any of them. Not necessarily because of trust at this point, it was a small school, not the best dating pool. I have friends. Well, it turns out I live in a different district than everyone else in my class. I will be attending high school with no one I know. Last time I switched schools, I was betrayed by every person who knew me. I had somewhat forgiven most of them, but the emotional damage was done. I tried to combine my parents to send me to the private school some of my classmates were attending, but they told me to write a letter asking for financial aid. I did. It was very heartfelt. I have it to my parents. They wouldn't send it, saying that if I went, they would have to pay to send the rest of my siblings there. They said you are going to the new school, and that's that. I also loved basketball. I was one of the best players in my school. But being a short white kid in an inner city high school wasn't exactly basketball material. My coaches told me I should try out. They said I was better than some of the other kids who played at our school that went on to play for big high schools. But my parents shamed me out of it. They said, play a different sport, when that you will make the team and be good. They made me join the golf team. I like golf, but not as a sport. Then my parents enrolled me in all the advanced magnet programs that I didn't want to do. Again, I don't get a say. So I start school. I was a quiet, shy kid in a a large high school. I found out later that most of the kids in my classes thought I was funny, and that some of the girls liked me and tried to flirt with me and text me, but I was terrified of being ostracized like last time. So I'd did nothing, made no real friends, only acquaintances for during class. I did nothing but go to school, come home and sleep. After a year of misery, I told me mom I was depressed. She dismissed me and when I asked her about it years later, she denied this ever happened. So I just kept going, telling myself what I always did. Just keep going, it will get better. "
fem110m," Gym isn’t for me either. I choose to exercise outside. Bike,ski, roller skate, walk 😊 "
eogc0b,"Facial Scar Causes my Social Anxiety. I am a 24 year old woman. I was quite outgoing and loud until the age of 14. I was on holiday in Greece and ended up hitting my head by the pool. I had to get 22 stitches in the middle of my forehead and they didn't remove them for almost a week. As a result, I was left with an indented scar in my forehead. It made me very insecure and depressed. It just looks like a line or a permanent wrinkle on my forehead. I cover it with medical tape or sillicone makeup to ""fill it in"" when I have time in the morning. I was also verbally abused by my mother who called me ugly, retard, scar-face, failure, worthless piece of sh1t, and told me I would never get into college. I think my facial scar and horrible mother caused me to become increasingly more insecure, quiet, and socially anxious. The sad part is that I've lived with this scar for 10 years now and STILL can't get over it. It can honestly ruin my entire day if I catch a glance at it in bad or harsh lighting during the day. People act like I am being overdramatic or vain when I complain about it (or they say it's ""just a scar""), but honestly I do not think a person can understand how difficult it is to live with a facial scar until they have one themselves..."
isi603,"Childhood. Anyone feels like their childhood/teenage years were horrible? I know my life sucked big time but I was wondering if anyone here had similar experiences with a toxic parent. I just wanted to vent as almost none knows about my life truly. I was an extrovert as a child. My mother however was hating me for being weird. I was talking everything I was thinking. I was unusual because I talked to grass and other weird stuff. I had good perspective even as a public speaker. I was never shy. I had quite bad ADHD and was always in trouble which made my kindergarten teacher say I should receive better education. My brother was born with severe Down Syndrome and he needed help with everything. Eventually my mom became mentally ill. However even before, my mom tried to control me and shut me down and eventually when I was bad in school or I disagreed with her (I was always speaking my mind and I wasn't into school as a kid). She started beating me eventually. She was so furious with me. She didn't like me as a kid. Apparently there are lots of parents who expect their kid to be perfect. She told me many times that I shouldn't have been born. She limited my carrier dreams to stupid random stuff because I was average to bad in middle school. My dad was supporting me but he got ill with MS and he started to have mental and physical problems too. Luckily his disease didn't progress much. But he beat my mom and was hating her I guess for having a disabled kid but also other reasons. We were isolated mostly from family friends and family in general. We became poor and couldn't afford many basics although I always had food on the table. I'm from a second world country so not much help from the government was possible. I was mostly at school and at my grandparents in the summer. I rarely interacted with kids my age. I met my bestfriend when I was 8. She also had a disabled sister and she understood what I was going through. She's in another country now and me too. I still talk to her a lot, but she's far away. Without her in my life I would have killed my self long time ago. I have a boyfriend that I live with that understands me but it's still difficult when he's actually an extrovert. My anxiety got 1000 times worse here in Netherlands. I know it's my social anxiety too, but this country also isn't happy with strangers. I work in a fast food restaurant and I hate being watched by costumers all day. This kind of job drives me insane. I study so luckily I will be able to find a nice desk job in a few years. Until then my life seems a nightmare. I speak sometimes to a few people but I don't really have friends here. I don't have with anyone to go out just weekly or something. I wish I could talk easily to people. In my country at least people were nice to me. They understood more mental illnesses, traumas, being an introvert or just shy. Here everyone treats me like a weirdo. I guess I'll move countries and jobs all the time. Maybe a desk job will be cool someday."
f6h02xn, I can relate to that. Both my parents are like that. I avoid my parents even though I live with them because of this sorta thing. It's miserable to feel like you're being judged not only outside but at your own home 
f7hgstc,Dude my anxiety stems from one specific incident when I was a kid too. I think I was 6. My mom told me to watch my brother when we were outside and I got distracted playing with my friend. My mom came outside screaming at me that my brother could’ve died because my brother was wandering around in the street (he was 2) and ever since then it’s like I snapped. I followed him EVERYWHERE even inside the house and I was paranoid that the doors and stuff weren’t locked. I checked constantly. I would have severe panic attacks if he left my sight and I’d cry/break down. I’m afraid of having kids because I think the cycle will start again.
rgi3eh," First ever date question. I asked a girl out online and she accepted, the anticipation anxiety is worse than ever before. She’s also an introvert and we have a lot in common so I’m feeling a mountain of pressure not to blow it. What’s something that helps you calm down when meeting for the first time? Deep breathing helps but it’s not enough for me in this situation, it’s really hard to focus externally with all the anxiety symptoms. We’d be walking outside so at least it isn’t as tense as a restaurant "
ej2ojeu,"Hey, you're not worthless. Think about some nice things you've done for your friends and family, surely there are thoughtfull things you've done? Try writing down 10 positive things about yourself to stop this negative rumination for a moment. There is still so much growth you can do in the coming years. Your 20's will be a very transforming time. At this moment try making some small steps. A first thing you could do while walking down the street or in a park, is nodding to passersby, people walking their dog or something. That is a very easy first step. Next you could say thank you to cashiers or other service people in a more elaborate way then you do now. Other things that could help your social skills are therapy and improv classes. If you're at university you could probably get some cheap therapy sessions. These could give you a very safe place to develop your skills. The therapist would fuction as your coach on this journey of self-improvement. Try not setting your goals to 'losing my virginity' or 'get a girlfriend'. You'll help your self-esteem if you set goals that are fully within your control like: 'I said hello to 3 people in class today'. This way situations that didn't evolve like you wished, won't drag you down as much."
cys4rzy," There is one cure that's going to be incredibly hard for you, but take every opportunity you can muster to do it: Get out of your room, go outside and stuff. Really, the only thing that works against the point you're at is to desensitize yourself to the things you're afraid of. I think there's a subconscious thing going on when we've spent too much time by ourselves that makes it feel like we're seeing demons and monsters. Mental clarity is key and physical activity gives you the energy you lack right now. Trust me. As soon as you feel ready, step outside and do something, like take a long walk: Find a destination, go there and back again. "
57gsvd," I'm feeling like I don't have interests or a personality. I thought I had interests in certain activities (for example horse riding, or baking) but when I did the activity, I wasn't enthusiast. I'm not a person with so many interests, but the interests I have, after a while I'm not enjoying them anymore. For example, 2 months ago I started horse riding because I thought it would be good for my social anxiety. But I realized that I was doing the activity only because with it I could overcome my anxiety a bit, but I wasn't enjoying it! It's like I'm doing something only for my anxiety, if I do something I can say ""wow, I'm not isolating myself, I'm with people, I'm learning something, I'm like everyone else!"" but I'm not really interested in them after a while. I do things for my anxiety, because I have to expose myself, but not for myself, not because I am passionate. In general recently I find it hard to define who I am, without ""adding"" my anxiety. Its like the traits I have, are there because I have SA, or depression. Without SA I wouldn't have these traits. When I have to describe myself, I only think about the traits that are related to anxiety. I'm so confused :\ "
p8xr7z," Don't think, act.. Here i was in a complete analysis paralysis asking myself if i should go outside or not. I got fed up with so much thinking and just fucking went outside. Put a leash on my dog and had a little walk with him on the neighborhood. It's not much, but it felt good, and it makes me want to do this more often. I know sometimes it's hard to ""just do it"" because of fear, but if you ever have the courage to act, don't waste your time, do it. "
euh1bc5, I got back from a summer camp recently that involves staying in a dorm and went to the bathroom and cried at the fact that I had it all to myself and then cried over having my own room College is going to be interesting to say the least. I was to afraid to shower the whole week 
dgky0y6," I started on a negative mindset as well. I told my friend to ""negatively encourage"" me. Instead of sugarcoating my weaknesses, I had to face them. Not to mention that progress takes time and effort, so patience and consistency is key (consistently trying very hard to aim for results in the long run). Progress will come, you can want it badly and stare in the mirror everyday, but you won't see it until some time passes, and you get fully surprised. Don't ever wait for that moment, thinking it will come when you slack off, because it won't. Maybe this will help. When people positively encouraged me, it didn't matter. I had to push myself, using my own mental focus to get in the right mindset. I had to try, and finish better than my previous best. I had no one to hold accountable for, except myself. It didn't matter if they were stronger, or everyone had finished before me, I had to see improvement, because that beats false self-satisfaction for achieving the same record repetitively. I used to be the worst runner in the school running team, I consistently finished last but I was still improving, shaving off seconds each week. Unfortunately I had breathing problems and had to quit running, so I went to weights. By the way I walked in the gym today with new shoes for my squats and was afraid of people judging me for my shoes throughout my whole workout. It never goes away... For social anxiety: your peers will most likely see you as a person, not defining your social standing by your fitness. You're allowed to fidget, because even if you tried not to you would, so just accept the fact that you're anxious and don't be afraid of the extra microexpressions and jittering, because that makes you more anxious. You can be as nervous as you want or become nervous anyway from trying too hard to keep your cool, the former is better. "
ewsok5d," I'm already there. I approached people at park benches for example and under those circumstances, at least where I live, people are initially defensive. But once you start talking to them and opening them up. Through my many approahces, I've basically lost the fear of talking to people. "
cpg1hf," Hello there .. I went out there started talking and it’s working. So, here is my story.. I’m 25 and super anxious ... and I started using reddit recently ... I was reading a lot of posts to boost my confidence and I realized it’s not just me actually there are lot of people who are in the same boat ... AND AND I was just reading and doing nothing ... So, while I was going through some post ... one of them pointed out that it’s worthless if you are just reading and not making any progress ... GOD this hit me so bad... So the next second I just started talking to people about random things ... like literally the first thing I can think of.. Trust me guys ... it worked like a charm ... I was interacting with one of my customer in workplace for more than 20 minutes (it’s a milestone for me) ..who is a complete stranger ... and most of the customers asked my name and introduced themselves and left the store ... I never felt happy like this before ... Yes yes ... it was little awkward and nervous on the day 1... but on day3 it went down so smooth .. Guys trust me ..it’s just the initiative you have to take.. it is similar to the 1st day of learning the bicycle ...it’s scary and you are afraid of getting hurt ... but eventually you don’t even care if you get hurt ... you just fucking step up and continue riding it...which means I had some bad interactions too ..but I didn’t let me down.. I started off with customers and now I’m getting smooth with the people around my workplace and today GUYS please BELIEVE me , I sat next to the pretty girl in my class and talked to her with ease and didn’t get anxious at all ..not even for a second ... Thanks a lot reddit ... and anyone out here ... still afraid of taking the initiative ..just hit me a message... i will do my best to help you out. "
f28n9o,"Paranoid feelings? Is this social anxiety? What can I do?. My social anxiety is severe. I can’t leave the house anymore because of it. I am constantly am afraid of losing control in front of a person, doing something embarrassing, they will notice me stress and panic behavior and lose the ability to communicate. It effects my life a lot next to my GAD. I’m not speaking of months, but for around 3 years my anxiety went worse till next year where I struggled a lot to even take a walk. I wonder if social anxiety can really be this severe? I even start to feel uncomfortable around my own family. I can’t even open the door anymore for someone. When I am alone at home I feel paranoid that someone will ring the bell. It really destroy(ed) my life. I’m super ashamed of myself and feel like a lost cause. I want to go outside, but also don’t. I’m basically 24/7 busy with this. I am trying exposure... Sometimes. I only got negative experience which makes me feel kinda unmotivated as well. I’m 20yo and I don’t live at myself and have almost no responsibility anymore. I’m wondering why I am having to go through to this, because everything seems pointless. My GAD increases my social anxiety. I also struggle with scary and unpleasant thoughts all the time. It makes me feel I’ll go crazy which is like one of my biggest fears. I’m currently waiting for professional help, but honestly don’t know how I can pull that off. I hope someone will reply to me. It would be much appreciated. Thank you."
q57tye," Do I complain too much? What's wrong with me? Be honest pls.. This is my first time posting on reddit. I'm 22 male. I wrote sth before it's not up to date. My english isn't really good. It's not in proper order. Sry if I sound cringe. One more thing I always use introverted but social anxiety suits me better. What do you guys think? I'm I just lazy? What's wrong with me? Do I complain too much? Hey *****, My name is ***** and I'm 21. I'm a Sri Lankan to be specific a Tamil born in Germany. Both my parents are Tamil. I want some advice from you guys. It's about my personal struggles. Would be nice if you can help me out. Let's start with my childhood. My dad has an alcohol problem and my mom has schizophrenia. So the childhood of me and my 2 siblings wasn't really good. A lot of altercations, swearing and problems. My parents aren't educated and they can't speak german as well. My dad works as an dishwasher and my mom is retired earlier because of her schizophrenia. My relationship to my dad is not good but I don't really care. I don't like him and I don't speak to him. When we speak I'm mostly swearing. I already got physical in the past but I can control myself most of the time. My older sis basically took care of all of us. She took all the stress on her shoulders. She is 23 and finished her bachelor in industrial engineering, now she's doin' her master. My lil bro is 17 and is attending 11th grade. I failed the last half year of 13th grade because of my oral marks. I'm introverted. I don't like this word. I would rather call me inexperienced. My siblings are way more extroverted than me. December 2018 was my last month in school. After that I worked in a textile factory for around 6 months. Now I'm doin' federal voluntary service at a workshop for disabled workers. I started august 2019. It will take 1 year. It's the only and fastest way to get to uni for me. I don't like social work but I keep goin'. Why did I became introverted? I became introverted because of my parents tradition and strict rules, I would say. Smoking, alcohol, drugs, partying and having a gf/bf is a no go. I can't have a gf. All Tamils in my district would start talking bad about my family. It's like a bush fire everybody would know in seconds. It would kill my family's honour. I don't want a gf anyway until I solved all my problems. For an Tamil is it normal to live with their parents until finishing Uni and getting married. Marrying a person with a different nationality is also a no go. How was your time in school? It was alright. I was the quiet, shy and introverted one in my class. I have 2 good friends that I know since first grade. We still in contact but we don't really do much. I never got bullied or anything like that. Most of my time after school I was at home playing on my phone or rarely on my pc. I only have a ps2 with 1 game no memory card and a nintendo. -.- I don't really grew up with gaming like other kids. My childhood was super boring. I wasted so much time staying home and doin' nothing. How does your typical day currently look like? I am at work from 07:30-16:00. After that I eat, take a nap, eat and then I watch YT all day long and your streams on ******* and *******. That's it. I can't go to the gym because of corona. What are your biggest problems? I'm so inexperienced in everything. I can't hold a convo because I have nothing to talk about. I'm shy. I'm not confident. I'm bad at socializing. I'm talentless. I never posted or sent a pic of me. I don't even have photos of myself on my phone. I don't use profile pics. I'm just a fking weird ass kid and I hate it so much. I missed so much fun in my youth. I feel like I wasted my whole life. I want to start from 0 again. I really wanna come out of my shell but I just can't. It's so hard for me. My life is like this for years now. I can't get fking rid of this. It's in my stupid head. Sometimes I just wanna sleep and never wake up again. Sometimes I say to myself I don't wanna get older than 30 and that I don't wanna date, marry someone. I don't want kids either. I think I would be bad father. First of all I just want to be 100% happy with myself, then the rest can come but it seems like I will never be happy.I'm scared that I will drop out of uni. I hate presentations and learning for hours I can't do that. I'm only one in my clique who wants to study. I'm so bad at connecting to other people :/ Even when I finish it, no one want a introvert in his company. It's kind of my parents fault that I became like this. All their tradition and rules messed everything up. I can't blame it all on them. I could have changed everything but I felt helpless. Here are some questions that I think of a lot. Those questions are really bothering me. Will I finally accept myself? Can I make the people around me proud? Will I be happy at some point ? Will I found my love ? Is it worth to keep goin'? If I'm being honest. I don't wanna live at all costs. I'm just keeping my remains up. I feel like I'm in cage with no liberties. Why can't I just have a normal life like a white kid in Germany ? My parents just making it harder for me but in the end of the day change need to come from my side. Being an introvert is so fkd up. I can't progress. I always stand in my way. I don't chose it. It just happened and I can't get rid of it. I only have 2 goals that I wanna achieve. Finishing uni and buying my mom a house in Canada. We have a lot of relatives there. Is one of her dreams. I feel much better writing all this. Feels like I'm in a therapy. I really enjoy watching your YT videos and streams. It helps me to forget about my problems. Anyway love you guys keep up the good work. Some things changed. I finished my federal voluntary service. Now I'm in uni studying Automation/Mechatronics i like it but it's too hard. I'm panicking I dont have a learn group or friends at uni. I don't even joined the discord of my major. I never wrote sth in the whatsApp group. I'm going to quit in the first semester. I have big problems with java and computer science. I can't sit for hours and learn. I just can't I feel like loser and pretty sure that I also have social anxiety. I don't enjoy life at all. There's no future for me when I quit uni. Am I overreacting, crying like a little kid or just lazy? What's wrong with me. I want to be successful in life. Right now I'm just a failure. I'm losing interest in life. I'm a burden for my parents and siblings. I'm not useful at all. My parents and siblings don't really need me at all. If I'm being honest I don't know what I want. I've lost all motivation in life. I don't care 'bout anything anymore. I'm so tired of living life. There's no reason to live for me. If I being honest becoming a father and having kids that's not me. I don't see that. I'm pretty much scared of life. I don't even know what I want. For your imagination: I'm a dark-skinned dude and 163cm(5'4) ""tall"" -.- I weigh around 70KG. I really like fitness in general and hearing music while sitting in the train looking out of the window is really relaxing for me. Sry for my english. I had a recruitment test and a job interview today for a apprenticeship as an mechatronic technician. The company want to give me the job. It will take 3.5 years but I really wanna stay in uni. Idk what to do. The chance that I dropout of uni is too high. Uni takes also 3.5 years but I can't make it in time. I have to take less exams this would stretch it to 4-5years probably. If I don't take the job I'm probably gonna regret it. In middle school 5th grade the first day we made a circle and everyone said what they want to become when they get older. They said things like singer, dancer, rapper, racing driver...I was the only one saying engineer. At that time I don't even knew what that is. It's like I want to make this happen at least. Should I keep going even though I probably gonna fail? I have so many thoughts in my head. It's messing me up. I talked with a friend, my family and decided to reject the job. It's a long time ago I talked with my friend. It feels like he's kinda turning into stranger. And that's basically my fault. I passed 4/5 exams somehow. Grades wasn't really good. Second semester is coming it will start at 14th of april. Right now: I feel so depressed. I get jealous very easily. When I see people having fun or being happy it makes me so sad. I never ordered food delivery before, i don't go out, didn't grew up with gaming, i didn't watch any series or movies. I was just at home doing nothing. Most of the time I can't relate to people and I hate it. Never had a mobile flat for my smartphone either. I hate celebrating things. I hate acting like I'm happy. I hate acting like I have a happy family. 3rd semester is going to be presence. I'm scared and I hate it. I'm just doing it cuz I have to. I don't like it at all. Still no friends in uni. I don't know what I wanna do in life. Dying sounds so nice. I don't have to worry about anything. Ultimate peace. "
4u08d7," First Reddit post rant about my life currenty. This is my first Reddit post because I just wanted to vent and rant somewhere and this is the first place that I've thought of. Anyways so I feel like I developed social anxiety in 7th grade because I don't want to sound stuck up or anything lol, but I would usually dress better than my friends and they would always find something to make fun of about my outfit, so I've downgraded my clothing in 11th grade to t shirts, basketball shorts, and vans. Then after that they would make fun of the shape of my head or how big my feet are, and eventually I became so self conscious about my appearance that I would just bottle up in class and say almost nothing. People tell me all the time that I'm tee ally quiet and that I look like someone that would be a talker and I wanna talk but whenever I talk to someone new,, I'm afraid I'm gonna stutter or that they're constantly judging my face or my body. I also have somewhat of an athletic build, I'm 15, 6'2, and about 240. Everyone wants me to play football but I honestly dont know anything about the sport I only watch it occasionally watch it. My social anxiety has ruined moderately ruined my social life because whenever someone saints something to me, I always get really nervous and either stutter or don't say anything at all and just nervously smile. Whenever I walk into a classroom I feel like everyone automatically is badly judging me and I just get anxious the entire time in my seat,, wanting to talk to people but to nervous of rejection or failure. Does anyone have any tips to get over this and if you've gotten completely over it, could you guide me? I get nervous to wear more high end stuff because I'm afraid that my friends will make fun of me.. It's also the last week of summer break and everytime I think of something fun to do I remember that school is around the corner and I just get sad "
fvam3wh," It would definitely help, Im big into snowboarding and I've always found being in my gear (googles/sunglasses, hat, maybe a neck gaiter) I feel much more at ease. But it also makes pretty obvious sense in my case, I have a huge fear of blushing, so covering my face puts me at ease. "
pev4wd,"Our stories are all different, yet they are all the same. A Long Explanation, but there's a point in here.. Originally, I had zero clue that I had SA. For context, I'm a 20 (almost 21) year old guy. For years, I had no idea I had it. I just thought I was weird, like I didn't fit in anywhere, like I didn't belong in this world. I never left the house unless I really had to. I still kind of just stay at home. Because of my father's work, we moved a lot both within the US and outside the US. For long periods of time, I had built friendships and relationships with people that would, ultimately, be torn down by moving again. And these days, I realize that this repeat of building and tearing down relationships based all on my father's work contributed heavily to me having SA. I never went anywhere to get diagnosed, but I began to learn about it when I was with my, now, ex-girlfriend. For those who are and will wonder, she approached me first. At one point, I talked to her about wanting to be more social, but I was going to do it online through a video game, first, that forces cooperation (a kind of game that I've wanted to try for the longest time at this point in time.) I went on, joined a team, and everything was fine for about 5 minutes. Then I got yelled at by someone on my team because I was still so new. I promptly quit and haven't touched it since. My ex sent me a clip that same day about social anxiety. I watched it, and I have never related to anything quite like it before. I started looking into it more and more, and then it clicked. Oh my God. This is me. The more I looked at it and the more I listened to first person accounts of SA, I was feeling devastated. I wondered what the hell I was gonna do. I didn't know if I needed to get medicated to relieve the symptoms, I didn't know if I needed to see a psychologist. I didn't know how I was going to handle it. What didn't help was that 2 months later, she broke up with me. That made things so much worse and left me depressed. I locked myself up at home for 8 months. All the while, the combination of depression and the feeling of not being able to talk to someone on my own without trembling and my throat going dry made me feel like I was weak and something was seriously wrong with me. It took me a long time, but I decided I had enough. I actively looked for how to deal with the anxiety through here on reddit and through Google searches. I found books, lectures, even Ted talks of success stories from social anxiety with methods on how to get past the many issues with it. At first, I thought that it was stupid and In wasting my time. But I kept reading and looking into things, trying each little method with little baby steps. Sure enough, it paid off. I got past my depression by finding activities that would capture my attention. I took to walking through the park everyday for at least 30 minutes. And I am now able to make new friends out in public just from talking to people, and I can even make phone calls without any problems from my anxiety. I've been with this community for only a few months, but I've seen so many different ways anxiety affects us and how we have all had different experiences that made it so strong in our lives. We all have our different experiences, but we all have very similar thoughts and feelings about things that make our lives incredibly difficult on a daily basis. In truth, my case is not as severe as others that have shared their lives, but SA isn't so much a disorder as it is a learned disability. Just as we learned it, we can also learn how to belittle it. It takes a lot of effort and work, but it can be done, and it is never too late to work on building yourself up. I hope you're all having a wonderful day, whatever you are! As cliche as it is, we're all in this together, and that's the truth. We all have the ability to help each other."
8s7h1k," I just went to a job fair for 8 hours, spoke to a lot of people, and got 3 offers.. (**TL;DR**: Went to a job fair for a hotel, had interviews for 3 different positions, spoke to many people, said a lot of ums, and got offers for all 3 positions.) So, today, I was scheduled to come in for 3 interviews for 3 different positions at a hotel for Kitchen Steward, Bus Person, and Busser/Runner. I signed in, got my name tag, and was put in a room with around 100 people or so. I sat near the front, so, if you looked behind you, you had a whole bunch of eyes peering at you. They had an extremely outgoing HR representative come and speak with us about what the company is about and telling us to stop being nervous because they wanted to hire all of us. That really helped. As soon as her speech was done, we were broken into groups by job position and had our group interviews. At the 1st group interview (Kitchen Steward), they asked us to tell us how our experience relates to this position, and asked two situational questions that were different for each person. If I remember correctly, I was asked “tell me about a time where you had to ask questions in order to help solve a situation with a dissatisfied customer” and “tell me a time where you had to do a task that was not a part of your job responsibilities.” I was definitely not prepared for those questions. I was extremely nervous. I stuttered and lost my train of thought multiple times. For the first question, I did ask them if I could get a minute to think about my answer and they asked everyone else questions before coming back to me. For the 2nd question, I had to think on my feet because they were running out of time, which made me look awkward because I still had to think about it while they were staring at me. But, I got through it. When we all answered the questions, they said they would decide who would move on to the one-on-one interview. As they left, I brought up the courage to ask another person (NP for Nervous Person) next to me how they think they did. He was extremely nervous and he stopped answering questions halfway through his answers because he was so nervous. One of the hiring managers had to bring him aside and tell him things to encourage him. He spoke English, but, by the way he was speaking, you would assume English was his second language. I didn’t want to say that he didn’t get a 2nd interview because I didn’t even think I was going to get one. When the hiring managers came back, they called our name one by one, even though there was only 4 of us, which I was confused by because NP said “If they call your name, it means that you didn’t get picked.” He knew this because he had an interview earlier. So, when they called one other person, whom I thought was decent, and another person, I thought “Wow, I wasn’t expecting that person to not get picked.” Then, when they said NP’s name, I’m thinking to myself “Am I the only one who’s getting an interview?” Then, they called my name. Now, I’m thinking “This doesn’t make any sense.” But, they told us we all passed to the one-on-one interviews. We were all excited, especially NP. We were put into another room with 40 or so people. NP was discussing his living situation and how he needed this job badly. I felt bad for him because I didn’t think he was going to pass and would be back at square one. I got called for my one-on-one interview. They asked me 3 questions: how does my experience relate to the job, why do want to work here, and do you want full time or part time. After that, they sat me down in the previous room and said to wait for my name to be called. So, I sat down, semi-patiently, and waited for my name to be called. Not even 5 minutes later and my name was called, as well as NP and a few other people. We were all congratulated and offered jobs. I was so relieved, but, not as relieved as NP. He was fully expecting not to get picked. I was happy for him. As we were going to sign our paperwork, I told one of the HR representatives that I had two other interviews later today. (Another HR representative said “You have 3 interviews? That’s amazing!” That put a huge smile on my face.) They were like “Well, do you want to do your other interviews or take this one?” I said I would like to do the other ones and see how I like them. They said “Okay, so, you can do your other interviews and if you want to pick another position, that’s fine. So, I went back down to do the process all over again for my 2nd interview to be a Bus Person. When I went to sign in, I saw someone (IKY for I Know You) who looked a little familiar but couldn’t put my finger on it. He dapped me up like he knew me. I asked him “Wait, do you know who I am?” He was like “I don’t know you but I recognize you from somewhere.” I was telling him how the interviews are going to go down, from the questions they will ask, to what happens if you make it past the first interview. When it was time for us to go to our group interviews, IKY ended up being in the same group as me. I gave him a pat on the back saying “you got this” and to acknowledge him and not pretend like I didn’t speak to him 10 minutes ago. So, we do the group interviews and they pretty much asked me the same questions in the first interview, maybe one being changed. As IKY was speaking, he mentioned that he went to the same high school as me and that’s why he looked so familiar. After we answered our questions, the hiring managers left to pick who is moving to the next interviews. I spoke to IKY and said “So, that’s where I know you from.” He graduated two years after I did. We got to talking about past classmates that we knew/remembered. When the managers came back, they said we all are moving on to the next interview. Now, I’m thinking to myself that I was going to get offers for all 3 jobs. So, they brought us to the same room where we had to wait for our name to be called. I was talking to this girl who applied to work at a Starbucks and talked about our positions/pay per hour. She was really pleasant. IKY came from his interview and sat next to me. We were all casually talking until our names were called. Again, they brought us out of the room to congratulate us. I told the same HR representative that I had another offer. She said “Go do your last interview and we’ll go from there. So, the last interview was for a Busser/Runner. I did the group interview and wait until the hiring managers make their decisions. I started talking to the girl next to me, who was *FINE* as fuck. Like NP, she was nervous and also had an accent that made it seem like English was her 2nd language. I reassured her that she will get the 2nd interview because you just had to answer the questions and you’re basically all set. Well, when the hiring managers came back, they called the girl that I was talking to. I thought that was weird because the last two interviews, they called everyone’s name. She was gone for awhile, so, I assumed they were going to do one-on-one interviews one at a time instead of them bringing us to the next room and waiting until our name is called. The hiring manager came back and congratulated us for making it to the 2nd interview. I felt like I jinxed the girl because she ended up not getting picked when I told her there’s a high possibility that she was going to get picked. (I shrugged it off but I wish I had the chance to ask for her number but it would have been highly inappropriate at an interview and plus I barely spoke to her. She was that fine to me and didn’t look intimidating.) My name gets called for the 2nd interview. I did that and waited for my name to be called. I was actually kind of nervous that I didn’t get this job because it took them longer to call my name, but, they ended up calling my name as well as others. So, I ended up getting 3 offers. I had to sign one offer before I left, but, I’m going to change my offer to something else. (There’s more to this story but it’s not that important. I’ll shorten it. It was now time for me to pick an offer. I had to wait 2.5 hours just for my name to be called. I almost fell asleep because I was up for 20 hours. I was up at 7pm the previous night and by the time I was done with the whole process, it was 5:15pm the next day.) "
qcagfa,"I am useless. I’m 18 years old and I haven’t had my first job yet, I can’t make simple appointment phone calls, I don’t have my drivers license and I’m not going outside either, I can’t do anything and I feel so shitty and embarrassed."
f2iu07s, Start leaving the house now even if it’s just to walk to the mailbox. Start getting outside in the world now. Once your used to that take the next small step and then the next one. Build up to it. 
ewjtpr7," Literally had this shit happen to me a few weeks ago. Had an hour to kill so I built up the courage to go to the local cafe and order a fucking coffee. Lots of anxiety but I got over it and when I got the cup of coffee I whipped out my phone and started browsing Reddit. I was there ALONE. And the fucking barista SCORNED me for using a phone. So I downed the drink, paid, and went to the park to sit on a goddamn bench like a hobo. Fuck this life. I can never do anything without someone expressing disapproval with my actions. No matter what. "
ev1vkto," I wish I had your courage to do those things. I love being outdoors, going for walks, etc, but I’m scared to death of being seen by people and I feel so out of place and unwanted. I hate doing nothing, being alone and isolated, but it feels like every time I try it gets harder. "
8qc1ov,"I never thought my social anxiety would be this bad. Hey , Idk why I am writing this but here's my rant about my anxiety. Yesterday, I finally found the time to go to my local indoor rock climbing center and and registered for an unlimited one- week pass. I thought it would be a great way to try something new and fun (and also because I don't exercise at all haha). Today, after a looot of time battling my anxiety, I went. It took me hours to get ready since I didn't want to leave my peaceful house where nothing and no one bothers me. I first entered and felt super awkward. I changed my clothes and and arrived at the actual climbing place (is there any word for it?). Anyway, you can guess what happened next. I panicked. No, I didn't panic because of the scary heights. I panicked because there were a lot of people. I felt like everyone was watching me. It's important to mention that I was the youngest one there (I am 16 and the majority of the climbers were in their twenties). For some reason, it adds even more pressure and anxiety. Also, I felt super bad because everyone was with their friends and I was alone and i don't know why it made me feel even more awkward. It wanted to run way. I did, actually. I went upstairs and took my bag and I ran away. I was having an anxiety attack and I can't even put it into words how awful it was. I'm sure you can understand. Anyway, my point is that I never understood how much social anxiety impacted me. I go through a lot of mental disorder problems but social anxiety &amp; generalized anxiety is quite new to me. It just sucks. I used to be a very social creature and I loved going out. Now I can't even go outside without being scared. My self esteem is just gone. Every little event like this destroys me even more. P.S.: Sorry for the grammar mistakes, English isn't my first language"
o64g0n," Who else feels you've grown up too fast?. (23, M) Is it just me or does everyone else feel as if you grew up too fast? Yesterday, my mom and I were swimming in our backyard pool and she asked me this question after seeing bubble wrap in my closet: OP, do you ever plan on moving out anytime soon?"" Mom didn't say this as if she wanted me to move out, it was a touchy question, I said ""No, mom, I'm ready to live on my own, socially."" Physically and financially I can live on my own if I wanted to, I know how to pay bills, go to my appointments, run my own errands, etc. But, I lack the social aspects of living on my own. If I wanted to move out and find an apartment, I'd rather find roommates so I don't feel alone. I do believe I grew up too fast. I almost never got to hang out with friends from school or work, go to sleepovers, invited to parties, exchanging no #s with anyone besides my parents and extended family. Even if I did go to social events or gatherings, I wasn't present or having fun, I was always in my head, worrying about what the world thought of me. I'm 23 but I do express my inner 12 year old self because I feel like I almost NEVER had a childhood. I missed out on A LOT. "
6hhke7," Self-confidence issues/lifetime social anxiety. Hey everyone, I posted this in r/mentalhealth as well, just so I can get more feedback and hear more stories. I'm a 22 year old male who has had self-confidence problems my whole life and I'm truly wondering if you all think a therapist could REALLY help. I saw one a few years back and I thought he was just giving me answers straight from a psych textbook that didn't help me whatsoever. I'm cynical in general, but I don't want to keep having self-confidence issues my entire life. The thing is, I've always had very strong self-awareness. I know what my lack of self confidence stems from. I know being made fun of by adults and kids alike for being skinny and small for years (I'm 5'8 and 145 pounds now, so pretty normal/average), left a profound impact on me. Having the music teacher in 5th grade tell me to sit down because I wasn't tall enough to play George Washington in a play, being pushed around by guys and condescended towards, etc. I saw myself as being judged based on my physical characteristics and being bullied/made fun of for that. I now know that my embarrassment to take my shirt off at the beach or at pools from the age of like 12 came from this. I now know that my inability to make strong eye contact when talking with people comes from this. I know that my uncomfortableness expressing emotions with people comes from this. I know that my crumbling when public speaking comes from this. I know that the reason I wore sweatshirts when it was 80 degrees out was because I was/still am embarrassed to show my skinny arms. And I know that my constant unstable relationships with women and my need to criticize others comes from this. I'm not depressed, I'm not suicidal, I don't hate the way I look in the mirror most days, and I'm certainly not anti-social, but my lack of self-confidence is so ingrained into me that it pops up in ways that aren't as simple as thinking I'm unattractive in the mirror. It's the reason why anytime a woman actually has interest in me, I lose feelings and run away. It's the reason why I am so preoccupied with a desire for sex (even when I physically don't want it), because in my mind, if someone is sexually interested in me, they desire me, and all I've wanted is to be desired physically and receive that approval. I could go on and on and I really appreciate anyone who has read this far. Only in the past few years have I connected the dots that I've been battling poor self-confidence my entire life. And while most people don't notice it in me on a day-to-day basis, it sincerely affects my life and my relationships particularly with women. I want to feel good about myself and it's not as simple as just telling myself I look good. It's so deeply ingrained that it manifests it in ways that are subconscious. How can I be helped? Can a therapist really help or will they give me BS answers that I already know, that won't address the problem? "
7z4ld6," Anyone else feel really anxious in university libraries?. The thought of bumping into someone (especially if I perceive them as cooler than me ) makes me really anxious. I like to be prepared to meet someone so I can breath and prepare what I'm going to say. Not to mention, how they are so many people around you. I can feel comfortable in a library when its only 20-30% occupied. Another interesting point, is if the library was outdoors for arguments sake, I don't think I would feel anxious at all. I don't know if anyone else has this, but being outside where its cooler and less claustrophobic means I'm less likely to blush and more likely to keep my cool. "
6c9gor," DAE get stressed and anxious before leaving the house but whenever you're out you feel like it's not so bad then whenever you're returning home you want to stay out?. I never really leave the house or have any friends and it takes me way longer than it should to get ready and actually leave. I'm pretty sure I have body dysmorphia and social anxiety, I'm always self conscious about my appearance so it's hard for me to do anything but if I know I look alright on that day and I leave the house, I want to stay out. I always get scared about seeing anyone I know in public though. Sometimes I leave the house just to bike around or go to McDonalds because I feel like I don't want to hide myself away and have no one ever see me but at the same time I get worried that everyone is judging me when I'm around a lot of strangers. Then whenever I get home, I feel bad because sometimes I want to go out again. I never know what to do when I go out because the town that I live in is so boring and I probably need friends to have fun. I want to do fun things and live the life I want to but it's just so hard. I really don't understand this horrible thing that I've been dealing with for a quarter of my life now. It sucks that we are all going through this and I hope my life and all of your lives improve in the near future. Thank you for reading. Let me know if anyone else is going through this! "
fmx7zui," Yes. I live in a national park in employee (communal) housing. I live in a until with my bf and I absolutely refuse to cook in the kitchen, because it is communal. If I’m in there alone and some weird guy comes in, I get an instant panic attack and have to leave. My boyfriend does all the cooking for that reason. Even just going on a walk gives me anxiety. Going to the store is a living, breathing nightmare. It doesn’t help that I’m attractive(not trying to boast in any way) causing tons of men and sometimes women to stare at me nonstop. I refuse to go anywhere without my boyfriend because I get less stares when he’s around. This even happened in childhood as I developed breasts and a womanly shape early. I noticed when I went out with my mom I would get stared at but when I went out with my dad no one dared to stare at me. "
hfn16f6," Its actually my second time alone in a hotel, but last year I just spent every time up in the room save for dinner and breakfast. But this year I'm walking around town, going in the pool and even tried rhe sauna! Well for me the worsr part of my phobia came when I was in college and in the years after I dropped out. I had anxiety before too, but I could still manage to go out. I have a therapist too, i'm also on meds and they help and in the last year I made friends here on Reddit. I think talking about anything every day made it easier to open up irl too. "
feg9isw,"Too relatable... It's true though, people will think you're weirder for *not* talking than for just saying whatever is on your mind. Kinda learnt that the hard way, by the time I realised everyone thought I was weird it was too late to start acting like a normal human being. I was literally just known as 'that weird emo girl who never talks,' I don't know how I made any friends at all. It's been 2 and a half years since I left that school and I still think about it sometimes. Even worse is that apparently I haven't learnt anything because I still don't talk, in fact I barely go outside at all now"
s6ptbg, I found out where i lose my social anxiety. Im an avid snowboarder that lives on the east coast. East coast has crappy ski resorts and is really just people who are doing it for one day. I went to Colorado as my first big snowboarding trip and i had so many conversations and actually new what to talk about. I have to leave tomorrow morning. It’s the first time I’ve felt like I’ve fit in. I don’t want to leave. 
do1dwf4,Wish I could go hiking but have no one to go with and couldn't do it alone 
g71b4zr,"I can relate by how my feet are wide. I had a high school ""friend"", and I remember he made a comment on how my feet were so wide when we were getting lunch toghrter. I'm now 21, and I still walk on the outer part of my feet so they appear less wide. I also don't know if I have a nerd neck, but I do know I have really bad posture when sitting. So every time I walk, I always walk with my chest to the sun, looking straight ahead to appear more confident then I actually am."
em2qj42," Jokin. Wish I could talk to you, but we dont have stuff to talk about. I live in Israel, like video games, biking and running. Hope you will find someone tho! "
ir07u7,I Have social anxiety and my parents think I'm embarrassed of them. Today I went to my school bc i was joining the soccer team and they had a game today so I went to go meet my coach and the girls. my mom drove me their and when i got there we couldn't find the field (theres 2) the one we were suppose to go to was behind the school but we didn't know how to get their and we didn't want to go anywhere students werent allowed so then my mom asked me to ask a person that was passing by but I was too scared to (I have social anxiety) and it was kinda cold outside so my mom said if I wasn't gonna ask them were leaving. and she started yelling loud in our language. so then when we were driving back she thought I was embarrassed of her and she started going after me and insulting me and saying a lot if horrible things. she thinks I'm embarrassed of her cuz were foreign and that's not even why 😕 but she doesn't know I have social anxiety and I started crying because she was yelling at me and I didn't know how to tell her. we don't really have a good relationship I don't talk to her about stuff so please does anyone have advice. I'm 14 btw.
4nm6g3," Social Anxiety at the beach. So I'm at the beach in Florida for the week and this is the first year that I've realized I have social anxiety and it makes the beach less enjoyable. I've been going to this same beach for my whole life 19 years and we go with a huge group of family friends and other ppls friends and it's almost a 100 ppl this year, and meeting all these ppl again when I only see them once a year just is triggering my anxiety which for the most part is pretty manageable. Also my friends will be getting here a day later then I am so it will improve a lot when they get here but I just don't think the beach is too enjoyable when you have SA. Even one of the best parts should be at least seeing a bunch of girls in bikinis but even then in the back of my head it's just like what does that matter you can't talk to them, never done anything with a girl, so that part is kind of depressing I guess. So do any of y'all have any tips outside of the normal ones of calming yourself down. Also I'm sorry I come off as like a spoiled brat for saying how I'm not enjoying a vacation at a beach when I'm blessed that I'm able to come here every year. "
oettvl," All the things no one tells you about anxiety. Hello, Since anxiety has become “main stream”, i’ve noticed all the things that they don’t talk about on social media and tv that we have to go through every day. I’ve taken the time to make this list of anxiety symptoms and things that no one ever talks about. I have no doubt that this list will make you say “me”. Im really sharing because i’d love your help to make this list better and i’ve spent so much time on it. It would be great if you could put a comment on this article with any symptoms or things i’ve missed that you deal with or anything that really hits home for you. Thank you!! [19 Anxiety Things No One Ever Talks About]("
fnq1yo3," My social anxiety is more directed towards coworkers. So it's important to kinda consider what you are willing to work with and arent. My therapist had told me about considering a job where I can control when I do or dont want to talk. A job that allows you to practice when you want or can. Theres even degree ideas for people with social anxiety like computer programmers cause they're jobs that require minimal talking. For me, I enjoy doing Uber Eats where I'm from cause talking is minimal (especially with this pandemic going on, most people want you to just leave it at their door). All I have to do is tell a worker at whatever restaurant "" I'm here for doordash for *insert doordash name*"" ""thank you"" and leave it at their door. If I do see the person all I say is ""have a good one"" and quickly get to my car (people really just care that their food is dropped off so they're really not judging like that). Next order! No need to talk to coworkers, I'm not worrying that I'm being judged. Just delivery and listening to music I genuinely enjoy. Sign up for delivery, be a dog Walker. Work at a library. I also work at the irs (tenprorarily) I like it there because they even have a policy in orientation to not judge people: to basically not judge and we all have our strengths and weakness, thus are equal. So far nobody has judged me like people do in more extroverted areas like restaurants (I recommened avoiding restaurants unless you feel it's something you can take on). At that job I'm also able to hang myself and not worry and I can talk to anyone and people are open. Some are mean but some people are gonna be mean. We just gotta learn how to handle it and that's ok too to make mistakes. My coworker actually told me about how two girls made fun of her hair: Mean chicks: *snickering* ""hey your hair a weave?"" My coworker: "" Nah this is natural. Why? Yours isnt?"" Inside I'm like ""OOH BURNN, TELL THEM GIRLFRIEN"" Outside I dont show emotion cause I feel I express stuff awkwardly sometimes. working on it though. I know its tough dude but I know you can make a badass comeback 👊 doesnt matter how worthless you think you are or what others make out of you. You can totally be a better and stronger you and there is people who understand us and will accept us for us. For me, a person who has social anxiety and has been depressed, has been talked about my coworkers and managers about being odd or something (or a loner or pushover) I've show my true colors to my fiance who had honestly made me feel most loved, even during times when I might've not been focused on him at all. During my ugly times we've pushed through the dark times and sometimes some people have to be their own hero. Cause even with my fiance I still have to do my part in loving myself. I also have a friend who's experiences SAD and shes accepted me despite not having ti hang out a lot. I met her at my old job. We were both quiet and she just so happened to have SAD too. Not everyone who is quiet is that way though. One dude was just naturally quiet but laid back and happy and mixed more with the coworkers that didnt like me. What's important is you out yourself first and make time to be a happier you. You're gonna fail. Yohre gonna take a step back after making progress sometimes. You're gonna cry. But it will be better for as lo g as you keep getting back up at some point "
rwdqll," How do I make friends. 15M, this is a burner account. In elementary/middle school, I was an outgoing kid and I made a lot of friends in my school. I felt really comfortable around my peers and actually enjoyed school. Over COVID, my family made the decision to move across the country. When I started my 8th grade year, I was so socially awkward, nothing like I was before. I would hardly say anything in an entire school day, and whenever someone would talk to me my face would get really red and I wouldn’t know what to say. This behavior continued throughout the whole year, I didn’t manage to make a single friend. I never knew what to say when someone tried to talk to me. Going into my high school year, I thought it was going to be different. After all, nobody knew each other so everybody would be trying to make friends. I was wrong. Although I talked a bit more in class, I am still insanely awkward. I think my issue is that it’s really difficult for me to express my thoughts. I can think of something perfectly good in my head, but when I try to convey that thought I sound like a moron. I also get really confused on simple social queues. For example, when somebody waves at me, I try to smile and wave back but I end up looking really stupid and I get really flustered. I also have no clue how to go up to somebody and start a conversation. Eye contact is also really confusing for me, like when I look around the classroom and I try to avoid looking at people but then the deliberate avoidance makes me look like more of a creep. I really want to make friends, because it’s already halfway through my freshman year and I haven’t gone out a single night. I really hate school right now just because I feel like such a social outcast. How do I overcome my issues and make actual friends? "
eu4fgz8, I feel the same way. I have my school friends and then there my friends from my old tennis team. It feels like a weird and awkward crossover but it never ended up being bad. In fact some of my friends school friends even founded themselves dates or new close friendship from the my tennis team bunch. If you think it will make things better for your colleague then I see no harm. The first few weeks may make you feel a little odd and like in a parallel universe (that is how I would put it at least) but that will also go away soon. Good luck fren! 
f22gl6o,I was just thinking this today actually. My final (5th) year of university is about to start next week and throughout all these years I have literally been the only loner. **Everyone** else has someone (usually a group). And I still don't even know where to sit every day. Not to mention the torture of those occasional long breaks between classes when everyone just goes for coffee with their friends/groups or whatever and I'm the only one who's left alone to chain smoke on a hidden bench for 2 hours. Still hurts every time lol
eg7gsk8,"My heart hurts for you. I wish I could make the pain go away but I know that there will always be that little pin prick.nnIt's not your last chance at happiness. The sun still shines, there are still Weezer songs to listen to, there are amazing things out there from cities to mountains to rain forests. Not everyday will be happy and life has amazing ups and absolutely horrible downs. But, well, if you look for the light you will find it. It's hard, but you have to take joy in the little things and try to push yourself to keep up at least a few fun hobbies. "
p859ba,"I mustered up all my courage to say ""good morning"" and it did not go well. When I went on my walk this morning, there was an abnormally huge amount of people outside doing things in their yards/on the porch, etc. As I was walking by one house, there was a couple sitting on their porch smoking or something, and I saw them staring slantways at me and sort of whispering/laughing to themselves as I walked past. I still mustered up literally all the courage I had to turn toward them, smile, say ""good morning"" to them in my weak shaky voice, and even give a small wave. But they just stared at me like I was the stupidest, creepiest person they had ever seen. And then, because I didn't want to miss out in case they did finally wave back, I *looked at them a second time* (which was super creepy, I'm sure) and they were still staring at me like I was stupid. Like, I tried. I really did. What's so wrong with me that I can't even say ""good morning"" right? Am I just unlikeable? Am I inherently weird and that can never be changed?  and#x200B; **Edit:** Just wanted to say thank you to everyone for your kind words, encouragement, insight, and tips. Sorry if I came across as overdramatic or complaining in this post; I was not in the best mood lol. I'll keep trying to take baby steps like I did today, and hopefully have better experiences (or at least not care as much if I don't). I'll also try to look at things more from other people's perspective and consider other reasons people might react (or not react) a certain way. I really appreciate all the positivity and constructive feedback/advice from everyone :)"
dig5b4w,"i avoid strength training as my goal right now isn't muscular hypertrophy but atrophy. i have minor lumbar scoliosis, it in itself isn't a real problem, but the twisted ribcage and imbalanced flexibility offsets my muscular development. it had become quite asymmetric and disproportionate, and due to being physically hypersensitive as well the protrusion and the like aggravate me to no end. so i do jogging 6 days a week.nni've watched a couple of his videos, don't find myself particularly attracted to his teachings, but they do provide some value for sure."
fm29llg, Aha I have a similar story. I was riding my skateboard in the centre of town and there was a kind of change in the surface of the road. I think you can guess what happened next. I suddenly stopped and went flying into a couple. Landed straight on my face in front of 50 people( was busy that day). I messaged my friend and laughed about it. Instead of making you afraid of long boarding you should just look back at this and laugh. It kills the anxiety and lightens your ego. Good luck : ) 
3n4vp0," [23M] tiny social circle, can't ""sexualize conversation"" at gym (or anywhere). I know the gym's a bad place, but I'm not in school, made a bad impression on girls at work, don't have friends that would take me to bars or anywhere, drinking at parties is awkward and I'm usually not invited, and I'm not expecting to meet women at meetup events... so I'm making due/necessity is the mother of invention. Problem is all conversations are awkward, and most are very brief (10-30 seconds). The one long conversation was next to a girl on the elliptical, and I would describe it as me interviewing or interrogating her, with practically NO elements of playfulness, flirtatiousness or sexual humor thrown in. I asked her how big her new apartment was [she moved in August to NC to start grad school], 3 baths. Oh that's big. Yeah it's pretty big. Well what if your roommates leave, then you're stuck with the bill.........such a playful thing to say, no? That conversation ended with me asking how often she trains lats/rear delts (never seen her do it), which is creepy cause i'm admitting to watching her while she works out. She's like, oh never, I don't use those for running, my sport. I'm like well you don't use pecs for running, but you do a lot of pushing movements/chest exercises (this is me trying to indirectly tease her for her A cups). She's like yeah OK i guess i could do more rowing movements. Then i say ""that's all I'm saying"", when really I wanted to say more. then she gets up and leaves the gym. never saw her again, hope she's enjoying NC. i could have saved myself time and heartache had i avoided interview mode, opened with a simple compliment (clothes match your hair), asked her name, and for a date (i'm afraid to give compliments, never sure what to follow up with) So forget that girl. Next one is older, 27, done with school, has a 1 y/o baby girl, makes good money as a registered nurse. In July we make eye contact 3 seconds, smile. I don't see her again til a few weeks ago (cause we usually go at different times, but i've had my work schedule changed just to stalk her a few mornings each week basically). As she's leaving, I head her off, ask if she works late or why she's never here in the evening. Says it's because of her baby girl and the daycare only being open til 6pm, and she also says she works 4pm-9pm. The baby girl thing surprises me, and i'm like ""OH, ok"" To break the awkward silence, I ask how long she's been a member here, 4 years. She asks me, 6 months, and she asks if i like it, yeah it's a nice place I say. Then I say ""bye, take care"". A week goes by, i corner her again as she's leaving, ask if she also takes the little one to work, no grandma acts as a nanny. She says she works as a nurse at a hospital, asks what I do. I work at Kroger. She's not impressed. Ask how old the baby is, almost one. At this point I thought maybe I'm not too much in interrogate/interview mode, cause her face actually lights up, her mouth opens and, without thinking, for a moment I triangulate my view between it and her eyes. Her face flattens, she turns to leave, and tells her baby to say goodbye to me, which the baby didn't say :(. Another week goes by before we're at the gym at the same time, this time I really feel pressured to make a move. I almost asked about her living arrangements, but figured that's bad. Almost tried to tell her I was new to town and wanted to be shown around, but I don't want to have to remember lies (I've lived here all my life). So what bright idea do I have in mind this time, you wonder? Well I corner her again and complement her baby for walking well at 1 year old, mom giggles, thanks me. I ask what she would think of a photo, cause I don't mind she's in sweatpants and a sweater, I could still jerk to it or get a buddy to rate. ""Oh no!"" she says in a flat tone. I say her girl walks really well, back off, and hobble back to my squat rack, trying not to give off the impression that a dagger has just been plunged in my heart. I've approached other girls, even staff members, asking how long they've been here, what they think of a particular exercise, what they study in school, if they have a special diet, how often they go out with friends...basically good opening questions, but it's like a sandwich with no meat or toppings, just bread. I could ask with my flat affect, monotonous voice, lack of facial or bodily expression for her phone number or to show me around the town, but this would just be like another interview question. So basically I'm bad at making conversation and observing common social sense. I don't have much to say, hardly anything at all playful or flirtatious to say, and end up asking interview-like questions, being serious, or when I try to flirt, sounding desperate or creepy. I want to have playful things to say, to steer or control the direction of the conversation, and ultimately to make a timely move. I don't want to feel as if I'm interviewing a girl, steering the conversation somewhere meaningless, seeming interested in her without making a move (in short, I don't want to feel as if I'm being a desperate coward/wimp/wussy... but i have bad social anxiety and have never been much of a man...) I leave this impression on the staff members that I am very shy, quiet, but nice. I must leave this impression on girls of being very interested in them because of repeated approaches, but also desperate, awkward, not alpha, unsure how to pursue orhow to bridge the gap... all because of a poverty of things to say. Also I am a virgin with a dull personality so getting a date is a first step, and I won't know how to get intimate, but I will try. I'm convinced this is a necessary first step given I have no female interaction and none are seeking me out (no female friends practically, well I see them very rarely and somewhere noisy). As I said, I work at Kroger, so low social status. I have anxiety/character issues working against me too. Pretty much the only thing I have going for me is my appearance. 5'11"" 170lbs 11%bf masculine jaw dressed to impress. to the gym i wear nice sketchers (converse for leg day), cotton shorts and t-shirts (but it's not mattering, girls do judge a book by more than it's cover, being offset by my financial and social and emotional poverty) "

8byoc4,"How I Cured My Social Anxiety + Found My True Self. I am a 19-year-old male. I did not always have social anxiety, but I believe I started out with very very moderate SA and it worsened over time until I cured it just recently around February or March, I don't remember the exact date, but it was in 2018. I am so glad I finally cured my SA because it was really affecting my life negatively and it caused so much loneliness and depression. The loneliness and depression didn't occur until my 6th or 7th grade year at my middle school, but it was at its all-time worst during my high school years. Before the day I cured it, I had difficulty expressing myself, communicating with ANYONE, going anywhere where I was in risk to having to speak with someone or seen by anyone, small things like cutting the grass, doing my jobs, going to the store, and even seeing my own family at get togethers I would not be able to speak to them.n	Some things that held me back from being myself because of the SA include: meeting new people, being terrified to interact with others-especially girls, skipping school because I had a presentation that day, not being able to my perform to my best abilities at any of my sports games, quitting my travel soccer team because one of my coaches made us do random things like dance or say something goofy in front of the team and I wasn't cool with that at the time, instead of hanging out with friends I would rather just hide and play video games or watch anime, I couldn't even talk to my first ever girlfriend in 7th grade (I have no idea why she liked me. Keep in mind she did not know my true self-only my SA self), and the list goes on. Social anxiety caused these things and made me a complete loner for a great portion of my life. At first, I thought it was just how I was and I was an extremely shy kid, but as I grew older I knew deep down inside that I was a very outgoing person and knowing this made my sadness even worse. At home, only my close family knew the true me. I was always dancing around the house, making everyone laugh, being a clown basically. It felt impossible for me to change during middle school/ high school because everyone knew me as that one ºmute¹ kid and whenever my quietness was questioned, I felt awful because I knew everyone only knew the fake version of myself. It would have been very difficult to just outright change during these times because the anxiety was just too much.n	When I went off to college, I thought I would change easily, but the symptoms were still there. This was the lowest point of my life where I felt like an outsider and I just hid my depression from everyone. I never gave up on life though because I always believed and prayed to God that I would find that happy life that everyone else seemed to have while I was just sitting alone at that lunch table trying to figure out why I am so different from everyone else. After many nights of crying myself to sleep, I finally stopped running from my problems and started searching for answers. Instead of going to see a doctor like a normal person without SA would, I solved my own problem with the use of the internet. At the time, I thought I was just an extremely shy person, but I found out that I definitely had social anxiety with a simple google search. I actually found out that tons of people have my same issue and that gave me tons of confidence to finally change myself. Now I just needed to find out how to cure my anxiety. The biggest recommendation by people online was to get out of your comfort zone. My comfort zone was at my computer all day with no human interaction so I couldn't even imagine doing that. So, what I did was take very small baby steps( my change was very gradual). I was brave enough to put myself in situations where I was forced to speak to people. I had a little bit of experience at my paper route job, but I needed more work.n	Big changes occurred during the time I started working as a security guard. I was always forced to speak to people and this gave me so much more confidence. It was a lot of standing around too so the only thing too pass the time was speaking with my coworkers. I will call one of the coworkers John. John was a great influence on my life because he taught me it is okay to be yourself, how to have fun during work, communicate with people, and enjoy life in general. He did not teach me directly all these things, I learned by his example when observing him. This job also gave me many realizations on life because at the same time I was committing an awful sin-stealing money. At first, deep down I did feel very guilty, but as I kept doing it it became easier and I stole much more each time, but of course the karma got to me and I was nearly caught. I believe I did receive a sign from God because one night after finished working, while the boss of my job was counting the money he told me I was 20 bucks short. I kept my cool knowing that I did in fact steal money that day and he told me it was no big deal and let me go. As I was leaving his office he ends up finding the 20 dollars hiding between a white paper where the money is held and lets me know. I took this as a blatant sign from God and decided to never commit a sin ever in my life again. S/o to ºPulp Fiction¹ and my idol Jules Winnfield. My favorite movie and character off all time. After this day I realized money is not the most important thing in this life and I believe the most important thing is happiness and ºPulp Fiction¹ does an amazing job of portraying this message. I also believe that anyone can change themselves for the better and stay on the righteous path of life. I know the character Jules has committed much worse crimes than me, but I feel like I completely relate to him because he also receives a sign from God while in the act of sinning . Jules is the man I respect, look up to, and definitely influenced me to become the ºshepherd¹ in my life- s/o Quentin as well he's the homie.n	Another thing that helped me cure my social anxiety was getting into social media. On Snapchat, I was lucky enough to make my username a very popular anime character's name. Having this username had many people randomly add me because it is such a popular anime and character. One of those people is a very important girl- I'll call her Jane. Jane is important to me because she helped me develop better social skills, gave me someone to speak to while I was very lonely, gave me more confidence in myself, helped me realize that it is not scary at all to speak to girls, and we were able to bond through similar interests. Sadly, I had to block her because she was becoming way too attached to me and claimed she loved me even though we never met. She is still young and needs to mature, but I definitely plan on meeting her in the future because she is very important to me. Hopefully she does not hold a grudge against me and understands why I blocked her.n	The next important person that helped change me was a girl I met through Tinder- I'll call her Stephanie. I don't know if meeting her was a crazy coincidence or another sign from God because we share many things in common. Before meeting her in person, when we were talking on Snap we had the same sense of humor, same randomness, she doesn't know how to swim like me, a little color blind like me, and many more very specific things. I just had to meet her right away because I almost had the feeling she was my soul mate or something lol. I drove to her area and we hung out for the day. I did not make any moves on her besides a hi and bye hug because she gave off more of a little sister vibe. That day I also realized another thing about myself- I don't like to see anyone sad and I want to show people how they could find happiness like me. I realized this when she told me about her past breakups and I also realized that she is not very confident in her appearance. This made me very sad to hear and I hope one day she will be happy or I could help her out in some way one day. She is a very good friend and I plan on hanging out with her many times in the future. Stephanie contributed to curing my social anxiety by helping me figure out myself more by finding out that I am interested in becoming a counselor, more confidence, better social skills, being with a girl alone for the first-time fear, and she also gave me more confidence to be myself.n	These events in my life led me to cure my social anxiety and another plus- finding and being my true self. As of right now I am actually really bummy lol because I withdrew from all my college classes knowing that I plan to change my major to a counselor related field in the fall and also there is no work for me right now, but that no excuse either because I should be applying to jobs I'm just being lazy lol- something else I need to fix pls help. I would say my social anxiety is completely cured, but I rarely have some general anxiety when in a place where English is not the common language (I plan on learning more languages), in sketchy type places or hoods, and when I see people that knew me as that one quiet kid. Lately I have been sad about not having a girlfriend, but that's just because there is not much to do in my boring ass city, but I know that I just have to continue to be me and get out the house as much as I can. Cali looks like the fucking dream place frfr. Nowadays I am talkative with anyone, can hold a conversation, living life how I want to and enjoying it every day, and my favorite thing I like to do is make someones day and make them smile. My plans/goals/wishes for the future include: becoming a ºshepherd¹- just someone that people look up to and hopefully I can set them on the right path, maybe becoming a counselor, maybe become famous or something lmao, write a book of my life, writing a book on how to cure social anxiety that branches off into curing general anxiety maybe, make many connections with people, learn how to swim LOL, finding my true love someday, and just helping anyone that is going through some shit because I've been there and it's the worse feeling, but I believe anyone can find what makes them happy if I can. nMy biggest inspirations are Jules Winnfield, Naruto Uzumaki, and myself.nJules - Stay on the righteous path.nNaruto - Follow your dreams/passions-always believe in yourself!nMe - And lastly, just be you.nPlease respect my opinions and religious views. Thank you! If you have any comments or questions feel free to ask and I will try to answer them all!n"
pvv1p1,"4 day trip went better than expected?. 3 days ago I posted in hereabiiut how much I was dreading this entertainement trip my uni was organising. It started with my best friend not being able to make it and so I was stuck in an awkward losition because I don't know a lot of people and I was sitting alone in the bus while everyone was in pairs and having fun. Anyway, slowly things started getting better. I met some nice people at dinner and we then went on and played some fun activities together ( playimg games mostly). I decided to stick to this group of 4 people ammd wewould go swimming and eating together. Anyway at the 1st day we had a DJ party at night and everyone was dancing but nit me because I chickened out and feared looking awkward whiile dancing. I got sad once it was over because I geniuely wamted to dance but my SA stopped me from having fun. 2nd day, I swore this was gonna be the day I break that mental block and dancey heart out so i stayed in my room practicing some danceoves. Fastforward to the eveninng, there was a Kareoke event at the hotel and I didn't participate in it either because I was feeling self conscious about my voice and people judging me. However, once it was over and music started blasting and everyone jumped forward and started dancing,I decided that I had enough and I'll never grow as a person if i don't face my fears. I forced my body to obey me and it was kinda weird for the 1st 2 mns but then, i loosened up and started relacing and boi that did feel good. I was enjoying myself and didn't care a out how weird I might have looked because I realized that if I myself can't focus on damcing and watching ppl simultaneously, neither can they. everyone was busy with themselves. I danced for a good 30 mns then I stopped. I slept like a baby that night because I felt like I had a small victory. 3rd day : A large group decided to go hang outside and then go to entertainment park to play some games. I was invited and I felt so happy I could take part of it. The hamgout was good and I had a good moment, but the bigfest accomplishement came after. Height was always one of my biggest fears growing up. I didn't like the sensation of being so far up in the air and never played any kind of dangerous games in emtertainement parks. I decided today to conquer that fear and add another victory to the history books. And I DID!! there was this crazy ship game that dangles so high in the air that makese shiver looking at it. Anyway I decided to grab my courage with my 2 hands and try it. Thr fact that we were a large group made it a little easier tbh. The sensation was crazy,I was legit scared and screaming my heart out. However once I got down i felt an overwhelming sense of accomplishement and satisfaction. It's like proving haters wrong except in this case the hater was my own mind, my anxiety. That's it folks, it may not be a big deal but for me it seemed like it was, I' m glad that this trip went better than expected and it proved to me how SA can make you waste you so many great opportunities in life. Sorry for the bad english and I hope you're all doing well"
t2j4zh,"Just a rant. 22M here. Senior in college but coming back for a 5th year next year. College has been by far the worst experience of my life. At this point, I know I have to finish and graduate as to not do so would be spitting in the faces of my parents who worked so hard to make sure I got a college degree. That’s not a big deal. But the last time I felt like a normal person was my senior year in high school, when I actually had a great group of close friends and overall felt okay about my life. Fast forward 4 years, and I have no friends in college(all my friend live in different states and most of them I have stopped talking to on a consistent basis) even though I’m on the soccer team have 3 roommates etc. My biggest fear has always been making other people uncomfortable or creeped out by my presence, especially women, and I have no idea how or why this started happening. (Ex/ if me and a girl are riding an elevator together by ourselves, I’ll purposely move to the far corner and avoid eye contact at all costs). Its almost as if the idea of someone knowing I’m attracted to them is the most embarrassing idea ever for some reason. I will go to extreme measures to seem disinterested in every girl I meet, with the idea of not coming off as a creep, and then feel bad that I’m basically a virgin (had sex 1 time 6 years ago). I’ve never been told I’m creepy or anything close to that, in fact I’m sure I just come off as a stuck up asshole who is full of himself, and at this point I don’t know how to change this. I guess what I’m trying to say is, as my time in college slowly starts to wind down, I feel like I’ve not only wasted some of what should have been the best year of my life, but have actively loathed my entire existence these past 4 years. I wish I had never gone to college. I wish I had never dated the only girlfriend I have ever had, as she made me feel like I had a chance of being a normal person, and it hurts even worse knowing I had a chance. I honestly don’t know how this happened, or what to do. I don’t see life getting better. I won’t ever do anything that can’t be undone because I know the effect it would have on my wonderful family, I could never do that to them, but I’ve felt utterly hopeless for years and see no way out. Anyways, that’s all I got. If u made it this far, congrats on having an iron will."
okswr4,"I'm lonely. I'm a 22 year old girl and I've been struggling with bad social anxiety ever since I can remember, which caused me to get to the point of having no friends nor any idea how to even make any, and almost a year ago now I finally decided to start the path of healing and take control of my life. I've joined a volunteering group I meet with once a week; I make my own phone calls; I feel little to no pressure when I have to do new things at work; I started jogging. I've noticed I'm becoming more forgiving of myself when committing mistakes, less self-conscious about my ""flaws"". Generally my self esteem has risen and my anxiety has dropped a bit. I've made progress but at the same time I feel like I've done nothing. I still don't know how to talk to people, nor how to make friends I think about all the experiences I should have had by now, all the people I could have met if only I wasn't like this. I feel extremely lonely and isolated from everyone, and lately just thinking about it has been like getting stabbed in the chest. It's the reason I feel suicidal on most days and it's the only thing I can't find a solution for. Sadly making friends is way harder than making a phone call, or going to the grocery store, or doing anything that only requires good will. I'm tired of this. Any advice would be great, though I know it's complicated to give any of this kind. Thank you if you read this."
mtkd0s," Unsure about boundaries with my horse's new owner. Hi, sorry if this does not belong here. I just need some reassurances and help in figuring out how to approach the subject. Sorry if some phrases don't make sense, sorry for the mess I am. During 7 years I took care of a lovely pony in my riding center, the owner trusted me with him and let me take care of him as if he were my own. I was and still am not able to afford a horse of my own. We formed a great bond, and during all these years he was my emotional support. The stables were my safe place in general, but spending time with that pony was 100% effective in making me feel better. When I start to feel low, I know it's time to go to the barn. But, sadly, the riding center had to close down a couple weeks ago. That was a really hard thing to accept because it really was the only place where I felt safe and like I belonged. But I've already grieved enough about it. I'm 19 now. The thing is, the owner had to find new homes for his ponies, and ""my"" pony and his best friend were adopted by a lovely girl (around 13 I think) and her family who owns a farm. Both of the ponies are quite old but still in great shape, so most of the days they chill in a field of grass, but the girl and one of her friend go on rides occasionally. I think it's a great situation for both the girls and the ponies, I really do. I'm over my sadness, now I just feel happy that my dear friend has a perfect life with girls who adore him, and I'm happy for the girls. Having your own horsie at home is the dream of every horse girl ! The girl and her family have told me that I can come see the ponies when I want to, but honestly ""when I want to"" would be every day. But it's not my horse anymore, and I want the girls to make the most of their new friends. I don't want to be that awkward older girl coming around all the time to spend time with a pony. Also it's their home, not an open riding center, I kinda feel intrusive. I went to see the horses twice in the last few weeks, and I was supposed to go again last week but it fell through. I have to ask the girl by message when I can come, and we usually go walk the horses together, which is really a big obstacle for me... I used to go to the barn whenever I wanted, no matter if someone was there or not. Now I can't have that anymore (but I perfectly understand why I can't and I'm wouldn't ask it to change!). But my mental health has really gone to shit since. I don't have my safe place (the barn) anymore, I don't have my family (the people who had horses there and the people who worked there) anymore, I dont' have my emotional support anymore, I don't have my personal horse-time anymore. It really was the last thing that helped me stay upright, and now I don't have it anymore. I feel awful, I lost all the progress I had made in my head. All my happiness and support was dependant on this barn and this horse. &amp;#x200B; I feel really really terrible and sad and negative right now, and I know it's partly why I'm so afraid to interact with the girl. I'm craving to have some contact with my horse so much. I miss him, and I want to be alone with him. &amp;#x200B; Can anyone please help me, I'm afraid to ask the girl to come see the horses, I'm afraid of taking too much space and insisting too much. Would it be crossing a line to ask to be alone ? What if she doesn't want me to come ? What if she thinks it's annoying ? Am I too pathetic for feeling so much about a pony ? I certainly feel pathetic. What if my presence is bothering ? &amp;#x200B; I'm just lost, and alone. Can someone help me see the situation with a clearer mind ? "
ps6qkq," Friends telling me i'm looking good on a pic. But i don't believe them.. My friend took a picture of me at the beach and everyone is telling me to post it online because i'm looking good but in my view the photo looks so bad i feel like they're just making of me. In the pic i have a big tummy, my arms look thin as hell even though i work out, and i also have a turtle neck. How can they tell me that shit is good? "
85oalb," I feel like I've been regressing socially. Hey, I'm Steve. 23 M. I'd like to preemptively say that I'm not really sure what I'm expecting by posting here. I graduated college last May in IT and decided to take a year off for some me time because I never did some things I wanted to do and figured it was now or never to live my life before I commit to a career I don't really care about. In this time I've learned some skateboarding and realized (as stupid as this is) that my dream job would be to work for Revive skateboards, even if it's just a warehouse job, but learning to skate has always been a dream. Anyway, I want to email the head of the company and ask if they have any jobs or anything, even wrote up an email, but couldn't hit send. I know the chances are low of getting a response, but I know I'll regret not at least trying and letting it slip away, but I just can't do it. Then there's a girl. I've had Tinder for a while and have around 140 matches. I don't typically talk to my matches because... well... social anxiety. I do every now and then with mixed results. I started talking to this insanely cute girl the other day and said exactly 4 lines to her, then she gave me her number. (It was a joke thing i saw somewhere and wanted to see it worked. It did.) We texted every other day for a few days; I like to message a bit before asking someone out just to get an idea of the person... but also anxiety. I kept wanting to ask her on a date and was thinking she'd say yes because we seemed to click messaging. I just.... couldn't. I keep getting in my head saying I'm probably too boring of a person, she wasn't that interested to begin with, even if I got a date I wouldn't know what to talk about (even though my other first dates in the last few years I feel like I was fine) etc. But the thing is, I've asked out people before. I've been rejected and I've gotten dates. I don't know why I can't just do it this time. But now I feel like I missed the window to ask her out or she's moved on and forgotten about me and that there's no point in trying now. It's just driving me nuts that I can't do this thing that I have done fine before. Then there's my friend who I've known for 10 years. We've had our issues but remained friends for that long. She moved up around me to finish classes after I graduated, but since I'm still here we got close again. The other day I asked to use her student account to print a picture for a tattoo I was getting and she freaked out and said ""or could not only message me when you need something."" I have only ever, and I mean ever, asked for one thing (to help me pick up my new tv because my car was too small). Meanwhile she asks me for help with her computer, tv, homework, etc all the time, which I don't mind at all but what the hell. We got into an argument which ended not-so-well. I know I'm not in the wrong here because, as I said, I've literally never asked her for anything so I don't understand what the heck even happened. This doesn't have much to do with anything, other than just making me feel shitty, and not further not want to talk to people. I also debated posting on /r/makenewfriends just to try to make some new friends or talk to some new people, but again, I just can't hit submit and rationalize it to myself by saying I probably wouldn't get any responses anyway. I don't know if it's depression, the winter blues, or what, but I just can't get out of my head. And it's driving me bonkers not being able to just ask someone out. I feel like I got so, so much better a while ago and now I've completely regressed. Sorry for the long post. Again, I'm not even sure what I'm expecting to come from posting here, but I figured if anyone understood it would be you guys. "
qemkrx," Anxious about tomorrow. Up late anxious and deciding whether to go on this rock climbing trip tomorrow. Most of the university students that are going are going to be younger i assume (or more so fear). I’m 24, and they’re more like around 20. Ofc there may be older students but I feel like it’ll be more so around that younger age range. That’s making me nervous and feel like a lame and idk if I should force myself to go. I’ve always wanted to go rock climbing but I just feel so nervous about this :/ I’m leaning towards no. I’ve been making great progress lately and I hope this doesn’t discourage me "
p7na48," Is this Social anxiety?. So, I've always labeled myself as a shy (and awkward) person around others, but I think it's more than that. I struggle (and ultimately avoid) going outdoors alone (it feels like everyone I pass near is watching and judging me) and making eye contact. I also panick when talking or being with strangers (like the cashier at the supermarket or even relatives I never see) to the point that my mind goes blank (and so everything just becomes more awkward). I've not made friends in years, I just have the same ones from before I developed this ""anxiety"". Do you think it's social anxiety or am I just over reacting (like I've being told several times)? "
5ppw1k," Getting my first job. I leave college in June and after that I will have to get a job. I did have the choice of going to uni where I was going to further study photography or film making but because I live on a island that involves going over sea for every interview etc and the thought of this was just stressing me out. Now I have to get a job but I'm terrified. My mum helped me apply for a job yesterday in a pet shop that's opening but I don't think I want to work in a shop, I'm not to bothered about serving people because I'm fine with strangers but I got pretty good grades in exams at school i feel like I'm capable of more, plus photography and film making are my passions. When it comes to jobs I'm mostly scared of the interviews but not just that. I'm scared of the small things like, not knowing what to do an being scared to ask, phoning in if I'm sick or asking for holiday, being judged because I'm shy, getting something wrong and being embarrassed and feeling stupid. I just fear everything and I can't stop worrying about it. It makes me not want to work where at the same time I just want to be normal. It seems so easy for everyone else. This is causing me serous stress, I feel trapped and want to cry all the time, I can't concentrate on anything and feel anxious constantly. I know I should get help but I don't know how to as I'm only 17. I don't want to tell my family I need help because they don't understand and in the past have not been helpful about my anxiety. "
d7lwcpb,"I second the work out.  When I don't have a regular routine I feel like shit and become very self concious when stepping outside my apartment.  Even just taking the trash out is nerve wracking sometimes.  But working out, maybe it's the endorphins or because I feel more comfortable with my body or both, but it's become less nerve wracking.  I still prefer to stay indoors, but stepping outside for anything has gotten much easier.  nnAlso, I noticed that not having contact with other people sort of amplifies the anxiety because you sort of lose touch with the outside world and become more paranoid.  Well at least I do.  So it's a shitty disorder that feeds on itself.  I found making a list of goals helps out.  Find a recipe you want to make.  Go to the store and buy ingredients.  Want to go for a walk, find a destination and walk there and back.  Just focus on the task at hand and do it and come back.  It made getting used to around random people easier for me.  And the really shitty thing about it is trying to desensitize myself to the anxiety by putting myself in uncomfortable situations like going shopping for a shirt.  I found many times it's really hard for me to do things by myself and it helps if I had a family member or one of my few friends go and do it with me.  It took me over a year to use the bbq grille at my apartment by myself.  But hey, now I can do it and it's fine.  It takes time, but you have to make sure you are making progress as slow as it is."
516cjk,"Flirting ??. hi people of SA !!! I'm pretty new here, and I need some advice... Okay, I am a 17F and I like to go on walks. I started like a month ago, and I really enjoy having that time to myself to just think and breath (I live by the ocean, so beach walks!) Anyways, pretty much every day I go on a walk I get a guy flirting with me or whistling, and I don't really know how to deal with it. Like, I'm not wearing anything provocative, I just want to walk in the sand and look at cute dogs. Idk what to do, please does someone have any advice? Sidenote : if it's a guy I might be into and he's flirting, what should I do? I'm so awkward I never know what to say Thanks !!!"

epzcdk," My Rant: An Insomniacs Plea. I had a life. In school I had friends. In school I was always sociable. After school I would sometimes hang out with my friends. Once I was done with school I felt like all the structure in my life fell apart. Once I got to college, it was all about ME making moves. I had to find out what I LIKED. What I ENJOY. What I WANT TO DO FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. Needless to say I dropped out my second year before finals. It's been two years since I've left my house and I only leave for weekly therapy. I'm on meds for depression and severe anxiety. This sense of impending doom that I can't shake. So many racing thoughts in my head that I feel my eyes twitch like a telegram rapidly spamming SOS through the cable lines. I don't know who I AM. What I am. I'm a fly on the wall. I'm a breeze of wind that just passes you by. I'm nothing to society. I'm nothing and I will just fade away with time. "
92nbi7,"I'm hiding in my room because someone was supposed to come over today. I'm staying at a house we rented on a lake, and my family all went out golfing so I'm the only one home. A previous renter was supposed to come and do something with the bunk bed upstairs because they broke it, and my parents told me they left the door unlocked so they could do it and I wouldn't have to do anything. I haven't heard them come yet, so I've been hiding in my room for the past two hours because I don't want to be out in the house when they get here. I haven't even eaten yet and it's 12:20 because I'm too nervous to even go out to get food, even though I'd just bring it right into my room. At this rate, I'll probably be in my room until my family comes back."
g4j7i0w," That’s up to you. We can’t tell you as social anxiety is different for everyone. You need to think about something small that seems doable, maybe something that’s just a small step up from something you already do. If you’re used to going for a walk make it a goal to say hello to one person your pass for example, or even just smile at them (from behind a suitable face covering of course). Start very small and work your way up. "
c1w0xj," I can't get myself to go out, but I wanna meet new paople and lost a lot of my friends because of social anxiety.. Hey there. So I'm a 16 y/o girl living in Germany. I have Social Anxiety and I am very shy. I've lost many friendships because of me being scared to go outside, or meeting new people. Today I had a good day and went outside with a friend. Bad for me, we went on the ""Erlanger Bergkirchweih"", which is a much smaller version of the ""Oktoberfest"" but in Erlangen and on a mountain. There are MANY people and I got nauseous and scared the first second we went trough the entrance. Luckily my friend introduced me to her boyfriend and two other guys, who were all EXTREMELY nice to me (I didn't tell them about my mental illnesses, they just thought I was shy. one of them even put his arm around me, because some assholes grabbed on my ass and I got even more anxious because of these cunts). One of the other two guys (the one who ""hugged"" me) and I understood each other very well and I want to do something with him sometime. Sadly I'm too scared to go out with him alone. Even though we could do something with some friends now and then, the time will come where I'd like to go out with him alone sometime. We don't have to get together, but becoming good friends would be nice. Only getting to know him won't help much, because I canceled MANY dates with my (now ex-)boyfriend because of social anxiety. It became worse since I've lost many friends in hurtful ways who knew I have Social Anxiety and depressions, which are a result of my anxiety. Can anyone give me tips on how I can relax a bit more and trust new people? Any help is appreciated and thank you so much. Also, if you suffer yourself, I love to talk or chat with you❤️. "
5izdig," I just got back from a party with a girl I like.. So tonight I went to a house party (10-12 people) with this girl I've been friends with for a couple months or so. I started off ""seeing"" her kind of formally. We had dinner a couple times, but she told me she was really just looking for friends. That was fine and we started hanging out and partying with these people from her work. This is the second one I've been to with her and it is so much fun. Anyway I get there and everyones in the basement where all the food/booze is. I find my friend who we will call Sally and make myself a drink. Then the host pulls me aside to smoke a joint outside, because she knows I'm kind of a pot head. At one point we play a game called Rotten Apples or something. (It was dirty apples to apples basically.) I was sitting next to Sally and sometimes when she laughed she would fall into me or touch my leg. That was probably just the the alcohol, but I enjoyed it. Things gradually got more ""interesting"" as the night progressed. It's about 1:00 AM and most of the guests have left. It's just one couple, a super flaming gay guy, me, Sally, and the host. We are all upstairs in this kickass lounge area listening to the gay guy tell a story about rolling on E and going nuts sucking dudes off at some pool. Then the couple and gay dude went downstairs saying they were getting in the hot tub. Me and Sally decided to get in too so she changed into a bikini and I borrowed some trunks. We get downstairs and they were just naked. We stepped aside for a moment and were like ""Are we really doing this?"" I said I was in if she was and so we got in a hot tub with 3 naked people we had just met. It was definitely an experience to say the least. The couple were doing increasingly sexy things to one another when we decided to get out and head home. I can only imagine what went on after we left. I obviously never do anything even remotely like this normally or I wouldn't be posting here. Man is it exciting. I feel so alive when I'm around Sally. I would never be comfortable doing shit like this. I would have GTFO and not looked back. But when we do it together it's fun and exciting. I LOVE just spending time with Sally and being friends, but I do really want more. Also the thought of her being with someone else tears me up inside. She's single, thank God. "
dftfzgb," rejection therapy, -i personally find asking for instructions/directions easier or ordering something, especially when i'm in the city -talking over the phone or voice chat is also easier -talking to older friendly people less intimidating -sometimes on the subway people would be openly talking to each other so i would put some words in and they would be receptive -having a chat with the food vendor -nodding to other runners -talking about video games as that is a more comfortable topic for me with people my age and gender basically in more professional situations like service where communication is more moderated, directions where getting help doesn't involve yourself as a person as much, having something established (like video games or running like other runners) to a channel to communicate through another dynamic to consider, since i find girls more intimidating to talk with, i just ask them questions, like with a pretty retail worker with older people, i find them less intimidating, so i don't use instructions as much a crutch but have a short conversation with them, like the weather, or whatever they be talking about on the subway like news here are videos and a channel on rejection therapy, some of the stuff he does is more drastic, so you gotta remember to start tiny and climb very tiny steps, don't flood! like in my case asking out a girl immediately would be flooding, especially if i try to ask out multiple people. you just gotta do simple and manageable things i would also recommend checking out Stephen Guise's book How to Be an Imperfectionist it emphasizes keeping things simple, and not to fret about details and the like.

ljujfq," How should I tell my dad (who is my coach) that I want to quit playing soccer. I hate soccer, I've been playing it for 8 years now(I'm 15) and I haven't been able to find joy since I started. I'm not even good at soccer, I'm just athletic and have a lot of stamina so I'm one of the best in my team. The problem is, I don't like any aspect of soccer and it feels more like a chore than a fun activity. I don't like my teammates, I don't like my dad/coach, and I just don't like running after a ball for 80 minutes straight. And I already Sport a lot, I like skateboarding, if it doesn't rain I skate atleast 20 hours a week. And now the biggest problem, my family. My dad, uncle and grandpa are gigantic soccer fan. My grandpa watches all my games every weekend(not now ofc because covid-19) and my dad is my coach. It's clear that I don't like soccer, and that I prefer to skate, but I just can't tell my dad I don't like soccer. What should I do? And how? "
s9ou6q,"Ever since I got a haircut I've been feeling more confident. There's been a hairstyle that i wanted for years and i was too afraid to ask for permission from my parents (even after i hit 18) cause i thought they and everyone i know was gonna judge me for it. So one day i decided to grow some balls and ask my mom, but through messaging cause face to face is too scary. I sent her some pics of the hairstyle i wanted, it was a really short haircut for women and i said ""can i get this haircut one day? its ok if you say no"" and she said ""but the girls in these pics have makeup on so it looks good on them, with the way you dress and your glasses you'll look like a boy"" I felt like she was judging and felt overwhelmed so i kinda wanted to end the conversation there and reply with ""thats fine"" but instead i said ""i'll get contact lenses and start dressing better"" and she said ""i'll think about it then"" Later that day she showed the haircut pics to my dad and i felt kinda nervous around them after that, every time they looked at me i felt like they were thinking about how i'm getting more boyish and how much of a dissapointment i am. Few days later the contact lenses we ordered came up and asked my mom if i could get the haircut now. She said ""fine, though you would look better with contact lenses and long hair"" That weekend i got the haircut, i was very happy about it myself but the moment i went out the hairdresser i got very anxious. When i was on my way to the bus station i felt like everyone passing by was judging me. When i got home my parents complimented me but to me deep down they were still judging. Well that was 2 months ago. I feel much better since everyone got used to my hair. I'm a bit more confident now and I dont fear going outside as much anymore. :)"
fa1t30f,"Seriously, presentations are the worst. Knowing your subject matter is 100% it for us. I may be speaking presumptuously but for myself I can't say much in front of a group normally but if someone brings up engineering or baseball I go off for hours and even make folks laugh. It's a smart confidence thing. Imo we're more careful and sensitive of other people's time and care if they don't want to hear it. The thing is if people are there for a specific thing and you know that specific thing. You know they give a shit so imo you'll do well socially if you know it."
oj9vb3,"What can I do to train on my anxiety? I'm desperate at this point. Can't even walk to the store anymore... INFO: I have general anxiety, so it's constant. It's always heavier breathing, my heart can rapid beat out of the blue sometimes, but social anxiety is a huge part of my general anxiety. It stems from bullying, bad friends, family problems, and being transgender. What I've done: I've done so many things to try and help myself. I'm meeting up with therapists (tried like 8 at this point I believe), trying to chat with people online, challenging myself daily to like go outside and sit on the porch, trying to do the opposite of my anxiety. This doesn't work, none of them do. It can work at times, like some days I'll feel kinda good and be able to walk to the store or smth with modest anxiety, but then I'll afterwards fall into this pit where I can't even walk out of the house to sit on my porch without having a panic attack almost. Weed is the only one that works, but only while I'm high, and I'm not going to be high 24/7. I only use it to get a break like every two days or so as of now. End note: WHAT CAN I DO?!? Nothing seems to be working. I got referred to a specialist, but funnily enough, my anxiety is so bad I don't think I'll be able to make it to the specialist today for the first meeting. Any tips is really really appreciated."
e5y7h74,I know what you mean. When I lived in the dorms I would walk around aimlessly for hours listening to music because I couldn't stand to be in a room with another person all of the time. nnI'd definitely recommend going to the library for studying. University libraries usually have some corners and small sections that you might be able to relax in by yourself for a few hours. There may also be some parks in the area where you can find a place to yourself for a bit. 
edawv50,"Im in the same position as you right now, Im 16 with Social Anxiety Disorder and in summer holidays I exercised mainly while running in the roads in the back of my house, I live in the countryside and I had almost got ran over multiple times while jogging.

9r68u1," Education live stream. Hi all, I'm a 15 year old and I was watching an AP European History live stream to study and it was about the Scientific Revolution. We can ask questions in the stream and I asked if there was any pseudoscience in the era like how people in the 19th century make up things like skull sizes of different races. The teacher basically ridiculed the question. In his defense the question was worded poorly but instead of asking me to clarify he pretty much called me dumb for asking the question and now I feel like I should never have even thought of it or tried. Yay. "
e3exn3p,"Sounds like something to get therapy for. It's just simply not true that other people have nothing to offer you, and anxiety just warps everything further.nnYou're still young, now's the time to pick up coping skills that'll serve you well for the rest of your life. The earlier you invest, the longer you'll benefit from the payoff. If your mental garden is overgrown by weeds like warped expectations and beliefs, low self-esteem, a lack of emotional regulation skills, then get to weeding it out and let the proper plants breathe. nnThere's nothing saying you need to become a social butterfly or that there's a simple way to magically become anxiety-free, but it's worth  taking this seriously and working on giving yourself the chance to begin building the sort of social connections that'll increase your quality of life and help you deal with life in general. Even the most introverted, independent, un-fuzzy-feelings person benefits a lot from having other people they can fall back on and relate to, it's just undeniably good for your mental health. Nobody in the world ever figured things out entirely by themselves, at best people 'kind of get by' but that's the best you'll get in isolation.nnYou're not gonna feel this way forever, if you can take the opportunity to have someone point you in the right direction and help you get those spiderwebs out of your brain, then take it. Grab it by the balls, dude. Do it."
omwol5," Embrace Boredom And Emptiness: Creativity Will Come!. During the past week I’ve been on a dopamine fast. As part of this dopamine fast, I’ve eliminated things like social media, digital entertainment, processed foods, etc. As you can probably guess, some of my days have had instances of utter boredom. With that being said, I’m here to tell you something very interesting today; something that has been on my mind for a long time. **BOREDOM IS A GOOD THING!** It’s an absolutely beautiful thing. Let me tell you a story. Yesterday, as part of my dopamine fast, I had a wonderful day: I wrote two articles, I went to the gym and had a great workout, I spent time with friends outdoors, I played basketball, I fasted and ate healthy, I did some reading, etc. It was a day filled with productivity. **Something very odd and interesting happened around 3 pm:** Around that time, I had already done a lot of the things that I had planned to do for the day. I was exhausted. I did not know what to do. I felt very tempted to pick up my phone and watch videos or scroll through social media. I reached a state of utter boredom, and I had no motivation to read, write or do anything else. I also did not have my car with me, as a family member was using it. I had nothing to do! **What did I do?** I embraced the boredom. I rested on my bed, with my eyes open, struggling with the boredom. But you know what? In retrospect, that experience was a beautiful thing. I allowed my mind to rest and waited until creativity came to me. **There was a second moment of boredom that came later at night:** It was around 9 pm and I felt that same emptiness that I had felt before. I had nothing to do, so again, I simply rested on my bed and allowed creativity to come to me at its own time. And it did! I got a great idea for a project that I might work on, and I got a few amazing ideas for articles that I will write in the near future. **We live in a world where we never give ourselves a rest!** Whenever we get even a tiny sensation of boredom, we drown out our thoughts and creativity and indulge in things like TV, video games, social media, etc. **It sucks!** We never allow ourselves to just sit and be bored. We never allow creativity to come to us. All of us are capable of great creativity. It’s part of what makes us human. But in many cases, in order to be creative, we must first be bored; we must first take a step back from all the artificial dopamine that we are constantly indulging in. **Let me end this article by quoting one of my favorite authors and entrepreneurs, MJ DeMarco:** “You soul will resonate its desires or discontent when faced with quiet or minimal distraction; for example, sleeping, showering, or during a massage. How are you responding to your soul's voice? Is it denied? Ignored? Muzzled with the intense demand of meaningless work? Distracted by a television? Honored?” "
fjb8or,"I think i scrubbed everything :/. So i'm 24, theres a man who has his own car wash bussiness in his house, (he looks like 30). I have noticed that whenever i walk over his house when i got for a walk with my dogs, he looks at me. So i always feel anxiety whenver i walk over his house cause i dont want to look at him also and smile. Its just hard for me. I think im autistic too. My social anxiety have been killing me these days! So yesterday, i decided to finally ask him why he look at me. I said, hello. Can i ask u a kestion? And he said: yes sure :) so i started to tell him that this is very embarrassing but this is the only way i will know. So he started to get confused (i was forcing myself to look at him in order to see his reaction cause of my social anxiety). And i told him ive been noticing he looks at me everytime i walk over his house with my dogs and i asked him why? I explained to him i got social anxiety and that i needed to know why cause it was making me overthink a lot. So he said, uhh i just look at you like, ""oh hey, thats the girl who walks with his dogs. And thats it."" and i said ohhh.... Sorry i thought u were thinking im weird or something... And he said, nono nothing like that. God it felt very unconfortable... So i went to walk with my dogs today and he noticed me then he just look at the floor like if i wasbt there and continued working.... Now i feek bad and anxious what he thinks about me. Maybe that im a psycopath... So guys! I wanted to share this This sociak experiment. For you to know. That people are not judging you in their minds. Think they see you cute lol or they see you a nice person. Cause with this, ive figured it out everything is in our minds and its not worth it to live this hell, just practice everyday thinking POSTIVE.... Peace"
t2sprt,"Anxiety turned into borderline agoraphobia. I literally cannot go outside anymore. The mask has helped me through so much and now that the mandate has been lifted i havent left the house.. I opened the shop at work two days ago and my coworker came in smiling to tell me i could finally take my mask off ..i quit on the spot and Walked out having a panic attack . Theres no food in the fridge and i cant even leave to go to the store. Pre covid i was bullied relentless for my appearance.. Im 23 and my so called friends would tell me i look like a young old lady, my cheeks are too fat when i smile, that i look emotionless or have rbf . I was constantly having to explain myself to new people so i didnt scare them away. I was insecure smiling and scared to not smile. I couldnt win . At one point i even tried walking around faking a smile 24/7 and this lady thought i was literally on the spectrum and grabbed my arm to help me find my caregiver at the grocery store..(thats a little funny when i look back on it but at the time i was blown away lol) I cant go back to this way of living though..the peace ive felt in these last two years is unmatched. Last month in preparation of all this i got a few procedures done at the plastic surgeon in hopes that my insecurities would disappear and they havent. I look different definitely, my cheeks aren't as chubby, i dont look as old, my rbf isnt as prominent . But the pain is still there The worry is still there And im stuck in my house."
fq6wbzj," It provides a layer of separation/anonymity, and removes the expectation of talking/deeper interaction. Quality stuff for anxiety, man. I think this could be great for people who want to continue wearing masks for a little longer as a way to make outside trips easier and slowly expose themselves to more social interaction. Lil baby steps, like when my therapist said “Fine, don’t go to the supermarket then. You show up here every week with coffee, but your aunt gets it after driving you, right? Okay great, the coffee shop is tiny. You can start with going in there.” I would’ve loved to have a mask for that and the eventual supermarket trips lol "
dybfrnn," Me too unfortunately. My family has a small house/cabin that would be perfect, but really depends on whether I can find a job there... It's my backup plan if therapy fails, I'd rather fix my SA and live in the city to be honest. "
hjuoo14,"Like they would follow me around. Today they'd walk behind me while we were at the park and I could hear them say my name in a mocking way and talking about me. I felt very uncomfortable but tried to ignore it. I eventually did confront them and they denied it and laughed at me and walked to another spot and a few minutes later they came and sat right in front of me. I knew they were following. And they kept saying why I wanna be friends? I just want to be your friend? We can't be your friends? And asked me why I was so mean when i said I didn't wanna be friends with them. They obviously don't remember 6th grade. Then this one boy suddenly started talking about me...having children? Idk what led to the convo but he suddenly asked what about you having children and becoming a mother? I said I didn't want children and he kept asking me why like it was any of his business. This one boy in particular was so nosy for no reason. They kept saying they wanna come to my house cause were ""friends"" . Most likely mocking me or trying to embarrass me. So they'd keep calling my name. Everytime I walk by I keep hearing my name. They keep laughing and following me. I'm very uncomfortable with it. I don't particularly like them either. One of the boys are pretty much always teasing girls, but the other one seems to only be teasing me. He basically talk to other girls normally. I wonder why he's always making fun and trying to embarrass me....since 6th grade. I'm tired of it. It really doesn't help my anxiety at all."
ewj4e3k," I would be uncomfortable to go to school gym too.. maybe switch to activities outdoors like cycling ? If weather allows. In winter you can do fast walks or hikes. That’s what I do, loving the outdoors year round. "
cz3evqz," Honestly i dont know how i did it I got lucky because I'm attractive and was on the soccer team that made it to state last year when i was in HS. I did do a ton of action steps to really improve myself like traveling, getting a job, seeing professionals, group therapy, exercising, going out, but it wasnt enough for her. My SA/self esteem is still very up and down. If anyone in this sub thinks a GF/BF is the solution to your problems you are so wrong. Being single is a freedom people over look. Mold yourself into your ideal partner first and as corny as this may sound ""everything else will fall into place"" but its the truth. SA is a bitch trust me I feel like ive done a lot to overcome this beast but its still strong might even think of medication again in the future, but i digress. Just dont worry about getting in a relationship work on you seriously listen to me lol. If youre sexually frustrated hook up with someone idk but a relationship might not be the best idea. It's your life though you make the decisions. good luck to you all and to myself :). "
dsrff4y,"Press ups, sit ups, jogging on the spot, and star jumps. Thats my home exercise routine :)nnIm the same as you, dont want to run down the street as i fear people will watch and judge me as i do, and my stamina is shit. The fear of being judged ruins everything. "
8s3jsf," New Challenge Idea! Trying To BEAT/LOWER MY ANXIETY! (I will update as i progress). Hey guys. Firstly, to give you little context of where i'm at in my life and where i want to be. I'm a 21 y/o collage student (IT) from Serbia. I've had my ups and downs regarding social anxiety. Had times where i was happy and flowing, had times where i was stuck in my head 24/7 with a fair dose of OCD and ADD. Secondly, I've tried listening to many self help people (Elliot, Jordan Peterson, Owen Cook Aka. RSDTyler, Leo Gura,..) and they've helped me a little bit, but i've generally stayed the same. No drastic changes. I've read a few self help books like Power Of Now, Power Of Habit, Six Pillars Of Self Esteem,... and i find Power Of Now and Power Of Habit the most interesting/helpful ones, however not life changing for me. Furthermore, i've also tried a lot of challenges ranging from approaching random people on the street, NoFap (120 days), to going to the gym every day. None of them stuck very well. The classic ""i lose motivation and drive after a while"". I have to note that i was feeling my best when I WANTED TO DO THE THINGS THAT I THINK I NEED TO DO! Like working some random challenging job, studying day and night etc. but they never stuck either. I only did it because i ""NEEDED"" to do them at that time! Moreover, i don't want to drop some wisdom and say ""You will find inspiration from your inner being"" or ""You need to do it no matter what"" go hardcore or some other stupid advice. I just found (THIS IS MY VERY SUBJECTIVE, PERSONAL OPINION), that the MORE i go outside, the more i am happy, productive, outgoing, higher self-esteem and the more i stay home and play video games, do nothing, the more i develop crazy thoughts, neurotic behaviors, compulsive drives, OCD, ADD, you name it.... SOOO finally, to revert back to the ""New Challenge Idea"" mark, i've wanted to do a new challenge for me..every time i tried a new challenge i was feeling that somehow that will not help me enough and it will simply NOT stick, AND THEN IT HIT ME! The one thing that i am 1000&amp;#37; positive that will help me A LOT (it has helped me in the past, i just didn't notice/pinpoint it) and that will be my keystone habit (habit that will skyrocket all other positive habits in my life), IS TO GO OUTSIDE EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR 10 HOURS MINIMUM! Just do random stuff, go to collage, go to the gym, go to the pool, visit a friend, go to a party, WHATEVER! I've noticed this in my head because when i get up in the morning, if i don't have any important tasks, i go auto pilot mode and say to myself: Okay so lets start the day and later we can decide if we want to go outside maybe...LIKE WHAT?! I WASN'T LIKE THIS BEFORE! Before, i just went to the pool or something and did some fun/interesting stuff with my friends....JUST NO MORE STAYING HOME WHOLE DAY PLAYING DOTA, FORTNITE OR SOME OTHER USELESS STUFF! **IMPORTANT NOTE!** I think/guess this isn't for everyone as i'm a very big extrovert. I'm happy when i'm outside with people no matter what i'm doing.(here comes a cliche, but a true sentence) In this day and age, it's weird how much we spend our time in our little bubble...Time for US to break that! **TLDR: Challenge: SPEND (Minimum) 10 HOURS OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE EVERY DAY!** I have a check calendar of 35 days. In essence, i will be doing this thing for about 5 weeks...very possibly more and i will see how i feel about it. I just have this feeling that this will help me greatly because every time i did similar things, i was at ease and happy. Depending on the reach of this post, i will update each week of what i'm experiencing. "
5ubgyw,"Tomorrow I may go to a barbecue gathering and I'm stressed out, could really use some motivational words.. My friend said she would call to make plans because tomorrow is a day when we traditionally do barbecue in my country. I thought she would have called by today but it's now 2 am and she hasn't contacted me. I didn't call because I was hoping she would forget inviting me. Now I have to wake up early tomorrow and be ready in case I have to go and I am pretty tense."
dk3k0rq," yes I can relate, you don't want them to see you for what you really are. A tip I would give is to look at their eyes to determine their eye colour....ok, so their eyes are blue....what kind of blue? sea blue, electric blue, dark rings around the iris? have they got big bushy eyebrows or a few little hairs? have they got makeup on them? if not, maybe you could try to imagine makeup on them. Do they have bags or visible veins under their eyes? Do they blink excessively? do you think they have good vision or bad vision? Are they good at keeping eye contact with you? Practice watching youtube tutorials of people speaking and focus on their eyes for practising this technique. (You'll be an eye expert as a weird side effect of your therapy.) It will still hurt you to look but try to divert your attention to little interesting physical details about their eyes and you will find yourself looking at them more than you realised you could. If you become interested in them then you will take some of the pressure off of yourself. I hope this helps. "
tcwmax,"I don't know how I'll be able to take my puppy for a walk after this.... I have a little 7 month old Doxie. My husband and I go for nightly walks because less people are out. As we are walking her a man comes out with his small dog. Thankfully my husband handles small talk and I usually just stand there saying very little. His dog naturally starts to sniff my dogs butt. The guy asks if she's a girl and we say yes. He then says ""That explains it, he hasn't seen one in a while. I heard her barking and came out."" That comment made me a little uncomfortable but so does every social interaction I have. He then says ""pretty soon his red rocket is gonna come out"" my husband awkwardly laughed and said to have a good night. The man begins to walk with us asking what kind is she and how they would make cute puppies. I kinda checked out mentally during that moment and don't know what my husband said to give him the hint to walk the other way. Needless to say I feel extremely uncomfortable right now and am back to being scared to go and walk my dog."
hs1ro8," My life has stagnated because of my social anxiety. I don't feel like an adult at all.. I've been an introvert for much of my life. In my childhood and teenage years I was extremely outgoing, confident and willing to take on new challenges and social situations. I had a good group of friends, would always be out doing something and barely wanted to be home other than to eat, spend time with family and sleep. Going out into social environments scares me now, even simple interactions in the grocery store makes me feel embarrassed. Small talk doesn't come easy. However, once I feel comfortable in a place or with the person I'm talking to, I can do okay and feel normal. I love going outdoors and doing activities when I can, and I can be among people in some conditions. I believe I could be an ambivert, or an [outgoing introvert.](As a young adult, I've had a total shift in mentality and outlook on life. No longer am I the carefree person I once was, overflowing with courage. I have, sad to say, become something of a recluse and I'm not proud of it. I don't have any close friends, no one to lean on for support, no one to laugh with. My family is there but...distant. In a dire emergency I'd have people to support me, and I still do activities with family, but when it comes to personal struggles with depression, anxiety and loneliness they just don't understand or seem like they would talk about it. I don't have anybody to talk about deep, complex or emotional topics with. My family is basically only surface level conversation, but I want to talk about the iceberg of subjects with people, and joke around with friends again. I want to know what it's like to go to the bar among friends and have a truly awesome time, or have a cookout with friends and just feel that elusive happiness. I used to think I was strong and could do it alone, but I now see that I'm not. I have spent so much time in solitude that it is chipping away at my ability to keep going. I've stagnated in life. I don't have a job (all I need is a part-time job right now to begin with), I can't drive, don't own a car, and am crippled by this intense social anxiety. Loneliness and depression are wearing me down, draining my energy and motivation. I have started sleeping in late, dreading the next day. I've been so deeply sad and discouraged these past few months. I came here in the hopes that someone could lend their support or advice and help me rekindle my motivation and joy for life. Going on bike rides and spending time at the beach or nature preserves in my town are some of my only joys right now. I just love the peace of hearing the waves on the shore or birds chirping and nothing else. Back to my difficulties with working. I got into a summer work program and all I have to do is contact places near me and I'm almost guaranteed a part time job this summer. The thought of working, having to be in a new environment, having responsibilities and people watching my every move, is intimidating. I haven't worked since high school and I am now 22. I'm filled with dread about working, even if it's a relaxing place for an introvert. The places I am hoping to get are the library or my local animal shelter where I actually worked before and felt comfortable. I love animals. I just need that push from someone, that support that I don't have from anyone in my life. I just can't do it alone, I feel so overwhelmed by the most basic adult things like working and driving. I don't feel like an adult. I appreciate any advice you guys can lend me. I hope I can get better and get through my anxiety to work this summer. "
cvwcus9,"I was at an event this week for 4 days where we had to live in cabins with ppl from the same institutions from across the country (e.g. live in cabin with complete strangers) and I went like ""Huh?"" and ""what??"" everytime someone asked me anything, and of course they giggled a bit. I also felt very anxious around the two girls I had to live with, to the point where we started out laughing together day 1, then it got really awkward day 2 and they made a remark about it being ""really quiet in here...!"" and day 3 I didn't know what to say at some point and said something that came across as rude or something, and then it felt like they stopped having eye contact with me. Needless to say, it went the way it always goes, and the only positive thing I can say, which is also quite depressing is, I'm not really hurt as much as I'm too desensitized to really feel let down after this. It just confirms that improving seems near-impossible."
d8alpb," I feel like the shell of a person. Sorry for the very long post. I (21M) can do some things ok, I just finished at a decent uni and got a decent grade. But when it comes to interacting with people I am totally useless. I mess up my words, speak unclearly, miss things people say, forget stuff that I was just told, act incompetently when under pressure and get confused very easily. Is it possible to get into and finish university (History BA) while being intellectually disabled? I guess it's possible. Maybe that's the root of my SA. Dyslexia is also common in my family, verbal expression is an issue for me as well as spelling and grammar. I have just got my first job at 21, it's so late because my anxiety has made going out and finding one difficult. On the advice of a psychologist I went for a job where I would be interacting with people a lot in order to help with my SA, so I started casual work at a golf club bar/restaurant. But I think the reason I have this anxiety is because of how much I mess things up. Other people just seem to be able to interact almost seamlessly, they joke (I don't really have a sense of humour), fully understanding each other, speaking clearly without occasionally totally tripping over their words like I do. I feel like I am missing that part of me that can connect with people. I just don't know how to even though I want to, I come off as weird, boring and incredibly awkward. It's so lonely. I also fit the criteria for what some people describe as wet blankets or wimps. Also even if I don't know if I'm 'not all there', or whatever term you call it. I think other people do assume I have those kind of issues. My older brother has told me when I was younger I have 'a little something' (mind you he is a narcissist and thinks he is smarter than literally everyone). But, there are also lots of other suggestions other people see me like this. For example, the till was 9 pounds short at the end of the day yesterday (almost definitely on account of my incompetence), and because the people I work with are nice people they tried to trick me into thinking they had found a missing receipt that made up the difference. When it was very clear the issue was to do with the cash (receipts are only kept for card payments) as they had said it was cash earlier and they left 9 pound missing on the board. Also the receipt they found was for 20 odd quid ahaha (which was even mentioned when they found it). They must really think I am totally not there. It makes me wonder how much I am lied to in order to make me feel better and don't pick it up. I don't know what to do, people hate incompetent or stupid people because they make their lives harder. I feel like that may be the underlying thing causing my anxiety. (Although to anyone reading it should be noted underlying intellectual problems causing SA is often not the case). My looks also don't help with the way I'm seen. I just feel like if I'm totally incompetent and can't connect with anyone then I am always going to be miserable. That's not pessimistic, it's just reality. If I could leave that would be fine with me but I can't because it would hurt my family and friends (much more family tho). I don't know what to do about this. I'm not sure there is a lot I can do if I'm right. Thanks for reading "
gxz5de,"Avoiding to try and talk to my crush because he has a lot of friends and is really social.. So I have a crush on this boy from my high school and he is from a class that is next to the one I am in. I really like him but he is really social, has a lot of friends and he's pretty popular. If I were to ever confess (again, will never happen) I don't think I'd be able to go through with it, since I have social anxiety, if we would be in a relationship, I don't think his friends would like me since I am awkward around new people and even come off as rude :( and wouldn't really hang out... He is also really gorgeous and the girls from his class and the other girls he is friend with are also drop dead gorgeous so like do I even have a chance to begin with lmao? If you are not interested in hearing about our little interactions that made me like him, then you can stop reading. But I just want to tell them to someone since I can't seem to open up to anyone in real life about who I like. Before the quarantine, when we were at school his class would have an hour in ours so we'd have to wait in the hallway for them to get out (it'd be on Tuesday) and we'd always have eye contact. Sometimes it would be pretty embarrassing because he would stare until he passed me (I'd usually look away too embarrassed to maintain eye contact) or once we got in the class and he was still there getting his things and I could feel him looking at me (I automatically put on my rbf on and act like I was in a bad mood. God knows why I do this shit...). Also, I was in front of the building, in our school's courtyard with 2 classmates and they wanted me to go with them to see I don't know what guy lmao and I said no thanks, I don't want to be late so after saying goodbye I turned around and he was with 2 other friends of his and I, again, could feel him looking at me and I think I even saw him looking at me. One time, I was going to another building with some classmates(my high school has 4 or 5 buildings) and he passed with his groups of friends and we looked at each other and then he looked at my thighs as he was passing by. Maybe it wasn't that serious but he is my first crush so I freaking blushed. When me and my deskmate decided to go to the store, he held the door open for me and my friend (it was such a nice thing especially since he waited like 5 seconds for us to reach the door and he could have just continued walking) my friend got out first and thanked him and I muttered a thank you, not even sure if he heard it uff I only talked to him once BEFORE all of the things I said previously. When the school started (I was a freshman, same as him but we were both new to the school) and there's this bathroom where both boys and girls go (the bathroom is for the girls but since the other one is closed, boys go to that one as well sometimes) and I was waiting for my classmate to get out and he stepped inside the room while a girl passed by him. He laughed, turned to me and said,, Is this for both girls and boys "" and SOMEHOW I had the guts to say,, I don't know, it seems so"" while also laughing but right then my friend got out and we left. I have been trying to ignore my feelings since I won't ever confess and nothing will happen between us but is nice at lest to dream, right? If you want, you can also tell me about your story. I am bored all day so 🤷🏻‍♀️"
fncrtzo,"YES. Especially when I was having a solo vacation in Korea. 99.9% of cars in Korea are tinted extremely dark so whenever I was out walking on the streets, I felt like the people inside the cars were all watching me. It was terrible."
etsjf0e,"Well, we've been together 7 years but for the first 3 he went to college in a different state and we just saw each other on weekends. So that built up a lot of tension and once we moved in together, it felt like the best thing ever. Maybe being apart initially helped us somehow. But honestly no, if I was ever bored it was from being stuck in a rut in general and just needing to do something new/exciting. Sometimes we blame our relationship/the person we're with for our boredom (I'm guilty :D) but need to take more personal responsibility for our own entertainment. You should go on a trip together. We only recently started traveling and have so much fun, seeing new things together definitely freshens things up. If you guys like taking walks, hiking, nature, amazing scenery etc. go hit a national park. We went to Zion NP in April and it was awesome. Neither of us ever saw a desert climate, cactuses, or canyons before so we were just ooing and aahing at everything like kids and having the best time. Explore this crazy world together!!"
gwt89g,"Any of You Struggling with ""Let's Grab Something to Drink"" Phobia On First Date?. How do you guys manage to act not nervous and awkward on the first date? I have been talking to a guy I matched on bumble for 6 months and plan to meet one day in his city. I really want him to like me but the No.1 concern I have is my weird social anxiety. Whenever a guy invites me to a social settings (ex: restaurant, grocery store, coffee shop) where I have to interact with a third person I freak out. I know it is so weird of me but it really bothers me a lot. I sweat and blush, sometimes stumble over my words when I need to order something/talk to a cashier. I get rather uncomfortable when my date is watching me interacting with others and notice that I'm nervous and awkward. Normally girls would feel happy when a guy says"" let's grab something to drink"", but I always freak out and don't know what to do. I feel ashamed to talk to a guy I have crush on about this because I do not want them to think less of me or find me abnormal. I have always had my first date in a park/his place so I can avoid dealing with the problem, but eventually I would have to go to grocery store/restaurant with my date right? Is any of you struggling with the same thing or just me? Any advice and tip would be greatly appreciated."
fs53q9f, Well lockdown is over where I live so I made myself go skating because everyone would stare at me and I realized no one gives a f about me 
eojcuj3,"It’s definitely possible, but it’s on you to make it happen. While I did have a friend group in HS, I always felt like a peripheral friend and also felt very unfulfilled in my social life. Whether this was actually true or just my SA warping my thoughts, I’m not really sure, but that’s the way I felt. So I was excited (but still nervous) to get off to a new start in college. Unfortunately, things got worse for me. Im not friendless, but I have less friends than I did in HS, am lonelier than ever, and it seeped into my academic performance. My major mistake was expecting everything to be handed to me socially. Expecting things to change just because I changed my environment. You can’t have that mentality, you have to force the change and initiate things yourself. The general advice, like joining clubs, IM teams, etc. is not enough. You must not only join, but be active in those pursuits. For example, I joined an IM soccer team my first year. But I only went and played in the games, I didn’t really talk to my teammates much, participate much in group chats, etc. Same situation for the clubs I joined. I totally repressed my personality and was way too uptight. Just being present wasn’t enough to overcome this. It wasn’t just my first year either, this lasted for like 3-4 years. Part of it may have been the fact that I still had some HS friends in college, so I used them as a crutch, but most of it is just me giving in to my anxieties and inhibitions. Joining things is a good starting point, but to really make something out of joining you have to fight your instinct to avoid/close up and make the effort to engage with others. So that’s the main thing, being active in seeking out social opportunities rather than sticking to the default passivity that afflicts most people with SA. The good thing is, college is a good time to do this, as people are very open to meeting others, especially at the beginning. You can still do it at later times, but it’s just a little harder. Also important: don’t put pressure on yourself. Easier said than done, but something to keep in mind. People can kind of sense that desperation and it can be a turn off. Hell, it’s even a turn off to me and I’m someone who still does this myself. I think a great way to do this is to fill your time with worthwhile hobbies that make you happy even when you’re alone. That way, you’ll have a more positive mindset that will be more likely to shine through in social situations. Anyways, good luck to you once school starts."
fvfjwgn, Anxiety doesn't need to be a secret. I have a similar issue. I've learned not to hide it. Think of it like going out on a boat with someone and NOT telling them you can't swim. Nobody wants to drown. Nobody wants you to drown. Be open.

qz2cd0," Just want to vent. Not really a social anxiety thing, but I was supposed to be going to the rock climbing society today and was looking forward to it, but unfortunately didn’t time my tasks during the day very well and ended up not being able to go. I know it’s stupid thing but I feel like I often end up missing out on things because of stuff like this. It’s a couple days now to my next social thing and I don’t think I‘lol really see anyone before then. Now I’m just sat in my room feeling down… "
qko9ai, Almost caused an accident because of SA. The street i live in is really busy. When i was about to get out of my house with my motorcycle the neighbor's entire family was outside and they were all looking me go out. That made me really nervous and at one point i just went into the street without being sure if i was safe to go. There was another bike coming my way and the guy had a hell of scare when he saw me. I literally saw his eyes popping. Fortunately it was just a scare and nothing really happened. But i still feel so embarrassed. I could have gotten both of us hurt just because i couldn't calm down. Moments like these that makes feel like i shouldn't be living among other people.

hzemo8,"I posted this in r/anxiety but I wanted to post it here too. Does anyone relate to this?. This is my first time posting here. And I'm really nervous to - it feels like I'm not anxious enough about anything to post here. Anyway, I'm pretty sure I have anxiety, specifically social anxiety or something along those lines, and I was wondering if anyone here relates to this. It feels like a weird nervousness following me everywhere. It isn't intense all the time but it never really goes away. It's that eerie feeling that you're being watched. All the time. Even when I'm alone I worry that there's someone in the room with me or that people are watching me through the walls. Or that there are cameras on things watching and listening. I hate making too much noise in case anybody hears me. I don't like wearing certain types of clothing in case people judge me for it (I was given a nice coat by one of my neighbours and I *hate* wearing it. I don't stand too close to people (this was before COVID) in case anyone assumes anything. I don't like smiling in public, I don't like going outside now. I don't even like writing this in case anyone goes on to my profile and finds I've already talked about this on [r/AskReddit](I have deeper fears sometimes too. That last for a lot longer. I used to be afraid of self-harm, constantly worrying that everything I was doing could be self-harm. More recently I've become more depressed and now I have a fear of becoming suicidal. I worry about things that might not happen for years, or that might not happen at all - like the idea of going on medication for anxiety/depression. It was a family member's 30th birthday and I was invited for the party/family gathering. I almost had an anxiety attack on the way there. I also worry that I'm just overreacting to everything or being overly dramatic about this. I'm only 12 and it feels like I'm too young to have anxiety/depression. I also really don't want to tell family about all this because I feel like they won't take it seriously or that knowing their 12 year old son thinks he has anxiety and depression will just bring them down with me. Does anyone relate to this?"
ouzvq1,"How do you accept the fact that you might be alone for the rest of your life?. I have no friends or family other than my parents and sibling. At times I genuinely like being alone and not having to worry about interacting with people, but other times it can get very lonely. I went to the park today and sat there all alone watching people have fun. Usually I like sitting in silence and just observing but today just felt very lonely. At first there weren’t many people there, just a few middle schoolers playing basketball. Then as it got later more and more kids joined and they were all having fun and it was just sad to think how when I was younger I wished to be those kids having something to do with my friends afterschool or in the summer. Except I was the kid who hated summer break because all I did was sit at home in boredom because I had no friends. I would tell myself when I get older I will go everywhere and make more friends and have so much fun but nope. I am currently 21, I can’t even order a coffee without feeling like I am going to have a heart attack. I always told myself things will get better as I get older but I honestly feel like everythings getting worse. I do have a few friends but they either live far from me or only talk to me when they are sad, not when they actually want to have fun. When I try hanging out with them I just feel so out of place and awkward that I tell myself I rather be alone. Im not sure how to make new friends either and yeah I am not sure what the purpose of this post is but I hope some of you can relate. Well actually thats cruel, i hope none of u can relate ;)"
ek8q00f," Im the same bro, whenever I walk outside or walk into a store I have the same thoughts. Regarding socializing some days I feel more confident in my way talking to people, but that varies over time and also depends on what Im talking bout. Often, if its something about me and my life I feel really awkward since i think Im a loser. Those moments I stutter and get real awkward expressing myself. When the topic is about school or something regarding a course im taking, I can talk with more ease. "
f7b5522,"You aren't a shitty friend. I do the exact same thing. I've known most of my friends since I was 5-10 years old (I'm almost 21 now), but making plans and hanging out with them still makes me feel anxious as hell. I recap and overthink all my movements and words in my mind when I'm around them to make sure I didn't sound or look stupid, even though they are basically family and we've done stupid shit in front of eachother all the time and just laugh it off. Unfortunately I, one with SA, cannot just 'laugh it off'. Half the time I just sit awkwardly because I am afraid of expressing my opinion even when I disagree with one of them. Anyway, they want to hangout all the time and many times I have no motivation or energy to do it or want to avoid situations that make me feel anxious. I also am physically and mentally exhausted after hanging out or going to some social event and I feel relieved when I get home, and yes the 'recharge' phenomenon is very real and normal for ppl with SA. I spent a full weekend at my friends lake house this summer and it took days for me to recover. People like us enjoy being alone. Honestly, it might help you if you hang out with your friends more. Countless times I would only go hangout because I was worried they'd talk about me behind my back if I didn't, or would get mad at me. That was the case at first, but now I am trying to have as much social interaction as I can and doing anything I can to enjoy myself, and although my SA hasn't improved much, getting used to all the socializing will eventually make you more comfortable and making plans will be easier. We're young for only so long. It flies by. Don't let anxiety ruin it."

pbbit0,"I'm mad at myself, my college classes started on Monday but I haven't been going bc im too scared. Hi so I'm 21F and I am considered a freshman since I've never been to college before and tbh it scares me. I think bc back in junior year of high school we took a tour around the college (I am currently going to  and graduated high school from) bc we were visiting for an astronomy thing but there was just...so many people, I felt overwhelmed and like everyone was staring at me idk I just felt uncomfortable. Now here I am, having immense anxiety just thinking about walking around the campus to get to my classes, talking to people etc. I can't even go anyway bc I dont have a parking permit  and I dont want to get a citation. But I also REALLY REALLY do want to go and learn about art (I'm majoring in Visual Arts) I want to earn my bachelors degree and have a career in Art. It's just im too freaking nervous and scared I always psych myself out! ugh...any tips from people who have already been to college?"
ddo3abp,"Something that really helped me was giving myself some alone time. Now I know what your thinking, you've probably got more alone time than you know what to do with, but how often do you use that time to actively improve yourself?nnAt my lowest point I couldn't even look passer-bys in the face, so I made it a point to go for a walk everyday and smile and nod to almost anyone that I passed. Eventually I worked up to the point where I would actually say hi to them, and because of that I now have a customer service job that I feel comfortable with (for the most part anyway).nnIt's kind of strange isn't it? Having your SA worsen over time, you'd think it would do the opposite. But like almost anything, socializing is a skill, and like all skills you have to work on them to strengthen them. I've still got a long way to go, and at the moment I've been somewhat complacent on my progress which eats away at me. nnLong story short immersion is a great tool you can use to better yourself, most therapists will say that exposure therapy for any phobia is what can lead to the best results. Stay true to yourself and be open to the possibility of change!"
fispur9,"I’m in the exact same boat, except I’m 23. The thing that has helped me over the past 3-4 years is just finding things I enjoy doing alone at home. Movies, tv shows, video games, books, gardening, playing with my animals, drawing, etc. If you want to find friends and try to live a “functioning” life you might have to try therapy but I couldn’t do that. Being 19 and dealing with all of this is hard but as you get older you will find things that matter to you and make you happy. Good luck to you!"
oxe664," My idea on how to better self esteem and therefore lessen social anxiety. To better self esteem and beat anxiety you gotta analyze your traumas ,fears ,insecurities and THOUGHTS and ask yourself these questions. when exactly do i get anxious ? and then what thoughts are running through my head at the moment? Is it an insecurity? If so what type? Is it because of self image? Is it my face?ears?height?Or social class? Or what? Etc. Then you gotta challenge that thought. And think of someone Kindof who looks like u somewhat, who has kindof the traits your insecure about,who does not feel ashamed or insecure about them and doesn’t have social anxiety or self esteem issues. Example. “Well I feel insecure about how my nose looks. It’s ugly. And I’m kinda short too. so I’m not good enough. And I fear people noticing this in public.” Then think: “But wait, I know that guy John Williams who lives a couple streets down who has an ugly nose, and is kindof short but has great self esteem , no social anxiety, is strong, courageous,cool and is a content person!” “ so maybe nothing is wrong with how I look, nor who I am, it’s just my THOUGHTS that are wrong, because they make me feel ashamed when I don’t really have to be! Just like John Jackson is not ashamed! I wonder what THOUGHTS he has about himself that make him have self esteem and not shame?” When I refer to these thoughts I mean thoughts about ourselves, others, looks, mindset, courage, bravery,life,etc. And that is exactly where I’m at now, I’m trying to figure out what THOUGHTS run through the heads of people who are similar to me in size,looks, and status who do not have self esteem issues, nor social anxiety and I’m trying to see where they get their self esteem and fearlessness from. I do this by just observing and trying to figure them out, reading books, watching rap videos and lyrics, rapper interviews, martial artists, martial artist interviews, manly movies and anywhere that I think of where I can get some insights,ideas,realizations and mindsets from manly self esteem guys ugly,handsome,short,tall,rich,poor,good or bad all kinds of guys where I can think I can get some good insights from, and see what Thoughts they think to have self esteem. (Of course apart from this if you are too skinny eat some more protein and workout to get in shape. And if you are too fat, eat less food, eat less crappy food,run,workout and get in shape.) AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, if you got trauma, work on that b****. There’s a lot of GREAT videos on YouTube about many particular forms of trauma and on how to work on it and heal. Also books. And if you got enough money or health insurance choose a good therapist and seeing them can also help. Good look dawgs and I hope this is even somewhat helpful to at least one person. I wish strength and fortitude be with you all. "
fv6hf04," I get a decent amount of sunlight outside at work everyday, I don’t know what I’d write about, I did enjoy creative writing in school a lot so I guess I could mess with something like that. I live with my grandpa and dad, we already have a dog so a puppy probably wouldn’t be a good idea for me sadly. "
kege1b,"I Have My First, First Date Tomorrow. Help Me. So we have been talking since the start of November but because of UK lockdown v2.0, we weren't able to see each other for a while. Since it ended i have tried to arrange to meet her twice but she has cancelled because of her ptsd. It's more of like an anxiety thing for her i guess rather than it being anything against me. We have called twice, 4 days ago for 4 hours and 3 days ago for an hour. She originally said after the first time she cancelled, she wanted to video call first (i have bad anxiety about video calling anyone other than my 3 best friends, but i am getting better at normal calls, so we did that) and she wanted to meet me with one of her friends (who are all guys) present. Which i was pretty uncomfortable about tbh. I get why she wanted to bring a friend, but yeah bringing another guy would make me feel pretty weird. Then 2 nights ago i was meant to go for dinner with her and her younger sister. She said she felt awkward about asking her sister and her sister is really shy. Tbh i get it, its there sister night out, i felt a bit weird intruding. But now she has told her parents about me. We are both off work tomorrow so i asked if she wanted to do something. She said she'd like to go out for a walk (basically what we were gonna do first time around). I said yeah sure, but i was gonna suggest meeting in the city centre in public and just hanging out (because of what she said the first time). But she said she was happy going out for a walk and lunch somewhere. We know where each other live. She said if I kill her then her family will kill me. And i said that was good to know 😂 She was going to drive herself but she can't drive on the motorway coz she a bad driver lol so her dad told her to get me to pick her up. Maybe he just wants me to come so he can tell me he will kill me if i hurt her. And tbh that's fine, she's been through enough and that would just be her father being cautious i guess 😂 we'll see, i doubt he will say that. So yeah we are having a day out at this town that's next to this nice lake (actually the lake in star wars episode 7 woohoo). I'm super anxious. My anxiety medications ran out the other day. So I'm on my own and really really nervous. Cancelling is not an option. Any tips? Im 22 and she 19. She's had a few relationships like 2 maybe 3. I've had.... let me count.... none. Not in any capacity that counts anyway. I never kissed a girl tht i like and not being drunk. And i never had sex (not that i expect or would even want that to happen), by choice, but not by choice, as in i was too anxious to go through with it 😂 so cringe i know. I know I'm thinking way ahead but saves me asking in the future i guess. Though I'm sure i will."
enxub24," I usually attend them even during an activity, playing pool , swimming or simple talking and eating I get the feeling of being disliked and then feeling of “being alone could be better “ at the same time makes it worse to attend in the future as it seems a suffering then practice . "
ebkf9cw,"Dont say youve given up on life. Im gonna give you advice but it is so crazy but just hear me out. I usedto be very socially awkward, not extreme just very uncomfortable no eye contact hard time in groups bigger than 3. But overcome it. What you should do. Overweight? I went to the gym and felt like a god. Bad hairstyle? I changed barbers to a spanish barber and it changed my look and I cant believe i didnt do it earlier. Lacking friends or a relationship? I improved myself tenfold, better life choices made me happier than ever. Get up and leave. Im going to leave the US and go backpacking for a while after classes end. Meet new random people who have no idea how socially anxious it was back home. You will learn so much out there. Trust me please dont give up. Socially isolated doesnt have to mean youve given up. I love being alone even after conquering my demons. Hang in there you got this!"
oaimad,"10 Ways To Improve Your Emotional Health And Your Social Anxiety. Improving your emotional health will help you with your social anxiety. Most of the problems that we face in our lives is due to our poor emotional management skills. Growing up I struggled with understanding my emotions and with expressing them in healthy ways. Some difficult life circumstances led me to repress my emotions. As I will explain in this article, repression is an unhealthy defense mechanism. When I finally got the courage to express myself, I experienced the opposite problem; I would get overly emotional. Finding a healthy medium between repression and emotional explosion is crucial to one’s well-being. Here are 10 ways to improve your emotional health. **1)** **Understand that all emotions are equal.** One of the unfortunate things about the way most of us view emotions is the emphasis we face on happiness and the dismissiveness we show towards other important emotions. All emotions are equally important, and we must treat them with care and respect. Fear is our intuition; it lets us know when are in danger. Anger allows us to set boundaries. Sadness lets us release things that are no longer working for us. Shame allows us to restore integrity. “The Language of Emotions” is a great book that talks about this topic in depth. **2)** **Do not chase happiness.** Happiness is a fantastic emotion. When you are happy, content and feeling joyful about life, you feel like you’re on top of the world. With that being said, happiness should not be chased. You should allow happiness to come and go as it pleases, just as you would with any of your other emotions. Chasing happiness and putting it on a pedestal will ironically lead to unhappiness. Don’t force things. Happiness should come as a by-product of a life well-lived. As it is explained in the book “Flow”, happiness sometimes comes during the flow of things, for example when you are in the middle of working on a project that you are passionate about **3)** **Do not argue with irrational people.** There is little that will diminish your quality of life more than arguing with toxic and irrational people who will bring you down. As a healthy person, you want to live life with calm and centered energy. Furthermore, you want to understand that time is your most valuable resource. Why waste your time on people who aren’t worth it? Why get involved in drama? It’s pointless. It will ruin your mood, ruin your good vibes, ruin your energy, and make you overly emotional about things that don’t matter in the grand scheme of life. **4)** **Become healthy in other areas of life as well.** Becoming physically and socially healthy will help you become more emotionally healthy. The human body and mind are interconnected. Exercise, for example, positively impacts serotonin levels in your brain. The same can be said about a lot of healthy practices, such as eating well, sleeping well, socializing, etc. Being healthy will boost your mood and improve your emotional well-being. **5)** **Do not repress your emotions.** Bottling up your emotions will never end well. Not only will you not develop the skills it takes to understand your emotions and to communicate clearly and effectively, but you will also suffer with physical and psychological health problems over time. Expressing your emotions in healthy ways might not always be easy. Take it one little step at a time and get some help if you need it. When you feel a certain emotion, do not push it to the side; stick with it until it passes naturally. **6)** **Do not get overly emotional.** Rather than having an emotional outburst and embarrassing yourself, learn how to express yourself in healthy ways. This might be the act of talking to someone who has hurt you and letting them know in respectful terms how it made you feel. It might be the practice of going to the gym and letting off steam. It might be the act of journaling and writing about your thoughts and emotions when you are feeling overly emotional. Whatever your method, it’s important to express yourself and to let off steam in a way that is healthy and socially acceptable. **7)** **Minimize stress.** Whether it’s hustle culture, toxic positivity, or social media, we live in a world that is filled with unnecessary stress. Our brains and bodies have not changed much in thousands of years. However, technology and culture have changed drastically in the last few decades. Our brains sometimes struggle in dealing with the fast-paced technology-driven world of the 21st century. It’s important to try to minimize stress as much as you can. Take a break from your phone. Go outside. Have fun with your friends and loved ones. Go on a hike. Get some fresh air. Whatever you do, take time to disconnect and to enjoy life. **8)** **Live for yourself, not for others.** Learn how to say “no”. Every day we are faced with thousands of decisions. Make sure that you are choosing what is best for you and what is best for your emotional health. Do not allow external forces to dictate and influence your life and your decisions. These external forces include parents, school, society, teachers, etc. At the end of the day, the only person that knows what’s best for you is you. Listen to your inner voice. **9)** **Be mindful of the present moment.** A lot of us spend the majority of our days either dwelling about the past, stressing about the future, or indulging in escapism. We escape reality because we are afraid of confronting it. The reason some people play video games, watch Netflix, scroll social media, do drugs, and drink alcohol is because they want to escape reality. Stop escaping reality. Come to terms with your past, minimize worry about your future, and stay mindful of this present moment. What can you do right now to make yourself smile? What can you do right now to improve your life? **10)** **Get help if you need it.** Sometimes, all of the steps above won’t help you to the degree that you want because you are in need of external help. There is nothing wrong with this. Sometimes life gets so bad that you can’t do it all yourself. Get a therapist if you can. Contact friends and tell them that you need them. Utilize some of the other services that are out there for people who need help. **Final thoughts.** I’m not an expert when it comes to emotional health; not even close. This article is simply a collection of my thoughts, observations, and experiences. I’m sure that in the years to come, much of my thinking will improve, as is usually the case with the passing of time. With that being said, I hope that some of you found some these ideas helpful. Best of luck!"
euun4ol," Amazing work dude. That's how you get over your social anxiety, but exposing yourself to such situations. I had a similar experience a few months ago where I talked to this Japanese tourist that I had met at a park and asked out. "
czw8u2," Some advice. Ask yourself, why am I really anxious? Why does it matter what people think of me? The truth is that this is your life and yours only. There is no shame in embracing who are and stepping out into the world, cause everyone is in this thing together. It doesn't matter what people think of you because their thoughts about you shouldn't and don't affect your life. Having anxiety can often make someone judging or staring at you feel the same as having a gun held to your head. In truth, everyone has their own thoughts, looks different and has their own opinions. So why should you have to suppress yourseld at the will of others who are just as human as you? Being judged by others doesn't actually affect your life, you just perceive it that way. Trying to be a people pleaser or being scared of others judgement will only lead you to continually seeking validation externally. In reality, you and how you feel about yourself is all that matters. I therapist recently gave me a helpful analogy: You have to treat life as a playground rather than a high wire. On a playground, the decisions you make don't have real implications and there is room for mistakes, but also enjoyment. Having anxiety is like living life on a hire wire. You tread carefully and over analyse every decision you make, leaving no room to actually enjoy life. Just do you. Cause that's all that matters! "
dk97m7e,You are overreacting thats just how the man talks he wasnt calling you stupid  or anything like that he was just telling you some info on the plants you were getting i feel alot of people in this sub believe that everyone else in the world is just suppose to know we have SA. Just go back and get the plants and if you see that guy again make a joke about how you're back at the store again and your interest in gardening  and what plants are good for beginners. People in this sub need to realize people have different  personalities  the guy was being freidnly I've met people like that 
etljgy6," could try going outside since you have a laptop or even a smartphone to read pdfs or text documents on, or directly from the web. maybe buy a cheap hammock and find a park to set up in? mornings and nights aren't too busy, but i know the feeling of wanting to be alone and not being able to. living with my parents sucks for that reason, there's no privacy or feeling of freedom and independence. "
ewx8l5q," Hmmm. Do they force you to stay in the cafeteria or can you go outside? If they let you go outside, just look for a bench or something and just listen to music or watch YouTube vids. If you have a laptop, it makes it look like you’re studying and no one is gonna look at you weird. "
mvei5w,"Standing up straight and looking at people. Today I felt pretty anxious in the morning. When I left the house I just did not feel right. I am a pretty anxious guy, but today I just felt twice as weak and pathetic as usual. My chest also felt really tight and I had trouble breathing. After about 15 minutes of walking I realised that I was completely hunched over. First I pushed my stomach and my chest out and I felt a big difference. Then I decided to ""make myself taller"" if you know what I mean. I could breathe again and felt pretty good. I have the problem that I become self conciouss pretty easily and walking like that made it even worse. So I decided to look and people and cars and look really long at them. I kind of made a rule that I look exactly at what I don't feel like looking at. It worked great. I have tried some things out recently how to do better in public. Today I had the most success yet. It felt great. I am worried that it is obvious that I actively think about walking straight, but at the same time I know that it is the right thing to do. You can't really blame someone trying to become a man. So yeah, I am now gonna practise standing up straight while looking at people everyday and see how I feel in a month. Since it worked so good today I am extremely motivated to make that shit work."
et8zwat," Was just reminded of this since we’re off to Six Flags soon and I dread everything but the drive back home. Shits unreal. And that’s because my anxiety isn’t so bad that I can’t go to the theater by myself, restaurant, or the park to play ball. But just being around a lot of people for a prolonged amount of time feelsbadman. Wish me luck. Hopefully I can get more enjoyment in the moment instead of the photos I view after the fact.. :/ "
scf207,"I'm a shy musician - I have no problem playing for strangers but will do anything in my power to stop people I know watching me. Is this a thing?. As the title says. I can gladly go to the park with my guitar and play for 4 hours for strangers walking by accepting tips etc. I can play onstage with some friends no problem. But if family/friends want to watch then it's a HARD no and total shut down from me. When I was in highschool me and some friends had a band and did a song in a talent show. I did everything in my power to make sure my mom and grandmother did not get to see it - I even told them the time to come was AFTER the show was over. My mom showed up and called me despicable. Yea, she was probably right, but I couldn't bear her and my grandmother being in that crowd and then having to hear about the show and all that from them afterwards. For years I've tried to explain it like this - Playing music is like writing in a journal for me. If people I don't know hear me play/read this ""journal"", it doesn't bother me because they don't know me and therefore it doesn't affect me. But if your parent read your journal....see where I'm going with this? I know this is weird and crazy but 10 years later I'm still exactly the same. Not really looking for advice, I was just thinking and it all came back to me."
i63rtu," I do not function. I am 20 years old and suffer from depression and social anxiety. There are times when my symptoms are better and times when they are worse. Right now it is returning to the point where my cognition and body don‘t function. When I lay in bed to sleep my mind doesn‘t find anything to think about, I can‘t be creative at all, I’m just not able to think in any way. Also in social situations and conversations I‘m not finding anything to talk about. I feel very dumb in times like this and my memory and focus is zero. Then there is the physiological part that every little move even moving my hand and the smallest tasks, showering, brushing teeth, making food, waking up are just a huge torture. I don‘t have any drive at the moment, nothing interests or stimulates me. Nothing makes me smile, laugh or happy. Other get interested about something or say oh look how pretty that is and I‘m just numb af and don‘t think or feel anything at all. Everything seems so boring and everything seems so hard to do for my mind and my body. I don‘t know what to do. I‘m on 600mg moclobemide right now and hoping for the best improvement but now nothing changed except that I‘m more emotionally numb. I tried all SS(N)RIs, that‘s why now we started my first MAOI. I also had 3 depth psychological therapies and they didn‘t do anything or even worsened my symptoms. Next month I‘m going to start a behavioral therapy. What can I do? I abused alcohol, nicotine, kratom and phenibut for getting off this depression, anxiety and this „boredness“ and negative thoughts in life. But I want to stay off substances except for maybe one prescribed pharmaceutical including therapy. What else would be your suggestions? I want to increase sports (gym, jogging, tennis), quit porn consumption and decrease smart phone and social media use. Did anyone here experience some success story according depression and social anxiety, this emotional numbness and not-getting-stimulated-by-nothing being psychologically and physiologically inhibited, not being able to experience fun, interest, passion, drive and social life. "
d5k5fqy, It kills me that I pass by so many people every day and yet I live as if I was in a remote place in the mountains. This is a classic symptom of SA. One can either work on overcoming it or give up. At the moment I'm employing the latter approach. 
ekm3503, In where i live if you run people will laugh at you. Its a small town and its too strict. Your name will be heard all over the place if you do something like that 
pt17oy,"In 17 and havent done anything in 3 years. I dropped out of school, cut out all my friends, and havent done anything since. My anixety has gotten so bad in public ive even stopped going to get coffee in the mornings. Ive spent the last 3 years sitting in my room daydreaming and watching YouTube. My biggest struggle i think is walking. My anxiety is so bad in public i cant walk properly, i dont know how to move my arms, i cant turn my head to look around, and my legs get so tight i start limping and tripping over myself, its incredibly painful and i end up collapsing everytime i get back to my house from how exhausting the physical symptoms are. I have no achievements, no job, no hobbies, i have dreams of going for runs, dancing at clubs, swiming at the pool, reciting my slam poetry, socializing, and i havent. Its just really depressing to think about i guess."
5b748t," High school sucks. I swear, I'm a senior and so done with this shit. You truly deal with the scum of the earth on a daily basis, it's a living hell for someone with social anxiety. Yes, I'm writing this for catharsis. For example, I have a class where we cook food. We're in groups of four. I have three others in my group, a junior girl (who is somehow older than me), a freshman boy, and a freshman girl. They annoy the shit out of me! I'm the center of attention at all times! I had the junior girl and freshman boy in my first group (we have had three groups so far), and they were ridiculously annoying. I tried making small conversation with them, but of course people can sniff out if you're introverted. Now I have to deal with them again for another month, god help me! Unfortunately, we have a lot of downtime in this class. We only cook a couple days out of the week. This has resulted in my group members awkwardly playing ""Never-Have-I-Ever"", which I politely opted out of. I don't mind having to awkwardly listen to them play this, but that one freshman fuck is really getting on my nerves. He is getting too damn touchy with me. No, not in a blatantly sexual way, but it's suspect. I've been an avid weightlifter for awhile (although I've been slacking), so I have some degree of muscle mass on my arms. The other day he was commenting on my arms, that's fine to do I suppose. Then the day after that, he started feeling my arms (I guess to see if it was fat?) and he asked me to flex. I awkwardly did a half flex thing, he just said ""Nice triceps man, biceps are eh."". Okay? Why are you so interested in touching me? Then today, it got really weird. We had to cook, and he was immediately putting his hands on my shoulders from behind me as I was walking to the work area. I just ignored him, and we started cooking. Later on, this fucker started really getting on my nerves. We were sitting down after completing our meal, I was minding my own business as usual. All of a sudden he kind of waves his hand and hits the bangs of my hair, which are styled upward. I just responded with ""Fuck off with that touching shit."". Then this little fucker did it again, this time I snapped and lashed out and smacked his arm (albeit not hard) and said ""Fuck off! What the fuck?"". I knew right then it was cringe-worthy, I sounded and looked like an animal! He of course thought it was funny, but I was really pissed off. I never know how to express anger in these types of situations, I just want to have a full blown fight. Of course if that happens, I'll suffer public humiliation and severe repercussions due to my school's ""zero tolerance"" policies. I can't tell if this guy is a homosexual or not. The weird junior girl in my group always comments about how I'm ""handsome"" or ""adorable"", which is really annoying, by the way. One day she said I was ""adorable"", that freshman fucker (the male) agreed as well ""You are adorable, dicksoutforSAD."". What the fuck? He didn't even say this in a obviously joking manner. What the fuck is going on? Is this guy a homosexual, or is he trying to emasculate me by touching me? It literally ruined my weekend, I feel like this freshman fucker is putting me on edge. No, I'm not scared he could beat me up, I could easily kick his ass. "
a6zbe9,"What kind of bodily anxiety symptoms do you get and how do you go about dealing with them? This is the most difficult part of my anxiety.. I’m 24 years old and have had social anxiety as far back as I can remember, and it manifests in many different ways in my body that I can’t control. These are the hardest parts of my anxiety since I can’t control them and they’re the parts that are immediately visible to people. Some examples of this are my extremely shy bladder, where I cannot urinate if I know someone can hear me, especially someone I know well or in situations where I’m expected to go quickly and return to whatever I was found before. It’s pretty terrible and I’ve not been able to get over it throughout my entire adult life. Another example is when my face turns very red whenever a lot of attention is given to me. I can’t control this and it makes it hard to hide whenever I’m annoyed or angry or embarrassed by something, even if I don’t want to show my emotions. Another is how I cannot dance or sing in front of people without totally locking up. This is one that probably effects me the most, as it causes me to avoid any situations where I might be pressured to dance or sing. Lastly I sometimes can’t control my facial expressions in times of confrontation with other people. If someone is angry at me or if I am being asked something in a high pressure situation, like in an exam or by my boss about something, my mouth shakes and the corners of my mouth sort of droop down. It’s difficult to describe. It’s like my mouth sort of shakes and I can’t control it and I feel like I’ll tear up. I usually never actually tear up but I can feel my mouth moving. The only non-anxiety related time this happened to me was when I was young and jumped into a cold creek that I wasn’t expecting there to be a strong current in. I remember my mouth moving uncontrollably in almost the same way while I was swimming to the shore of the creek. It’s an odd comparison but they were almost the exact feeling of losing control over my body. When I really think about it, this is what my anxiety is truly about and it’s the physical things that I can’t control that have basically rendered me a totally different person than what I’d like to be. This anxiety has had such deep effects on my life and in my relationships throughout my life. I wish I knew a way to fix these things. I don’t live in a country where I have good access or support for therapy right now, so basically anything is up to me. It almost feels like these things are so deeply rooted in me that therapy isn’t enough. I was on anti-anxiety medication for a few years and while it helped with the emotional aspect of it, it never helped with the physical parts. I’m not depressed either, as I’ve gotten used to this for the most part. It just causes a lot of uncomfortable situations on a regular basis for me. The only thing that I’ve found that’s ever helped with these things was MDMA when I took it a couple times before. Those brief moments were the only times where I felt free from the cage this anxiety feels like to me. Has anyone else felt this way before? I’ve never met anyone in my life with symptoms like mine, though many people I’ve met said they have social anxiety."

pcfs1h,"Co-worker blew up in my face out of nowhere yesterday, How do I get over this?. 20M Here, Yesterday morning at 4:30 am I was driving to work at my fairly new job at a secluded golf course. The road is very long, boring and narrow and is very easy to zone out on. Naturally, I was still tired and my brain started to go somewhere else and without even realizing it, I started to tail behind my coworker's truck pretty closely for a large portion of the route. When I finally parked, I sat in my car for a few moments looking at my phone when suddenly I heard my side door swing open. I look over to find a buff bald guy almost twice my height, two inches in front of my face saying ""If you follow that closely behind me to work again, we're gonna have a serious fucking problem!"", I responded with something like ""Oh okay, I'm sorry."". He glared at me for a few seconds after that, then slammed my door. Logically, I fully admit to my mistake and I understand why he was so mad, it was an extremely poor lapse of judgement and I probably would've been angry too if I were him. The whole thing was just so startling and out of nowhere, it may have even been traumatizing. I've never had a stranger yell in my face like that before. I can't help but replay it over and over again in my head it's really affecting my mood. I just wish I wasn't such an emotional thinker."
e0ijg42," That's so true! Rock climbing is a challenge for socially anxious people but I think it's also super rewarding. I mean, if you can do that, you can do a *lot* of things. I am going back there tomorrow and try again. Thanks for the tips man, very appreciated. "
a2m38d," Is anyone else extremely sensitive to criticism at work?. Feel free to just respond to the title but I wanted to share as well, sometimes writing a post on reddit helps me cut back on the ruminations and obsessive negative thoughts. I’ve started working at my uncles cafe a couple weeks ago and it’s hectic, there’s often lines going out the door especially on the weekends. I was doing so well according to the weekday workers, for the first time in my life I was that person who was just really good at something with little to no experience. It was weird but I liked it and it made me happy to come into work and do research online at home to learn new things like how to make a proper cappuccino and do latte art. Everything was fun until I did a Saturday shift, and it was hell on earth, just order after order endlessly, pushing and squeezing to get around 12 other coworkers in a tight space, stuff just going missing and customers loosing patience (Unlike during the week where there are rushes and slow periods, you could give your customer your individual attention and work quickly yes but also in a sense with love). I would start trying to find little odd tasks here and there to avoid the line even for just a few seconds, stuff that needed to be done (taking out trash, fixing up the display, replenishing stock that was running low) but were not a priority so I understand why I got called out for it. So a coworker (see that just makes it even more pathetic that I’m upset over something and I don’t even know who it was could of been a manager or just a regular team member) with her stinging valley girl voice said “can you please stop worrying about the bagels and just help the line”. ( I don’t even know if there was any real frustration in her tone or if my head just assumed it, here I am being an asshole making subconscious judgments against this woman for doing her job) but something about that made me almost cry at work and I couldn’t stop replaying it in my head, I managed to keep the waterworks at bay thank god because it would have just been so embarrassing to cry over what was literally nothing. I think I was just already overwhelmed and the comment was just the straw that broke the camels back. I was also the first person who got asked if I wanted to go home early, which just added to my paranoia. Wondering if they wanted me to go because I suck. No one said anything when I left either. Maybe I did just have a shit time that day? Idk. "
4e6tkl,"Do I have social anxiety?. Hello /r/socialanxiety , I have read on internet about some psychological disorders like Social Anxiery or Aspenger's and others. There aresome differences between them and I am not sure in what category I am, or if I am in any. I will just write here about my personality and if you could say me I am normal or I have some syndrome. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ I am currently 19 years old. Everybody refered to me as 'quitet' one, in every group. Trough elementary school I made few friends, but all my friendships fell apart. Some friends turned out to be assholes and just use me and then talk sit behind my back. Two true friends from schools moved to other city and I lost contact with them. So basicly I have no friends. In middleschool my schoolmates invited me to some parties, camping and stuff like this, but that was only because I was with them in class and they were just nice. I didn't developed friendship with any of them. Nowadays I am at college and I do not know here anybody. I spend all my freetime in my room. From young age till now I have proplem talking with people. I can't find words when I am talking with somebody. Everything that you ask me about, I can describe only shortly. I can't find about what could I talk. Even if I am at robotic competition, which is my hobby, and I see someone here with good robot, but I am not able to find questions that I could ask him, despite his robot is advanced that my and he could give me useful information. Because of this, or because of something else I am scared of talking with people. I avoid them. When I go somewhere, I just hope that I won't meet somebody that I know. I am also scared to talk to salesclerk. In supermarket it is OK, because I pick th stuff and I pay for it without talking, but if I need to ask for something, no way, I just order it online. I don't go to barber for same reason. Other thing that I noticed is that I can't argue. For example my roomate told me that I schould clean kitchen and I immediately did it, despite that I cleaned it last time and he is one that always mess it up. If I need to say something loudly for 5+ people group, I get really nervous, sweaty, my hands are shaking. Manytimes this will result that people will not understand what am I saying and it makes things even worse. I do not want to socialize. I am happy alone, but I think that it would be better if I had some friends. For expample I could find better job. My self-esteem is really low and I underestimate my abilities. I do not like to take pictures of myself. I have only one picture on facebook. I am smarter that lot of people. In logical thinking I am in upper 1 percent of population. Math and programming are not poblem for me. My hobbies are cycling, RC models and arduino/robotics. As you may guessed I cycle alone. For RC models, there are guys in my town, but I better go flying to another field where I am alone. I will add that I have no problem detaching from my parrents. I live at dormitory and I visit home like once every two months, so basicly I am on my own. Except I don't know many things like I have problem going to doctor or to some office, I don't know where it is, what sould I do, etc. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ I probably have forgotten many things, but if you could write me that type of psychological disorder I have, that would be nice. And also how do you heal social disorders? I have read many things on internet tha were toxins, glutan, oils, teas and other bulshits, you know :) . I have tried using Second Life game, but people there weren't talking on microphone, maybe just one or two."
elitmkq," Im a girl. I have hairy arms, a big chest (a cup or two bigger than everyone else in my grade), and feel like my stomach sticks out a bit. I absolutely LOVE swimming but hate being in public doing it. With family or friends is fine but not public. Especially because usually itll just be me and my mom and my mom will stay out and not swim. I cant really do much because I dont actually know how to swim or do any tricks so I just have to kind of waddle around awkwardly. "
q7ltnj," So I met a girl. I’m 19m, kind of a loner, not good with people, have social anxiety. But the other day I downloaded tinder to just see what it’s all about, matched with this girl and we started talking, she asked for my snap, started talking on there, then we met up irl, and it went decent I would say. We kept talking and everything and met up a second time, and now we’re planning a trip to go to the beach this weekend. Ya know I have no idea if she’s like into me in a relationship sort of way or if she just wants to be my friend, but I honestly don’t care, I like her as a friend and if something more happens then it happens. But the reason why I say something in me has changed is, before I was so alone and I wanted to be in a relationship so badly, I wanted intimacy, and all that, but now I’m actually talking to someone that I could potentially have all that but it’s like a switch went off and don’t really care about any of that anymore. I just enjoy talking to her, being around her, and if nothing even happens between us I’m fine with it. Another thing I’ve noticed, is when I used to masturbate, I just sort of did it and then didn’t really think anything of it, but I literally like don’t have urges to do it anymore, and when I went to do it one time, I just felt disgusting. I didn’t even do it cause it felt wrong which I had never had that feeling before. Idk what happened to me but something definitely did So I’m 19m, I’ve only dated one person back in freshman year of highschool. And I sort of gave up on trying to get in a relationship, but the other day I downloaded tinder cause I’m insecure and wanted to know if people would actually be interested in me or whatever, and I matched with this girl. I’ve matched with quite a few people on there but I never message them because I’m too scared to, but this girl had her Instagram in her bio, so I looked it up and saw one of my friends following her. So I messaged her asking if she went to my hs, which she didn’t, but then we started talking, and we legit talked for like a solid hour, she asked for my snap, then we started talking on there. The next day we’re talking again and decide to meet up, so we met up somewhere, went thrifting, she picked out an outfit for me to try on, then we went to chic fil a and got food, and just sat in her car talking for a few hours, and she gave me her number. We met up a second time last night, we went to a boat dock at like 10pm at night, played music and just talked while looking out at the lake. I had a good time. I really like her. And now we are planning to go to the beach this weekend which I’m excited about. And she wants to get matching Halloween costumes and go to a party. But like, I’m confused if she’s even into me in that sort of way, or if she just wants to be friends, because all the stuff I’ve said seems pretty obvious she’s into me, but we had this deep convo about how she doesn’t know if she wants a relationship, and I’m not really gonna get into it but it basically contradicts everything. but honestly I don’t even care if we’re just friends, I’m just happy for once, talking to someone, hanging out with someone who understands me, it feels good. And she also said she might be moving away soon which really sucks but I guess we can still text? I guess part of the reason I’m making this post is because I felt hopeless, like I’d never meet somebody, I’d be alone forever, and I know a lot of you guys on here feel the same way. And the other reason is I wanted to share this with someone cause it feels like a big change in my life. I wasn’t even trying to talk to or meet new people, it just sort of happened, and I guess that’s how most things go, so don’t give up people, one day it will be your turn at happiness "
o9z5jw,"It’s hard for a ugly 16 y girl. Tried to go to a small party. I really just wanted some weed and to see my one “friend ” there, but it was super dark and hot outside and i knew no one some drunk girl came up to me and asked me my name, then walked away laughing. I just stood all awkward there then left. I am not even sure I want friends but i do envy people in groups walking together and happy. my birthday is coming up and I have no friends to celebrate with. I keep thinking that maybe if i loose weight and dress nice and shit, post stuff on instagram that maybe I’ll make some friends but i doubt that. I am mostly fine on my own, just summer nights are a little lonely…"
qk26iu," Sports good for teen that struggle with big crowds?. Hi nickname is Kai and I’m 15 girl. And I’m trying to get into a sport the last sport I done was in 6th grade. I am extremely introverted and find it discomforting to be around a lot of people. I think I have anxiety disorder which is probably factoring into having a hard time getting into a sport and sticking with it. At my next appointment I should get an answer to wether or not I have an anxiety diagnosis or if we need to test me for other things like autism. But I definitely do know I have issues with anxiety. Every time I find a fun sport when I go to first practice it starts escalating into boringness, then I begin dreading going to practice and then I quit. And then get pissed of fat myself for quitting for about a day. I think I just hate the thought of being in the presence of so many ppl. I like sports that only involve me and the instructor like my horse riding class in 5-6th grade. I only had to meet the other students 4 times out of my whole training time at that stable. But I don’t want to do it bc it’s expensive like 200$ a month. Basically sports that hv a little team, participants and one instructor. Kinda like dance classes. But I have stage fright now. And I also don’t like sports that require 5-6 days training every week and including summer training. If my parents would do 50/50 schedule like 3-3-4-4 it’d be different. But I can’t do that bc I’d never hear the end of it with sports cutting into visitation time. "
o5wymm,Making plans. I’m 21 year old guy with severe anxiety and a bunch of other issues. I overthink A TON and my anxiety overwhelms me. I get nervous overwhelmed and confused very easy in social settings I’ve been good friends with this girl since high school. We’re both 21 now. We randomly talk and stay in touch through text/Snapchat pretty often. She’s recently been reaching out saying we should get together and hangout. She wanted to go to a bar together then go back to her house and chill and listen to music. I replied and agreed and she said she’d let me know when she’s back in town Yesterday she texted me saying she has a car so now we can go on adventures together. I replied saying “we could go to the beach for a day or go somewhere vegan” (she’s vegan). She replied. “We should frolic in the woods and smoke a doobie” I just replied “frolic is the key word.” And sent a funny pic of dancing bears . She replied “THATS AMAZING” I replied “hopefully we see dancing bears on our adventure” She replied “next week for sure” I haven’t replied yet I feel like they don’t really mean it. If they REALLY wanted to hangout they’d ask “when are you free next week?” Instead of just vaguely saying “next week for sure” Idk it just feels like it’s all just big joke. Idk why people reach out FIRST asking to make plans if they don’t actually mean it. Why would she keep reaching out if she doesn’t really mean it?
dl9uev1,"It was way worse for me from like 8th until 10th or 11th grade. It impacted my school results a lot, I'd skip out on answering questions just because of it. Sometimes I would skip a few classes or even spend the whole day in a forest doing jack shit. nnShaky hands we're the worse part, dancing classes we're cancer, I hated my native language classes because the group was small and everyone had to do something (write on the blackboard, read etc..), math was ok, but I was shit at it, most of it was pretty awful tbh."
ey9af9q,"I'm 24 years old (so don't shit yourself cuz ur only 20) and was petrified around women and was a virgin up until two months ago. Now I'm highly comfortable around women, and keep having experiences with them!I can describe what I did. I used to be absolutely terrified of women and I was extremely needy around them. This was because I cared way too much what they thought about. Rejection was devestating to me. So what I did was over a space of a few months approach 100 approach (strangers) at parks, cafes, school, clubs and talked to them and asked them out on dates. I got rejected nearly all the time, but I reduced my fear of rejection dramatically, felt far more comfortable talking around them. Now I'm more assertive with them. Girls are not going to make the first move, so you're going to have to learn to assert yourself and show what you want, take risks. I suggest you do this rejection practice to get over your fear of rejection and to improve your social skills. In tandem with this, read the following books (1) Intimate Connections by David Burns (it's based on cognitive behavioural therapy but oriented towards dating, relationship stuff. Excellent book. ) My advice is hard, but it's the best and most effective way. If you do this rejection practice, you can end up making an almost 180 degree turn in how you relate with and feel around women. Push your ass!"
fpnumu3," Start small. What's something you avoid that perhaps you are capable of doing? Perhaps, you avoid saying hi to people when you go for a walk. It makes you anxious and so you avoid it, but perhaps this is doable for you. It makes you anxious, but not so anxious you simply can't do it. Start with that, be consistent, and gradually increase the difficulty. Commit to not avoiding as a way of life. Commit to discomfort as a way of life. Make pain your god. Being angry at yourself doesn't help. You will fail over and over and that's okay. Consistency is the key. "
670k4o," I'm scared of being seen.. I am so weird honestly. I am 16 years old and i'm a junior in high school. I really don't have many friends and I wish I did. The thing is though. I'm hideous. I am scared of being seen by others. I am scared of walking to classes. I am scared of being photographed. I look at myself at the mirror sometimes and think ""hey not that bad"". I look at my reflection in other places and think I am the most hideous thing on earth. I hate being photographed. I look repulsive. Ugh. I am scared of people seeing me. Sometimes I feel that I sense a sort of repulsion as soon as people see me. They don't say it blatantly ""Hey you're ugly!"" but I feel as though there is something in there eyes saying that to me. I have a hard time talking with people. You know, I actually have a crush on someone. She's in my french class. I have started talking to her a bit. We studied last week. We agreed we would study Wednesday but she had to cancel last minute because she had to eat lunch before her swim meet. I tell her ""its all cool no worries, we can study some other time if it's cool."" Just overall I feel that people judge me all the time. I don't feel like a boy physically. I see every other single boy at my school and think, hey they look like a boy. I look at myself and think, what the hell?! I don't know, today I went to some shops by the beach and I was so scared. I usually walk with my head down so people don't see me. I was so nervous at the store because I think that people would judge me for trying to buy something new. ""Buying clothes won't make you look any better. Get out of here!"" Ugh, I'm sorry. Im crying at this point so ill stop rambling. Probably annoying some of you. I feel that I do that to people. Sorry about that. If you read this. Thank you so much. If you guys have any advice on how to be less weird or how to talk to that girl, that would be great. Thanks guys. &lt; 3 Sorry again. "
ojp562, I just don’t understand. I just don’t understand My friend who’s a girl texted me saying we should hangout soon. I told her I’m at the beach but we should hang when I get back Then a couple days later she’s like “I’m taking a day trip tomorrow what beach are you at!?” I told her I’m in Strathmere which is close to Ocean City and offered to hangout and she’s like “awe poo I’m in sea isle” I took that as a rejection so i just shut down and replied “it’s ok another time”. She never even answered Why do people make plans to hangout when they really just intend to reject you??? I just don’t understand 
o2vs6i,"Please don’t lose hope. I am what you would call the most awkward person to ever exist. From the age of 9 to the age of 16 (my current age) I had literally **zero** friends. That’s not an exaggeration. People thought I was a potential school shooter because I always wore a hoodie and tried to avoid everyone. Shit changed this past school year. I was in virtual class with someone who was just as awkward as I am, and we did not immediately hit it off. A lot of painfully awkward conversations later, he invited me to hang out with him. The rest is history. We’re best friends and I’m going to the beach with him this coming Monday! Point is, don’t lose hope y’all. This sounds cliche and like bs but **there is someone out there for you.** It’s hard to believe but it’s true. You don’t have to change yourself to make friends, your socially awkward self is just fine. I love you guys this sub helped me so much. ❤️"
eipvu9k," I just try and get out of the house for as long as possible wether it be driving for hours on end, hiking, or just doing errands. I tried the party scene but it's not really my thing. "
dli1g1y," If you don't mind me asking, what did you say that made people turn on you like that? Thanks for the advice I'm really just going to take advantage of this semester as a playground to try things I've never done, since your experience of ""practicing"" in a temporary place seemed to work out well. "
ft91oo2,"100% understand you on this. It's improved slighty now, but there a times were it used to take me 3 days of mental preparation just to feel confident enough to go outside and just buy something simple like eggs. Even then I'd still be anxious. It feels so unnecessary and it sucks. I hope one day we'll both get to a place where we can confidently live our lives without our brains freaking out over what other people think. Even though it can be tough, you're amazing for still making the effort to go out and do what needs to be done."
s8oeq8,"I (16M) want to talk to a love interest (16F, classmate) more, but I worry that I annoy her. So, theres this girl in my class, who I first talked to in September, when we had a pretty long conversation on special day of school, when basically the entire school was outside, and we could do whatever we wanted. Ever since then, I just knew she was the one. I tried talking to her as much as I could in-person - there's one lesson every day which her friends arent present on, so thats when I started some sort of small-talk (mostly about tests, I dont know what else to come up with). Unfortunately, 2 months ago, my mom made me stay home because of covid... Now, she did write to me on the first day I stayed home, and a couple more times, asking how my day was, so I started doing that as well. But ever since I wrote to her first, there was no time when she began a conversation. Another thing I'd like to mention is that I managed to be brave enough to call her up twice in December, and once last week. Plus, somehow I was also brave enough to ask her if she wants to go on a walk - she said yes and we went on December 30th! Now, I'm just waiting, and I don't want to initiate a conversation, I want her to do it, so I know she at least likes me as a friend. But I REALLY just want to text her to start a conversation, those always cheer me up, especially since my anxiety has been killing me since I had to stay home (the time I went on a, walk with her was the only time I went out in these 2 months). Should I just... do it? What if she doesnt actually like me, and she only talked to me cuz of empathy towards this whole thing? Or does she only do it because she feels bad for me living in a wheelchair? I mean, she seems like she's having a good time when I talk to her... Is it better if I wait till she texts me? What should I do?"
gf6kxf," Social anxiety got worse now that lockdown is getting over. So I'm spanish and since Sunday we can go outside for an hour depending on your age. I was super excited, until I went outside. I can't even look at people at their faces. I fear I'm being judged by everyone and seeing someone that I know is super awkward now. "
ewab6ps," How bout riding a bike? It’s probably the only thing I can do that makes my anxiety completely disappear. I always go by myself too, which makes it a lot easier. "
e4y8gi5,"first of all, you're pretty young -- when I was your age my hormones caused me to be on some whoooole other shit, constantly freaking out over drama I thought was life-changing but was actually all in my head.nn&amp;#x200B;nnIf you want to get rid of your phobias, you can do it. Just figure out ways that you feel good about yourself and go towards those ways. working out? making art? being in the forest? having sex? whatever it may be, start to seek it out, and above all have faith. One day you'll find yourself in a place where the people around you genuinely appreciate YOU for who you are -- they'll even appreciate the ""sweat disorder"", lol! That wouldn't be a problem for the people I roll with. We like difference and we like when people embrace themselves. Hang in there buddy, you're still really fucking young -- there's a lot going on chemically .... if there's one piece of advice I can give, it's DO SOMETHING EVERY DAY THAT EMBARRASSES YOU. that will give the fear of embarrassment way less power. You got this young man"
9a3tja," Venting :/. I read the rules and venting seems to be allowed on this sub but if it isn't then please let me know and I'll take this down. This post is probably going to be long and boring (hopefully it's not though for the sake of anybody who wants to read it all haha). &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; To start this off I'm 17 years old and I start my senior year in 3 days. This past year or so has been stressful, surprising and somewhat wild at times. I've talked to people about different pieces of this story but I don't think that any one person knows everything which is why I am writing it here and because I don't have anybody that I trust enough or am comfortable enough to tell everything to. I don't really know where to start so I think I'll just write this in pieces with different headings since I think that'll be easiest. I think I will put everything in a somewhat chronological order since that will probably be easiest to read :) &amp;#x200B; # The Breakup Sometime in early August of last year, from what I remember, a girl (who I'll call ""A"" from now on) that I had sort of been with for a little bit over a year broke up with me. This wasn't the first time she had broken up with me so by then I was used to it. But for some reason this time felt different and I don't really know why. An important thing to know about the relationship between me and A is that her parents never liked me which was important to her but, being younger and dumber than I am now, I thought things would still be ok even with that but, as you can imagine, they weren't. For some reason she was still ok with trying to be together and continue talking or whatever but it always ended in either her getting in trouble for it or her breaking up with me for a little bit and then sort of getting back together with me and then her getting in trouble again and that whole process starting over again. I realize how unhealthy this was for me because she probably broke up with me around 10-15 times at least. I became unbothered by whether or not she was breaking up with me. I just sort of went with the flow and when she wanted to get back together I would or if she made it seem like she wanted me to pursue her I would. I know that sounds really stupid and I definitely played a huge part in letting that happen to me and doing things that kept it from stopping, if that makes sense. Anyways, that whole summer pretty much had been spent at my sister's house where I had to help watch her kids all day which was a bit of a struggle since they were both under 2 and I had to watch them for most hours of the day and only got about 1 meal a day because they hardly ever bought groceries that I was 'allowed' to use. So eventually this kind of made my social anxiety worse and being at my sister's house in general was somewhat tense because of issues she was having with her kids and husband that had to do with her post postpartum depression. I decided to leave a week or so earlier than I had planned to come back home because it had become too stressful for me and of top of that I would get to see A again if I went back home, since my sister lives pretty far away from where I live. Now that I'm finally back to the main point of this part (I'm sorry if any of that was rambling but I think it was pretty important and I want to get it out) which is the break up, I like to think that I dealt with it pretty well compared to how I deal with other things sometimes. When school started back up me and A saw each other everyday for the first week because of homeroom and by the end of the week we were talking again. I then found out she was sort of talking to a new guy who I had been kind of friends with since I was 6 or 7 years old. She had mentioned him during the summer and just said they had been texting and it seemed like a friend thing so I didn't really worry or think much of it. Until sometime this year I never really thought about it much but I realized that at some point when they were talking that summer she must have told him that me and her were no longer a thing because during the following school year he said some stuff to me/about me that didn't make sense until I realized that because he just saw me as trying to cockblock him and fuck up his chances, which is somewhat reasonable from his perspective. I don't really know how to feel about this even after all this time because I guess it was cheating sort of but I don't really know if it technically or not so I don't know if it should bother me. &amp;#x200B; # The Drinking As the school year continued the issues between me and A increased. Her talking to the other boy caused her to stop talking to me and get angry at me more often. At the time, and I really hate saying this, I didn't have any real friends, and I never really had I guess, who I could talk to about the whole situation between me and her. I think that is why I was still always there for her and ready to get back together or still going after her if she seemed like that's what she wanted. Some time during the middle of last fall I started drinking. At first it wasn't a lot. Just maybe one or two nights a week. It quickly changed into me drinking during the day at the same frequency. It was nicer to drink during the day because then it was easier for me to socialize. Not long after that it became me drinking 3-4 times a week during the day. I don't really know how long I kept doing that. Maybe a month or month and a half which isn't too bad but I mean drinking during the day/at school isn't really a smart thing to do. The fall turned into winter and eventually A broke up with me again. By now that number had to be at 20 or so. This time was the weekend before Thanksgiving break while I was with my dad's family for Thanksgiving, which was the second time she had broken up with me on a holiday haha. I barely even cared because it had become so common. After that I don't think I ever talked to her again, at least from what I remember. She never knew about my drinking because I avoided her when I was drunk since she was very against drugs/drinking and she had gotten me in trouble with something similar that I told her. &amp;#x200B; # The Other Drugs After the final breakup near Thanksgiving, I quit drinking and I was just kind of happy. It was nice to not have to worry about A for real this time. Christmas started getting closer and I began taking Xanax, Adderall, and Vyvanse because I could get them all for pretty cheap compared to what I could get them for before. I met some new friends at a school thing and I actually started hanging out with them in late December. The first few times I couldn't even think about going to hang out without taking a lot of Adderall first. It took everything about my social anxiety away. For the first time since I was a kid, I had friends. Actual people who wanted to be around me and found me funny and cool. I didn't have to worry about what they thought, I didn't have to be scared of meeting new people, I didn't even have to think twice about what I wanted to say. Adderall took all of those worries and fixed them and I thought it made me a better person. Christmas break ended and we were back in school and for once I was enjoying it since I actually had real friends for once. Exams came not long after and I was taking and selling more Adderall and Vyvanse than I was before Christmas break which makes sense of course. After exams, some bad experiences being too stimmed out during them, and the decrease in people doing Adderall/Vyvanse I quit doing them for the most part. During December there were a few times where I took too much Xanax in school and blacked out and ended up doing some pretty stupid stuff and some rather dangerous and reckless things, in and out of school, which I luckily never got in trouble for. Luckily I never hurt anyone or myself during a blackout either. As the second semester began I started vaping more too and eventually I became pretty addicted to it and in a way it also helped my anxiety but also hurt it in some ways. In the second semester I ended up in a few classes with a lot more of my new friends. I was really excited about this but looking back on it this probably hurt me more than I realized at the time. When I was around them we would sort of encourage each other to do stupid things as kids do I guess. We ended up all doing Xanax pretty often. I don't really know how bad it was for some of my friends since we're not that close anymore but from what I remember or can gather from pictures there was at least two or three weeks where I went through at least 10-15 bars (2mg per bar and for most people a bar is enough to make them black out with no tolerance for those that don't know) a week, which I only took on weekdays since I would take it to get rid of anxiety and then end up taking more during the day, on my own or possibly more since I was selling them too and probably took some of those as well. I don't remember a lot from that time since most of it was spent asleep or blacked out. About a week before I decided to quit using Xanax since I realized I had at the very least a small problem with it, I was invited to spend the night at a friend of a friend's house. The day I went over there was the first time I smoked weed. Later that night me and two of the other guys there ended up doing lines of Valium and we had a pretty good night. The next day the friend's house who we were at was having his girlfriend over and he asked me to stay since she was bringing a friend and I decided to since I kind of had to so he'd have a wingman or whatever. I thought it was sort of what I was supposed to do. The girls came over and me and my new friend bought more Valium and me and him snorted ours so it would feel stronger and the girls just took theirs. I pretty faded after the Valium and I didn't know what to do so I just went along with the making out and everything with the girlfriend's friend. We never had sex but there was just like some stuff going on. It makes me feel sort of weird to think about since it feels like I was just a little too messed up to try and get out a situation I didn't want to be in. I don't think I was raped or anything because that's clearly not what happened but I feel like I was maybe taken advantage of in a way and nobody really takes me seriously when I talk about it since I'm a guy and I don't know why it still sort of bothers me and I don't know how to deal with it. But anyways other than that I slowed down on taking Xanax that week and my friends all decided to quit sort of together. That next Friday night, which was two days before from my birthday, me and one of my, at the time, best friends took maybe 2 and a half bars each and then we quit for real together. &amp;#x200B; # Getting Caught A week after my birthday my best friend's mom got into his phone and saw our friends group' groupchat and she told all of our parents. That afternoon me, my best friend, and his other best friend were all sitting in a doctor's office getting an intervention talk from like half of our parents and maybe 4 or 5 doctors. We all got piss tested and had to watched during it which was sort of weird. It was my first time getting an intervention talk even though I had been caught with drugs by my parents twice before. The rest of that day was spent by getting yelled at by my parents. They told me I had to go to choose between: a new school, getting a mental evaluation at a drug counseling facility (which I have had one of at the ER before which is why I didn't take this option), or I could go to therapy. I decided therapy would be the easiest so I went with that. I lost all pretty much all my privileges pretty much. I couldn't see my friends (which hurt me more than it had the other times I had gotten in trouble because this time I had friends I could hang out with), I couldn't use my phone, I couldn't have cash with me or have any money in my bank account anymore, and I couldn't use my laptop even for school work. Before getting caught I had also found a guy who could ship me stuff from a state where weed is legal if I sent him money for it. I don't even really remember how I got the money, looking back on a lot of this I'm not really sure how I got the money for a lot of stuff I was either too high to remember or selling any drugs I had to get other ones, but before too long me and a few of my friends had ordered some stuff from him and things definitely weren't as bad as they had been before but it still wasn't good for us. After a month or so I was allowed to hang out with some of my friends again. After getting caught I had also started drinking every once in a while when my friends could get me liquor they could give away. I probably never spent more than a week and a half sober from January until June. Pretty much all of my friends quit using basically all pills back when we quit Xanax but we still drank, smoked weed, ate edibles, vaped, and used thc pens way too often still. From what I can remember me and maybe one or two other friends would occasionally do pills together if we felt like it but it was nowhere near as often as it had been before. &amp;#x200B; # Falling off The Golf Cart At the very end of May I was hanging out with the guy who was my best friend at the time. We were just hanging out in his neighborhood and at the pool and driving around on his golf cart. I asked him if I could drive it since I had never driven one before and he let me. I drove it wayyy too fast and fell off it while I was driving it and it ran me over in the process and I got a ton of road burn on my leg that was kind of deep. I hid it from my parents because I was scared of getting in trouble or being accused of being on something when it happened. I could barely walk about 6 hours after it happened and I decided I had to tell my parents two days later when it wasn't getting better. When I told them I lied and said my friend was driving when it happened and they believed me and after I was a little better and could walk a little bit more they wouldn't let me hang out with the friend it happened with because they blame him for it which is pretty much why he's no longer my best friend and we just don't talk anymore. Even though it's been almost 3 months my leg is still pretty fucked up looking but it doesn't hurt that much anymore. A lot of my other friends kind of stopped talking to me too since I had to tell them I couldn't hang out since I couldn't walk easily for like 3-4 weeks after falling off the golf cart and I think they thought it was just an excuse. &amp;#x200B; # Senior Year Like I said at the top of this post I start my senior year on Monday. I'm really nervous about it because I haven't really been in school and been sober at the same time in a while. Also all summer I haven't done many drugs which I know is good for me but now I just don't know how to cope with going back to school and being around so many people since this whole summer I've either been alone at home or at my sister's for a few weeks. I'm also kind of sad about applying for college because it feels like nobody is proud of me or happy for me about it except for my sister. I told my parents that I was applying to a few places and they basically just said ""Oh that is good"" and not much else. I know it's not a huge deal but I was kind of excited about it and it feels like that's what they wanted from me this whole time I've been in high school and I finally took the first step to doing it and they don't even seem that proud of it. Also I've only been home for like a week after going to my sister's and we've already gotten in to two arguments over the stupidest things which just makes me feel like they really don't want me here and just want to cause problems with me which I have felt for kind of a while because just since January they have threatened to kick me out like 4 or 5 times which I get isn't that bad and it could be worse but it still makes me feel bad. &amp;#x200B; If you made it all the way to the end that you so much for reading all of that. I hope it was somewhat interesting to read. If anybody has any advice or help they want to give me I would love it because tbh right now I don't have a ton of reliable friends to talk to or help me out. And if anyone has any questions about what I said you can ask me because I know some of my writing probably is somewhat confusing and possibly long winded. Hope y'all have a great day :) "
c3z9p9,"I need advice quick. Ok so right now I'm currently at a campground, there's always a whole bunch of kids out. So me (16) and my cousin (15) were walking to the lake and go on the swings and talk. But these 3 girls stopped us and ask for our snaps on the way. After that we went the opposite direction. Now they're texting and they most likely want to meet. I'm scared out of my mind shitless not wanting to do it. Ik it sounds like complete pussy shit, but I need advice to help me through this, I'm having an anxiety attack rn"
e42pa7m," Lol I don't even have any social media. To be fair, I never had a use for it because I never got the point of sharing everything with everyone. I've always kept to myself, but now I do see the benefits of sharing a bit of yourself. Tbh, I'd probably feel the same, but only because I think the things I enjoy aren't accepted enough. In reality, people on social media are less self aware about their posts because they see them as just that, one little post among a sea of many. I'm not the best person to give advice on that, but try caring less. Literally, try caring less about what you post, close out of facebook, forget the moment, be thankful for any likes and return to your daily activities. Damn, maybe one day I can follow my own advice lol. "
jh7oxw,Worst fear just came true.. (16M) One of my biggest fears was living in the same apartment as someone i know in school. Im very socially awkward and i hate going outside to big and popular places because of this reason. I moved recently to a big city and I saw someone who looked like they are from my school. Later i saw them again from a far distance and heard my name shouted 3 times like they were trying to find me. I ran away.
6hmudq," I've come so far, but it's frustrating to feel like my goal is still so far away.... Hey Everyone, I'm Jonathan, a 20 year old German guy, and this is my story! I've always been a kind of shy person for all my life! I remember being scared of ordering icecream when I was a child. On the first day at my first 4 schools (I went to 6) I cried because I was scared. All that got even worse when I was bullied in 5th-6th grade. During that time I was ashamed as soon as anyone glanced at me, I felt so judged that I wished the ground would open and swallow me up. At my new school for 7th-8th grade I was integrated with the boys of my class, but I could never speak my mind if I was talking to more than 1 person, I was trying so hard to fit in that I someone else would have an opinion, and agree with that. I could never speak to girls, and I vividly remember one time when I was at the movies with a friend, and we ran into a girl from our class there, and I was so anxious when I hugged her, it felt like I had a pulse of 300. And whenever I would be talking to a girl I would just blank, freeze and start sweating. In 9th grade at yet another school I was in a class of 2-3 girls and 15-16 boys. The boys where extremely competitive, and constantly dissing each other just for fun. I couldn't really get used to that, and stayed at home feeling sick a lot that year. In 10th grade I changed to another class in that same school. I made some good friends I was able to speak my mind to, and started to become more confident with my opinion. I also did quite some public speaking that year: I became the students representative and had to give speeches in front of the whole school (200-300 people), and also had to moderate a school festival on stage (also a few hundred people). We also had to do a presentation of our final paper in front of a few hundred people. After that I didn't wanna continue school right away, and stayed at home for about a year. I became pretty lonely during that time, and had some mild phases of depression. Then I got a job at a local gas station, and with that I got way more used to making small-talk with people. I mostly stuck to the necessary sentences tho, and very rarely really had a conversation with people (compared to my colleagues that had a conversation with almost half the people). In December 2016, after a year at the gas station, I decided to quit my job and fulfill my dream to go to Australia for a year of work and travel. Before that I went to Spain where I visited my uncle. Since he lives on a mountain I didn't really get to go out that much, and the few times I did go out, I was pretty anxious, when I decided to eat something I sometimes wandered around for 30-60 minutes because I was to scared to go into a restaurant, I think the language barrier had something to do with that, but fears like that were something I hadn't experienced for a while. Right now I'm in a Hostel in Australia, and on my afirst few days I started talking to 2 German girls, and we went out a few times. That would've been unthinkable even just a year or two ago, so I""m very happy I was able to do that! They had to leave and go back to Germany after a few days tho (1,5 weeks ago) and after that I became more and more anxious. I bought a laptop to edit my photos on when they left, and the first few days I only used it for that, but then I started watching YouTube on there, and spending a lot of time behind the screen. The last few days have been like this: I want to talk to people, and there are lots of people around, I even have ideas how I could initiate a conversation, but I can't get myself to do it. I feel like it would be weird, or that I would bother them, because they're doing their own thing or they're in their own conversation already. So I just sit there between all these people that are having conversations and are socializing, and just can't get myself to join them. This has been going on for the last few days. I mean it's good that I at least had to go shopping a few times so I got out of the hostel, and at least talked to the cashiers. I also had a few conversations with the people in my room, I think that was good for not getting too much into a downward-spiral, but the conversations were never longer than a few minutes, and there wasn't anyone I could really spend time with. So right now I feel a little stuck: I wanna socialize, and I think I've gotten kind of decent with that, but I just can't for the heck of it initiate a conversation when it's not served on a gold platter. And it has to be a really shiny and well polished gold platter. (Like new people moving into my room, or meeting someone I've seen in the Hostel outside the Hostel. TL;DR: I've come pretty far, from being ashamed of people just looking at me, to being on the other side of the planet on my own, and meeting new people, but I'm still not quite where I wanna be. I can have a conversation, but it's still extremely hard for me to initiate one, but I feel a little stuck, and don't really know how to get myself to just initiate a conversation. "
dzvnbwm,I get you. Sometimes I go for a walk.
etemmw9,"Well i squandered highschool as well. Second last year of highschool they tell me my school is closing and i need to pick a new highschool having a grass is always greener on the other side mentality i get excited about going to a new school. BUT i go to the new school that has a couple thousand kids (rich spoiled kidsbtw completely different from old school) vs the 400 kids who knew each other from my old school, overwhelmed by the new school i give up thinking there no point in attempting to make friends and try to get over my SA so i isolate myslef from everyone causing me to become depressed and full of self hatred leading me to barely graduate highschool it was literally the worst year of my life to date. Didnt realize i was squandering HS because of my SA which led me to isolate myself and worsen my mental health if i could go back and redo it NOPE. Fuck that i only look forward dont dwell on the past man thats long gone noone judges you based on highschool experiences if they were supposed to have been the best years of my life like ppl claim then i would have killed myself fuck alll that shit everyone i knew in highschool was immature and selfcentered. I was a teenager who disliked other teenagers, maybe it was because i was held back a year but i got so sick of teenagers and highschool felt like a toxic enviornment for me. No now that im writing this id say i squandered highschool because highschool was shit and i couldnt wait to get out of that media glorifies things like prom ppl say best years of your life no fucking way i couldnt stand to be there another moment i didnt keep in touch with anyone from HS.nn&amp;#x200B;nnI agree i see ppl with better social skills as well but giving up is the worst you can do. I want to give up often but instead i come here and read what other ppl write then i get this fired up feeling and i think ""i cant leave things the way they are now i cant keep being alone"" i made a resolution to make friends in 2019 and i havent given up yet the more i fuck up the more determined i am to get it right next time it sucks so bad i get angry with myself for not saying anything to the person who smiled at me or whatever but its making me more determined to stop overthinking things and throwing myself out there im going to make a fool out of myself but better to do that then to instead of give up on myself and wallowing in my social anxiety then id start self medicating and become depressed again. It would be a repeat of my last year of highschool only difference would be that now i am an adult who has been out of highschool for several years :) No way do i want to experience those feelings again i would give anything to not feel like i did back then highschool had me fucked up or rather SA had me fucked in highschool"
igb5qm,"I have a physical condition that attracts unwanted attention and it's awful..... **TLDR at the end!** I'm a 22 year old male college student finishing up my senior year, and should be on my way to transition to my professional career as soon as this coronavirus craziness dies down and allows for the amount of travelling the job involves. I'm a movie fanatic, dabble in PC gaming (although I could really use some new hardware), and enjoy most outdoor activities like camping and hiking. I'm 6'1"" and about 170lbs, reasonably athletic, and *try* to dress well. I try to keep my life as average as possible. I don't go out of my way to seek attention, usually I'm happy to just do my own thing and let others do their. Well, life decided that was too much to ask for and decided to throw me a curve ball. Ever since puberty kicked off, I've been developing into a man at a rate of about 1/16th of an inch a month.... go ahead and reread that, fire up your calculator, whatever you need to do. My doctor can't find anything medically wrong with me, and all my blood work checks out. As far as he can tell this is just how I am. He's prepared me for the possibility that things may not slow down or stop until my mid-20s, although this would be rare. But OP! That sounds like an absolute blessing and a dream come true for hundreds of people!! You should be thankful!! Yeah well... it was fun at first, but when you have to wake up every day and face the world, all sorts of things get inconvenient very quickly. There a dozens of issues I have to manage that most people don't seem to have to think about. Buying clothes is a nightmare. Exercise is uncomfortable. Sex and dating is a disaster. And the big one... society and people in general. Society loves, *loves*, ***loves***, to obsess over this topic. Guys brag to anyone who will listen, truthful or not. Girls brag to their friends. Jokes are made everywhere. Media, especially music, won't shut up about it. All sorts of products promising to give you one are marketed universally. There are even categories of videos online dedicated to it. ...and yet it is still a taboo topic to seriously discuss with nearly anyone, at least in the USA. NO ONE seems willing to accept it may not be the most wonderful thing to ever happen to a person. But you won't even get that far because no one will believe you in the first place if you bring it up. I've been harassed, groped, ogled, sneakily photographed, lost friends, dumped or refused by partners or potential partners, and caught in the middle of drama all because of it. I hate the attention it brings. But people are SO stuck on the idea that it is a wonderful thing and can't possibly have any downsides that I've yet to find a single trustworthy person who's given me the time of day and just listened to me or let me rant or wanted to try and understand what I go through. So I just bottle it up inside and try to move on with my life and pretend it isn't a source of anxiety for me. **TLDR: I've grown about 1/16th of an inch (yes...there) a month since puberty started (I'm 22 now) and it's more of a curse than a blessing. Society disagrees with me on that so the stress and issues it creates for me get bottled up inside, which isn't healthy for my mental state and makes me feel like an outsider, freakshow, whatever you wanna call it.** So... thanks for making it this far and if you'd like to AMA then please do. Honestly anything, as long as it's respectful and genuine, will help take some of this stress off my shoulders at this point. I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to move on past this hang up in my life? I have no idea how to handle this in a positive manner that doesn't result in fucking up relationships with friends, family, and partners. It just doesn't seem like something most people are willing to give the time of day and legitimacy to. It's incredibly frustrating as well because as an introverted person, **I don't want the attention.** This has become a pretty major source of anxiety in my life and I have no idea how to avoid it."
ow7twz,Why do bullies just randomly hit you with harsh words when you don't even know them and never spoke to them in your life?. I'm going into 8th grade now but back in 6th There was this stupid kid who would randomly just come up to me and call me trash. and one time in gym we were practicing tennis hitting a ball on the wall back and fourth with a racket and my ball fell and rolled towards him and i had my hand out awkwardly standing their but he just sat their holding my ball with a evil smirk on his grin. why do people feel the need to just go up to innocent quiet people minding their own business and ruin their day? that kid bullied me back in 6th grade but almost 2 years later I still think back on it. Why don't people just bully people who did something bad to them? why bully some one you don't even know?
dk8ttsp," Wow.... this is the nicest comment Ive ever received. You're willing to help me through this? Even though I'm just a stranger to you?? ...maybe life isn't as desolate as I once thought... Thank you. And haha thank you for the compliment! About the weight loss, one day I was just disgusted with how I looked. So that day I limited myself to 1300 calories. And then the next day. And so on, and I've been sticking to it every day since. Now I've lost 30 pounds and I've still got 26 more to go before I'm considered ""normal weight"". So... baby steps, huh? A 10 minute walk... I guess I could try that... and you said you'll help push me for more? I hope that's a promise! Thank you for being so kind. "
rp7brb," DAE feel on edge constantly?. I feel constantly stressed in a way that nothing fixes. I almost feel like I need to scream but I know it wouldn’t really help. It makes me act irritable to my partner which makes me feel worse. Meds, weed, alcohol are just short term fixes. Can’t do any real cardio exercise because of chronic pain (I could prob swim but there’s nowhere close to me). I feel like I need to do something with my body that just isnt physically possible. "
f4thn4s," Yeah. We were originally planning on going to a park since fall is starting to come in nicely. But she wasn't free until after the sun goes down... so I'm thinking maybe the philly art museum? They have a special Wednesday night thing. Not really my thing, and not sure if it's hers either but it could give some interesting stuff to talk about? Philly actually does have an axe throwing place haha. She was saying last time throwing isnt really her strong suit so maybe I'll save crushing her at that for later :P "
bqkzml," Im a worthless people chaser piece of shit, i dont have a personality. No good qualties. I want to end my fucking life.. Y'all say self improvment is the key but i dont know where to start.. would self improvment or stop chasing approval would fix any of those below? :/ im so fucking angry while everyone is improving and taking advices while i cant do either. Im fuckingggggggg worthless. Pointless. Dont have a brain. Cant fucking improve my self.. its like i dont want to admit that i dont have any good qualities. Its hard to do. I hate seeing people who improved. I get jealous. I feel like crying like a bitch. I cant stop putting women on pedestal for their pussy i cant even talk to them i see them like FUCKING GODS. Most say love your first or work on your self first etc... i still absolutely hate my self...cause Im not cool, im invisible, im lame af, im boring, i dont have confidence, low self esteem, chasing approval, im not charismatic, not assertive, ambition, sense of humour, positivity, girls dont want me... no one wants me, aint important to nobody im not witty, i dont have humour, i dont have my own opinions, im a brainless pathetic dude, so no one loves me, im not charming, im not intelligent or smart, im a bitch r/niceguys worst kind of people... and i dont know how to fix any of this shit.. i dont have any fucking masculane traits. I dont know how to hold a convo with people mostly girls, i dont know how to make friends, i dont know what stuff to talk abkut or what topics... i dont know how to be interested in people.. i purely want to be interested in them but approval seeking/being boring from me doesnt give me a chance to get to fucking even know them... My convos are mostly boring topics, (school, soccer, politics, religion,) like how the fuck lovers live 3-4 years together and they talk everyday about something? I will never have a GF bc i cant do that, i run out of things to say. People dont care to talk to me. So i will never meet any girl, im bad at small talk, at the start of meeting new people im scared of what im gonna say.. cause they might not like it or thought its boring or stupid. And i always chase other people for validation to make me feel worthy or im good enough or im a cool person.. but i always get ignored and end up beating my self up. I always based my self on how many Rts and likes i got.. i would cry and feel unimportant when others would get it.. and would think they have everything that i dont have. Most i was obssessed with was girls. I was invisible:(.. I also chase them because im desperate for attention and friends, i dont have anyone that thinks im important at all, nd my parents have their own issues.. I see others having friends and girls chasing them i compare my self to them like an idiot and i look at others like they are fucking gods.. and my opinions arent imporant enough.. I dont have any interesting ideas or opinions. My mind isnt creative like that. My most convos are like an interview, the other person gets bored and just gives me on word replies.. My only goals now are getting a GF or my hobby is porn..im lazy af. I dont know who i am or i dont know who should i be, im lost, i dont know what the fuck to do anymore.. Most you all say to do hobbies. Well i live in a towm called Harir in Kurdistan/iraq its a small towm only hobby is soccer and other is Gym I dont have money for it. And most jobs suck ass here. And therapists arent available here.. iraq is 4th most curropted country in world.. something like a therapist wont be here. I want to move out oneday.. "
d9aseq7," I believe I've only begun my journey as I have only recently took steps to improve my SA which has been with me my whole life, but it has been getting worse since I was 18. Just some background info: I've been working full time for about a year now but for the majority of the year all I would do is work, go home, watch videos, sleep and repeat. Since graduating uni, social contact has been minimal. I was so unmotivated to do stuff as working was draining and by the end of the day, all I wanted to do was relax by myself. Fast track to a few months ago, I've started meditating. It might be easy for some people but just doing this everyday was very hard for me as I was used to doing nothing. Meditation has made me a calmer and more mindful person which is reflected in my daily life. It has also made me a more content person and given me more focus. I'm very glad I've kept up this practice up until now. The next step for me is to exercise and maybe find a gym. I've been running and bike riding for some of my days off and I would always feel great and energized afterwards. Progress is slow I admit but I needed to be comfortable and happy with myself before I can start to socialize more. I've found that the more happier I am, the more likely I am to greet people and listen to what they have to say, which is sounds simple enough but I've only just realized this. I've got a long way to go but I'm glad I've started to take small steps. Everything you've posted is relate-able to me and I think a lot of others can benefit from your wise words :) "
frx65r, Just did my anual small talk with my neighbour. I got outside to let my dog take a dump and my neighbour was there too. I couldn't escape this time. The talk was nice and i didn't embarrass myself but still when i got back inside my shirt was soaked in sweat lmao. It is hard folks. 
qifu6n," I'm an experienced meditator with SA. AMA. Thought I might contribute better to this community. I've been meditating for almost 6 years now. On and off. Probably have at least a couple thousand hours behind me. Even wrote a book about meditation that I published on Amazon, but deleted cos I thought it wasn't good enough. I thought I might give basic information about meditation and if you have any questions, ask right away. Meditation is fairly simple. You can meditate anytime, anywhere as long as your full attention isn't needed. Work or driving a car would belong to this category. Otherwise, you're good to go. Having a gym session, cooking, walking in the park, riding public transportation are all excellent opportunities to build that meditation muscle. Of course, you can do old-fashioned traditional meditation as well. Make sure you sit comfortably, in a chair or cross-legged on the floor and put a timer, starting with as little as 5 minutes. It's important that you keep still here. Sitting upright will prevent you from falling asleep. You can keep your eyes open or close them, it's your choice. There is only one thing you have to do. Concentrate on the present. Some people like to count their breaths, others just stare into what's around them. You can concentrate on sensations in your body or a noise or whatever cathces your attention. The only important thing is you're outside of your head. That's why doing something mechanical usually helps since you can concentrate on your actions exclusively. You will be pulled back into thoughts and worries quite easily. In the beginning, you might only spent your whole time invested in thought. That's alright. Whenever you catch yourself thinking, shift your attention outwards, in the world around you. Or inwards, towards your own body. Try to hold your attention away from thoughts as much as possible. If you just can't let go of a thought, don't worry. Try to finish it and then again try to shift your attention away from your thoughts and towards something in your present experience. The two biggest problems with meditation are boredom and frustration. At first meditation is like torture. You just don't want to do it. It helps a good couple of months to ease yourself into it and then a year to start seeing some benefits. The important thing is that you stick with it. Try to make it a daily practice. Remember, it's not important that you stay present, it's important that you try. It's still successful if you attempt to meditate. tl;dr - I've just explained a basic meditation practice. If you have other questions, feel free to ask. "
fseod6x, I avoid mirrors and put my head down when I walk outside incase i pass a reflective surface lol. got that fun life ;P 
nxvg2j, i just went for a bike ride!!. I just got back from a bike ride and i’ve been putting off going outside to do stuff for so long. I was scared cause it’s night even though i live in a really safe town but everything was fine and I feel so happy I did it and just feel really energized and it kind of reminded me that I can find joy in being by myself cause I don’t have friends lmao. But I look forward to doing it tomorrow and i’m pretty proud of myself! :) 
fhilryk,"Thanks for this^ The only thing though, my anxiety is in everything atm. I can’t even watch a movie normally. I just feel very constantly bad in general. I’m constantly busy with what I think and how I feel. I’m suffering 24/7. I’m super afraid I have something else then just social anxiety and GAD. Walking is tough yes, but well, tomorrow I’ll sit down in my backyard. Even that is not a simple task. I’m just feeling bad because such things aren’t even simple. I hate myself for it. And for what am I doing it? What’s the fun of life? I haven’t had any happiness in years. I even don’t know how it feels anymore. Is it worth it? Idk."
d2ko0eh," Have you tried therapy? I started with talking therapy and I felt like a HUGE weight was lifted off my shoulders once I talked to someone. I'm doing a lot better now... but I have self referred to a CBT service just to take it that lil bit further Taking long walks in busy places helped me out too. I started to feel used to being around people... so I'd say try that out... though it's hard, you really can do it :) Though SA is a total bitch, you can message me whenever saying as much or as little as you want. Keep on going "
m2cgyr,"Today or tomorrow?. Hi there Turning 17 has really been a reality chok.  I've had (self diagnosed) social anxiety for as long as I can remember. As a child, I always watched the other children being and playing together while I stood by the side and felt jealous. My self esteem was very fragile, and my self confidence practically did not exist. I knew as a child that I would regret not doing more, not taking some kind of initiative. But I also thought ""Hey, I have tomorrow. Today I am just gonna endure, but tomorrow I'll do something about it"". Tomorrow became next week, and next week became next month. Next month became next year, and next year became next decade. And here I am. At 17 years old, having wasted more than a decade on... Nothing. I never got to play football with the other kids, never got to play videogames with them, never got to play in the fields with them, never went to the beach with them, never got to feel like I belonged. Never truly got to feel that I lived. Video games and playing in the fields got replaced by parties and hanging out. When I went home from school, I would spend my afternoons and evenings at home with my family or alone, while my peers would go to each other's places and having a good time together. Often they would go to parties with each other, being immature, exploring their sexualities and in general just having the times of their lives. Meanwhile I'd sit indoors at home, doing nothing, and even feeling sorry for myself. Now I've reached a certain age, where I have concluded that there is no tomorrow. We never live tomorrow. We always live today. I have always consciously known this, I just never haven't done anything about it, because unconsciously I'd always think ""Well, there IS tomorrow"". But no, there isn't. Only today is. Only NOW is. I know you've been told this a thousand times, but it is true. Don't wait understanding it till it's too late. I will never be able to do the things I was so jealous of in my childhood. Never, EVER. It's gone. I know. I'm only 17, so I have all of life ahead of me, so I can't complain. But no, if I continue thinking ""But I still have tomorrow"", tomorrow will become next week, next week will be next month, next month will be next year, next year will be next decade, and BAM, next decade will be in death. So do something about it NOW!! Contact a therapist if you haven't already. And I mean, really, DO IT!  One day you'll wake up wrinkled, weak and tired. That day will be very soon, trust me. Imagine this: You are 73 years old. You have no friends or family. But wrinkles you got a lot of. You look at yourself in the mirror and think ""Where did all these years go?"". Well, you wasted them on thinking that you always had tomorrow. You think back on those times when you were just a teenager. Ah, being a teenager. Being around with friends and living life. But you never got to do that, because you always had tomorrow. Then you think about your twenties. Ah, the twenties. The time of exploring the world and yourself. But you never did that, because you always had tomorrow. Then you reminisce your thirties. Ah, the thirties and forties. Getting a family and enjoying life. But you never did that, because you always had tomorrow. Then your fifties and sixties, the time of relaxing and enjoying life with your family and friends. But you never did that, because you always had tomorrow. And here you are at 73. Thinking about the past and what you could have done. Ah, what could have been. You will be entering your grave with the memories of a lost life. A life without life. Because you never truly lived. But then! A fairy comes and gives you the most precious gift of them all; the opportunity to return back time! You get the chance to relive your life!  What would you do different this time? Would you still just say ""But I still have tomorrow""? I hope that you not just got my point, but also that you would start doing something with your life, and that you won't let your social anxiety ruin the most precious thing you have. Life... Have a nice day"
e9pqf0m," Ding ding ding. That's it. Also, I act like a tough guy around but if someone tried to speak with me i would crumble like a sand castle. "
fszw541," maybe a way to avoid this is to make the first move before he can ask that question? i know that seems pretty hard too. but if you can think of a first date that seems more suited to you, try asking him about it! hey, i heard about this park in your town, want to go for a walk? or hey, theres this movie im dying to show you, want to get some takeout at your place and watch? i have the exact same problem as you. for me some of my anxiety comes with the fact that i dont drink, and i think that can make me seem pretty uncool. but just remember youve been talking to this guy for six months, one small interaction of you saying ""im pretty uncomfortable in a bar setting, want to try something else instead?"" isnt going to make him dislike you. have you been open to him about your social anxiety? we are often ashamed of it but we have to try to not be. if you hope the relationship goes anywhere, you may have to be open about it sooner or later. im sure he will be more than willing to be accommodating! and if not, hes not worth your time. you got this, i believe in you "
jiioki,Hate others. Wish I could just snap all humans away for like a day or 2 so I could go outside for a nice walk without seeing them. Go to the park without having anxiety. Go anywhere without seeing others. I wanna live in an empty town. Ghost town.
67ofzv,Decided to really challenge myself today. I'm going to go to my local professional baseball team's game today BY MYSELF. I'm going to try to talk to people around me. I figure fans of the same team will give me an excuse to try to start talking to them. I'll let you know how it goes. Edit 1: thanks everyone for the kind regards! I'll be back on here with how it went seeing that I survive it. Edit 2: it went so well everyone! I met someone from the opposing team's city and it was fun! I even made it on tv a few times because I was so close to the field
fn7ilmy,"Yeah, I mean I dont know how it feels like being arround friends / being outside anymore so honestly I dont care about my anxiety. As long Iam home its all fine. The only reason I go to things / therapy is for my parents and brother not to get mad at me. I cant handle anything. Its great that it is possible to commit suicide as it gives me peace that there is always a way out. I'm not really thinking of doing anything to myself but that thought just helps me. I hope god is with me. Its so hard to believe in god when you havent been anywhere for a year but god still managed to reach me. I'm not 100% that god is real, but I hope it will be my way to inner peace and a happy life. Happy easter my friend :) I should stop feeling sorry myself as well. I always help people and giveback to people and that is why I feel sad for myself in what kinda position I'm in now but in reality Iam the one that stopped going to school and gave up on my life on this round star in the universe."
di0leqz," This is positive on so many levels: connecting with friends, getting into nature and connecting with the outside world, chatting, getting sun (i.e. vitamin D which raises testosterone and serotonin and makes u feel good), and the possibility of the gym. I'm a MASSIVE proponent of physical exercise to overcome anxiety and I would HIGHLY recommend going with your friend if u can. Failing that, any regular exercise u can do by yourself would also be good. Anyway, good on u bro, nice to hear of your positive day "
pvi813, Im feeling so anxious please help me im surrounded by people. Im gonna die or something I’m so anxious right now I’m at a party outside surrounded by people I was sitting with my cousin but then this girl Who knows my cousin came and sat with us and she’s talking to her so I feel awkward and there also people inside so I dont know what to do or where to go 
eb2tbab," Sushi sounds good. happy birthday :) and I feel ya, My last bday got wasted and cried a bunch in my backyard. I'm going to try and make this one better. even if it's just out treating myself. hope your next b-day is a good one "
5lay8l," Another year wasted due to SA.... I have't done anything for myself this year.I remember that last December i went to a store and got some gym equipment because i wanted to start working out and improving myself,so i can somewhat raise my self-esteem,which is almost 0.That equipment has been sitting untouched and unused for a year now. Academically i do well,but bad at self improvement.I would have rather had the other way around and be happier with myself. On last year's new eve i made a wish to get a gf,but i was wrong;i realized that i cannot meet a girl until i am truly satisfied with myself and raise my confidence.If i don't like myself how can someone else do so? The wish for this year will be to become better and hopefully i will finally start working out(not specifically to find a partner,for myself),but i find it very hard to get the motivation and get to action because i have an unhealthy habit to feel inferior to people that are in better shape than me and think ""i'm never going to reach that point"" because i feel stupid when i start something new,especially if i'm alone in a room with multiple people that are much better than me because of their experience. I used to do swimming when i was a kid and i was good at it.The biggest mistake was quitting because high school admission exams were coming and i have lost the drive.As an effect of quitting swimming i gained some weight, i have developed SA due to some crappy experiences with people, and lost all my self esteem on the way.From that point on my life went down spiral. I feel stuck in a ditch and i can't seem to be able to make myself get out of it.I wish i could extend my foot and give myself a hard kick in the ass to start being productive again,but unfortunately i cannot physically do that,but mentally,which is the hardest part. It's like there is a fight in my head:while my rationale tells me to sign up to a gym,my emotional side keeps me from doing it.. If anybody could give me some advice or motivation,i would strongly appreciate it :) Anyway,happy new year to all of you and hopefully 2017 will bring something better to us! "
fy49bpa," I am 22, and I can completely relate. You shared your story, so I’ll share a bit of mine. I hope that you can find some comfort in it. When I was in my senior year of high school, I was so sick of all the work that went towards picking out a college. So I took one visit to the college I ended up choosing, and I was like, “Yeah, I like it well enough, I’ll just go here.” But I wasn’t really sure about my decision, and because of my anxiety I was miserable for much of the time that I spent there. So, when I was around 20, I decided to take time off from school, and find a job. Only my job experience wasn’t in retail like yours, I was a tennis pro at a tennis club. As you might imagine, that was a very stressful time for me. I, as a person with social anxiety, was trying to prove myself (mostly because I was so young compared to my coworkers) and a lot of days were very stressful. It started out as something of an internship. I worked the first month or so without pay, but I eventually proved that I was a capable enough pro and started to get paid. The pay was pretty good, and in many cases I was able to overcome my anxiety and I met some wonderful people and had some really fun nights coaching and helping run tournaments and events. But after about 6 months, I started to really get anxious again, and it started to become where every day was a struggle, mostly just due to social interactions. I felt the urge to explore going back to school again. And two months later, I decided that that was exactly what I wanted to do. And I have been successful in junior college, and now I’m planning on transferring to a four-year university once again starting in 2021. And I feel much more happy and confident about it this time around because I had that break. I tell you all of this because I read your post and it really seems to me that you are at a similar point that I was in my life just three years ago. I know that you said that you think you are using going back to school as an excuse to leave your retail job, but I believe that you should really consider that possibility. Also, my friend, realize this: it is perfectly okay to take time off if you really need it to figure out what in the world you’re going to do! I wish someone told me that when I was in a similar situation to yourself. I feel as though society pushes the narrative that as an 18/19 year old kid that you have to have everything together and have your life all planned out, but the reality is it doesn’t work that way. I have learned in my short time on this earth that we basically are going to spend our entire lives figuring things out. And I don’t think you should worry about “mooching” off your parents either. Hopefully, your parents love you, and they signed up for this when they had you. It’s their job to help you, and that includes monetarily. So just do your best to relax about that. And my friend, I hated hearing this just a few years ago when I was your age: but you are just 19. Don’t be afraid to take some time off, and my advice would be to really appreciate the “basics” in life again, especially your relationships with family and friends. Count your blessings, and see where you can improve. Push yourself out of your comfort zone as often as you can. I’ve learned that that is the best way to overcome SA. And definitely, definitely consider seeing a psychiatrist and getting on medication. I’m on medication, and I can assure you that it really helps once you find the right meds, and you could also perhaps consider coupling the meds with regular visits with a psychologist or social worker. Try your best to do all of these things, and then consider going back to school or work. Sorry, I know that this post is a bit long, but I wanted to give you as much as I can, because trust me, I’ve been in a similar situation. I hope this helps you! :) "
qsui6e,"Just bought some noise cancelling in ear headphones. It makes being in public so much easier.. I love skating and walking through my city, but unfortunately, being a major city, there are so many people around. And as my little part of the world exits our lockdown period, the amount of people is rising. Back to feeling absolutely swamped by people and overwhelmed by the amount of noise and voices. Especially today. I had been considering it for a while, but sitting in a cafe and not being able to hear (through my shitty 35 mm jack apple headphones) the music I use to calm down was kind of it for me. Clinking of plates and glasses, squeaking chairs, people talking, etc. They were more than I'd really ever want to spend on headphones but HOLY CRAP is it ever so nice to have so much noise just...gone. unless there are some Muppets having a conversation on the table next to me, people are silent. The clatter and clank of seats and shit, gone. The gross ambient noise of crowds I skate through, gone. It. Is. Beautiful. I was starting to regress a little but with noise sensitivity. When I was 5 ish, loud music and sudden short but loud noises were enough to set me off, crying a little bit, wanting to hide somewhere. 15ish years later, sudden sharp and loud noises were starting to make me wince again, and I was beginning to need to take a few seconds to just kind of recompose myself. I moved out not long ago, and 50% of rhe reason was that my family viewed my sensitivity to noises like that to be unreasonable and didn't really care to put plates and mugs away more carefully. These noise cancelling headphones make those kinds of noises immediately so much easier to deal with. It's so, so, so nice."
ice1r4," I hate feeling like this. I don't even know what's wrong with me. Every single interaction I have, every single thing I think of saying fills me with dread and doubt. After I say one sentence, I spiral into self-loathing and anxiety. I hate this. I'm better. I'm a lot better than how I used to be. I didn't talk to anyone unless I was spoken to for the six years. Even then, I'd give generic responses or short answers. I was too anxious to even go outside in the past, I was too anxious to even buy things. I can at least somewhat talk to people now, even if I might be somewhat weird or awkward. That's better than saying nothing, than being a walking corpse. But it's still hard now. I've started college this week, and everything I felt in the past has just come back, and it's come back a lot stronger. I feel like crying and throwing up most of the day. I don't even know what I'm doing. I don't even know what I'm supposed to do. I'm just talking to random people even though I don't want to. I don't even know how all those conversations will transform into friendships, because the few friends I've ever had were all made in unconventional ways. I'm not supposed to think about what I'm supposed to say, but that's so fucking hard. How do I even improve? How do I know if I'm saying or acting the right way if I don't think about it? For the people who are legitimately weird/awkward while having SA -- are they supposed to remain in social ineptitude for the rest of their lives? And you know what's worse? Not actually knowing if what I said was awkward/weird or not. I'm trying to say everything that first comes to mind and it makes me feel terrible. I really can't help but feel like a complete dumbass. But what other choice do I have? What else can I do? All I can hope is that all I'm feeling and doing now has a point, that, I might feel like shit for a few weeks, months, or maybe for all of university, but that it's worth something. That I'll be able to change at \*some point\*, no matter when that is. I wouldn't be able to live the way I am forever. Just wanted to vent. Thanks if anyone reads all of this. "
g1p3ivp,"Today I was in the park for my daily run and this guy who looked older than me by like 7 years or so I’m (15 btw), and I was warming up to run he was jogging past me and was like come let’s jog together at first I had my headphone on and just wanted to run my daily 5k, but then I started to jog next to him and we was asking each other questions he asked me how long I’ve been running for and other stuff. He was actually so nice and he also helped me run my fastest ever run but I stopped at 5k because that was my goal and he kept going. I don’t why but it was so easy to talk to him I don’t know if I was just in the mood to be social or what, but anyway it was a nice experience. If and only if he wasn't trying to date you or anything like that, you did the right thing. I suggest that in situations that look like this at the start, they are generally not trying to date you."
enjrewg, To stop obsessing over wanting people (mainly girls) to like you. Desperation is never good. You need to find other things to focus on. Maybe try to find some new hobbies. Put your energy into soccer instead of chasing girls your parents won't let you date. You might even find some girls to play soccer with or something. People have stuff to talk about when they do things together. If it's not possible for you to meet up with them it's no wonder why you have nothing to talk about. My understanding of dating apps and whatnot is that you send a few messages back and forth to make sure you aren't totally incompatible then set up a date. I just know that I am young and have plenty of time to grow as a person. And we grow through experiences. I don't need validation from other people to know that I am a capable person. 
dh6m1sh," I've never been to one. I think a meetup for the ""socially disadvantaged"" (seems like an excuse). It would be so awkward but maybe not. What are you guys doing? I just do stuff alone and see if I fit in with people. I hike/ski/attend music festivals/disc golf alone and for the most part I stay alone but sometimes I meet someone to spend the day with. I still go with some of my old work friends from time to time but I have gotten to the point where I really don't care if I do stuff alone. I will be skydiving soon which I really hope to enjoy. "
f7tzya5," No you should eat somewhere more serene, without so many people, like in the park. You don't have to go out of your comfort zone all the time to prove you're worthy of society?!?Hey, you are you, and you have some specific preferences like all of us, and I respect that. So you're introverted? Great, that means you'll make true friends, extroverts have to deal with a lot of fakers who are just there for the free stuff, it's a hell hole, and you don't wanna be there when it all comes crashing. Also people who know how sensible and normal introverts are, are gonna be your friends, and they'd be the most wonderful people of all. People who don't mind any physical trait. You don't seek normal stuff, you seek the perfect harmony, every other introvert I meet acts that way. They're not looking for the next juicy topics to gossip to, they're looking to create the perfect circumstances/plot that they deem themselves to experience. It's the most beautiful of causes, it's breathtaking. "
g71rlnn," Ah, well I was gonna suggest a custodian until you said no poop. Still, there are all sorts of custodial jobs out there, like lawn mowers for instance. And speaking from experience, you get used to the poo pretty quick. Garbage collector might be a really good one. Sure the job is smelly and has very early hours, but the pay is usually pretty great and at the worst there's a second person riding with you on your route. Depending on where you live, your city's waste management company might have newer more automated trucks that only require a driver. Trucking is pretty much the epitome of loner careers, but it is not a low-maintenance job and may take you far from home depending on the kind of job you get. Computer Science and other IT jobs are a popular choice for those with social anxiety since nearly all communication is done online usually. But, you also usually need a degree or some type of training program, and will have to deal with bosses/customers who truly do have unrealistic standards. Finally, my chosen profession, security. Like with custodial/maintenance jobs, security can be a mixed bag, but if you're a night owl, there are many opportunities to quietly guard a building overnight all by yourself, the only time you see people being at shift change and maybe to occasional workaholic or cleaner. Even when it comes to day jobs, a lot of them just require you to stand or sit at a desk all day and be a visible presence without any real expectations. The downside is security guards do not get paid very well. Still, there's no degree or whatnot needed, there's pretty much always overtime available if you want, and it sure beats being a cashier. "
5n1zdu,"Need recommendations for coach to help with conversations.. Im 24 never had any friends and live in a very rural part of the country so I've never been to parties, parks are non existent. nnnI am confident in myself and have no problem talking to people or putting a smile on and saying hi to strangers.nnnMy Issue is I have nothing to talk about and cant keep a conversation going. I don't have many options or time to go and simply practice with people in the real world. nnnI need a personal Online Coach one on one to hash out my issues.nnnAny recommendations that I can look into.   Thanks  "
fzfgdhe," Eye contact. Like, I can only make eye contact with people who I am comfortable around or who I've know for long enough. But making eye contact with strangers on the street/school hall/etc? Absolutely not! I basically stare at my phone almost all the time when I'm outside alone. Obviously I avoid other stuff aswell but that's one of the main things. Good luck with writing your stories (or a book)! Maybe you could share it once it's done "
eo805s1," Mixture of loneliness, desperation and sudden waves of ‘feeling normal’ after I started taking anxiety medication. I thought having a girlfriend would fill the void, but thinking about it, that’s not healthy to be dependent on someone else for happiness so I’ve been trying to focus on myself first. "
g6cw54z," I’m 23 (f) and have been in therapy since grade 9, so almost 10 years now. It honestly completely changed my life. Therapy takes a lot of commitment and hard work, and at first it may seem like things are just getting worse and not better. Stick with it though, it gets worse because you’re finally talking about all these horrible anxieties you have that you’ve been pushing down for years so naturally it’s gonna be hard when they finally come up. It also may take awhile to work, but don’t be mad at yourself about that. It’s one step forward, two steps back as with most new habits you try to form. But honestly, do it! Do it do it do it! I can’t express it enough over how amazing therapy is! I did CBT for about 5 years, that really laid the foundation for me and I feel like it completely changed the wiring of my brain. It was a lot of cognitive exercises and teaching you techniques for how to combat the anxiety. At first it can seem really annoying to do these things, I definitely felt that way at first, but now looking back I realized that all I use all those techniques everyday and that they’ve made my life 1000 times more bearable. I now do DBT, which is often used for those with borderline personality disorder but is helpful to anyone who feels emotions very intensely. It basically teaches you how to deal with the extreme waves of emotion/anxiety that will overwhelm you and stop you from being able to function. I recommend CBT for someone who is just starting out though. Remember, it’s important to find a therapist you click with. It can take a few tries with different people, but don’t stop if it takes awhile. If you don’t click with someone that’s okay. Once you find someone you like, it will still be hard work, but having someone you click with and who genuinely cares about you makes all the difference. "
ea2eqqv," I mostly feel nothing. Sometimes I get angry at myself for a few seconds for being such a piece of shit, then I quickly go back to being numb. &amp;#x200B; I'm becoming an alcoholic because of my depression, and from my personal experience so far it's only good on the short term, but addiction to alcohol is really bad. I've stopped drinking for over a week now and I also started taking antidepressants, but I can't really say how much it helped. What I can say however is that although interacting with people is very hard for me, i always feel better when I successfully manage to have a casual talk with someone. Being locked in my room doing nothings for days straight is something I'm very good at, but I know it's extremely detrimental to my mental state. I don't like school because it forces me to be surrounded for hours by people I'm usually too shy to even try to talk to and listening to a lecture I usually don't care about at all, but it also gives me the opportunity to communicate with other people, which is hard but does happen in group work. I mean I don't talk that much at all, but it's still infinitely more than alone in my bedroom thinking about my life and getting regularly overwhelmed by waves of sadness, nostalgia and self-hatred. "
d0qph5c," Just hang in there. Sure, how people treat you is based on how you look, but you can always change the way you look. Hell, if you wanted, you could even go get plastic surgery (wouldn't recommend it though, just throwing out ideas). There are a few subs I've been following ever since I made a commitment to better myself and my body. I'm sure there are quite a large number of guys like you browsing them: /r/Fitness /r/Bodyweightfitness /r/gainit /r/Supplements /r/nutrition I tend to browse /r/bodyweightfitness. What's great about bodyweight exercise/calisthenics is you can do most of the work in the comfort of your own home. So if you're scared of working out in the gym, BWF is definitely an option. If you want to invest more in BWF, buy a pair of calisthenic rings and a pull-up bar. They're pretty cheap investments (compared to a full set of weights + a bench, that is) that will help you in the long run. "
emvw0r,"nobody understands how much i’m struggling :(. so i’m not diagnosed with social anxiety but it runs in my family and my councillor has told me that it is very likely that i have got social anxiety and agoraphobia too. i dropped out of school and college because i struggled to go in and hardly ever actually went. i worked at my family business but it recently closed down so i lost my job. im now at a point where i literally never leave my house anymore. i’m too scared to get a job, i can’t cope with college, i’ve lost contact with practically all my friends, i can’t even walk my down down the road. i’m 16 so i live at home with my mum and i feel like she just doesn’t acknowledge how much i’m struggling. she came into my room today and said “im going to bed now” it was pretty early so i said “already!” and she made the comment “yes i’m stressed out and ive had a shit day. maybe when your older you’ll understand.” when she left i just burst out crying because today marks a year since i tried to commit suicide and its like she doesn’t even remember it happened. my twin brother has OCD and when he was struggling she took him to get help and a diagnosis straight away. why am i not getting the help i need? i’m sick of it. i’m just getting worse and worse every day."
fzhbs1u," I'm crushed by loneliness and depression. Most days I hang on by a thread. I have never felt more alone. My summer has been horribly uneventful despite believing it was going to be amazing. I haven't been doing much of anything besides reading, riding my bike or watching shows. I started a new job that has sent my anxiety to sky high levels and I don't know how much more I can tolerate. I'm so sad and alone. "
7ccno4,"Loneliness is my God-given Destiny. Went to a new bar they'd opened up in town last night. Paid $11 for a beer, but it wasn't all that bad cause I got a free coke, and the security were happy to put my backpack away. &amp;nbsp; Yes, I'd actually brought a backpack into a bar .. cause I hadn't really intended to go out that night, I'd just taken the bus home from a buddy's house .. and as soon as I saw some flashing lights and heard some loud bass down the road, I had an irresistible urge to push 'STOP' and walk out. I mean, why not.. it's Saturday night, and I'm lonely as hell.. right..? &amp;nbsp; The first bar I'd been to had a bit of a douchy atmosphere to it. It's always the bars that have that 'rock'n roll / hippie / punk' cliche going on, that seem to cater to the most judgmental and stuck up breed of people, ironically. &amp;nbsp; I sat down at a random table with some girls, and the girls asked me 'Do you know my friend?' to which I replied: 'No, no .. I mean, I just came here by myself hoping to meet some people?' &amp;nbsp; I walked out of the bar and started walking aimlessly around town, unsure whether I wanted to use up my remaining bus money to catch a ride back home, or keep looking for a place with decent vibes. &amp;nbsp; Finally I'd decided to check out the new bars they opened up along the river, something I'd been conspiring to do for almost half a year. There were people queuing in line, so I presumed it would have to be good. I struck up a conversation with an 18 year old guy who'd come from Britain, and we had a nice chat about movies, college .. ... our home countries .... blah blah blah. Really cool dude, actually.. &amp;nbsp; By the time we'd sat down at the stools, I had to tell him that I was attracted to women. I had to explain to him that I wasn't 'friendzoning' him because, well. I was telling the truth. So we both agreed to go on a challenge that night; Find a cute lady to spend the night with. &amp;nbsp; Anywhoo. You probably already know how that ended .. &amp;nbsp; ..After 4 year of going to bars looking for girls and always walking out alone every time, I can attest to the fact that bars and nightclubs are not a good place to meet girls. Neither is college. Nor is it he supermarket, or Tinder. &amp;nbsp; I don't even wanna talk about Tinder, let alone those weird girls on there trying to invite me to join their stupid Polyamorous relationships. How is it possible for people to Not be happy with just one partner? I'd give the world just to be able to experience a single relationship, so it really makes my blood boil every time I got a message from one of those girls. &amp;nbsp; There's just nothing I can do to escape this loneliness. Everyone else I know is getting married, buying houses.. but me. I'm economically and psychologically and socially.. still a 12 year old. &amp;nbsp; I guess it's all my fault. I'm 24, didn't have many friends in high school, am attracted to girls.. have a cat.. go to college studying IT.. spend a lot of time on the internet.. eat noodles for breakfast.. drink alone at night. I program. I animate. I hate television.. except for Breaking Bad, and Mr. Robot.. &amp;nbsp; I used to have really bad social anxiety.. but even now, even now that I'm able to order food and speak to strangers at a bar and make them laugh.. even now it's fucking hard just to make a single friend. &amp;nbsp; I don't think this is something that even Therapy will be able to solve. After nearly a decade of trying, I don't think so. Fuck Therapy, it's all just a money-grabbing scheme, lining the pockets of Starbucks-drinking soccer moms and BMW-driving professionals, probably going through a mid-life crisis themselves. &amp;nbsp; I seriously think that God (or some external, cosmological force beyond my control) intended me to be lonely.. to be separate from the rest of the world. There's nothing I can do about it, except work on other aspects of my life in order to compensate for the fact.."
n1zv05,"Started small talk with a stranger today. In recent days I have been outside a lot, because this is where exposure starts for me. It is walking outside, going in stores and just existing in public places while being as relaxed as possible. Now I am leveling up and started talking to people a bit. Like asking basic questions for help, my favourite is ""Do you have a lighter"". Today I did the same thing, I walked up to a guy asked for a ligher and he had one. I noticed that he has injured his hand and asked how the injury happened. From there we had a little talk and I learned his age, what he works and about the injury. I rate the conversation a 5 out of 10. 1 is super nervous akward and 10 would be laughter, relaxation. So yeah it went ok, I like that I did it, I like the questions and interest I showed him and I liked that I knew when to end the conversation. I did not like that I did not laugh at any point and I did not like that my voice did not sound that strong. I am planning to do something like this as often as possible. You just have a great learning effect out of it. You learn that you are more capable than you think, you learn that things most of the time don't go as bad as you expect and of course your anxiety will lessen over time. You just get less sensitive to similar situations. My therapist told me exposure is a key part of overcoming anxiety."
fvlodgf," This was me but I nearly missed a deadline cause I couldn't get myself to walk outside to the car because my neighbor (Zach) was chilling in his garage and he would see me. So I was staring out the window and checking my watch waiting for him to go back inside. Then out of nowhere my other neighbor (Gabriel) arrived home in his suv, on the cell phone,and casually waved at Zach acknowledging his presence. Zach waved back and Gabriel went on to bring in his groceries. I was blown away by how simple that interaction went after I've been putting so much pressure onto it. So that gave me the courage to try it myself and it went just as smoothly as Gabriel's wave. I now wave tf out of all my neighbors to show we cool. Thnx Gabriel "
hr2y2k,"How can I stop being socially awkward... Hello. (Just for context, i am a 14 year old male) I'm here for advice from others if not more... Yesterday, I went to a small lake with a lot of students from my music 'school' (its really small. I would say there were around 35 kids total from ages 8-15) And basically, I had some people that I knew, which I talked with (there were awkward moments though), but it went better than most communication. However, if I tried to talk or be friends with another person, it gets awkward, mostly when their my age and the opposite gender. I just don't know what I should say/do, what my body language should be, and stuff like that. Lmk if you have questions or anything, I'm open to answer..ty in advance!"
ejpv4wb, I watch TV series and play video games all the time it takes my mind off of everything which is why I'm so addicted and I like to go out on bike rides everyday if I can because it puts me in a better mood.. How bad is your social anxiety? 
e5v6ia," Balance &amp; Motion. Anxiety. Agoraphobia. Long message but would greatly appreciate the help. (25M). For as long as I can remember, no matter if it was bouncing chairs, rocking chairs, being rocked back and forth, swinging on a swing, or even taking an elevator in a building, any sort of bouncing, rocking, motion-related things would make me feel nauseous and sick. I was told that as a baby, when I was bouncing in a chair or being rocked back and forth, I would cry - so that was stopped quickly. For all my life, I’ve felt wobbling and rocking sensations (like I’m on a boat) even while sitting still. Putting myself in motion then coming to a stop can magnify that sensation. Later on into childhood, I was doing a lot of skating at hockey rinks and playing hockey. There was one time, when I was around maybe 10-12 years old, I was skating around the rink and all of a sudden got this super numb feeling from head to toe, almost a light-headed feeling, where everything around me felt ‘off’. I rushed off the rink super fast as I felt nervous and it took me several minutes of sitting down in a seat and relaxing until it went away. It’s hard to explain the exact feeling. But it’s just like my brain, body, and surroundings felt off. Moving my arms and body just didn’t feel normal. Even though I loved skating and hockey more than anything, I basically had to be forced to go back and start skating again, as I was too afraid that it would happen again. I did get back into skating and hockey, and several years later, when I was probably around 16, I was in a hockey tournament and it happened once again but this time it was while playing on the rink. Body went completely numb, surroundings felt weird, it felt weird to move my body. Immediately, I took myself off the rink while the game was in play, and people looked at me questioning what I was doing. It was all confusing for me too, as I simply did not understand what was happening or why it was happening again. This feeling I got while playing hockey or skating ultimately led me to quitting the sport I love. Now today, I’m in my mid-20’s, and about a year and a half ago, I started taking a protein bar out with me while in public because there were certain points where I figured my blood sugar maybe just dipped a bit low (felt a tiny bit nervous), I would eat the snack and felt better a few minutes later. Then, at the time, I was taking protonix/pantoprazole (which I took for over 7+ months due to an ulcer), and then came off an antibiotic and steroid (at the end of the protonix) from being sick. I was out in public about exactly a year ago, after finishing those medications, and after eating a big meal, I went into a department store and had a full-blown panic attack for the first time. Now, I’m dealing anxiety and difficultly leaving the house (a bit agoraphobic) since having 2 panic attacks in public. As I look back on different situations in my life where I got anxious, nervous, and/or got this ‘numb-type feeling’ that overtook my body and my surroundings felt off, it was typically while skating, playing hockey, driving in a vehicle, being around a large crowd of people like in a sports arena, or anxiousness led to it and it took a little while to relax and for the sensation to go away. This ‘off-feeling’ still happens here and there (not nearly as prominent as before), but mixed with the current state of anxiousness and difficulty being able to leave the house. I am not asking for diagnoses, but just want to know if anyone has ideas of what this could potentially be, as well as any feedback or tips. I recently read some research on the vestibular system and its relation to anxiety, agoraphobia, balance and motion, and makes me wonder if there is something potentially wrong with that. Thank you for reading this! "
e840hyh," Definitely.. In my indoors fishing pond.., Yeah, right. "
p1lzvd,"School started yesterday, already dying from exhaustion. So yesterday monday the 9th school started for me. I couldn't even fall asleep, same thing today. It is so exhausting to try and stay calm, try and concentrate when really you can't cause your mind is just out of controll. I ought to tell my new main teacher that I could suffer a panicattack in class, actually I should tell this to all my new teachers but I can't muster the courage to do so. This morning it happened again. I don't know why but sometimes when I wake up I cannot move my legs so I just stay in bed regretting everything and having anxietyattacks before I can even get up. Today I would also have sports class or PE whatever you want to call it. Notice from the teacher implies that we would go swimming. I haven't been to PE for a year and I cannot start going again. Really swimming (starts to tremble just from tought). So yes school is hell as ever but I'm in the last year so I hope I can manage by sneaking into the library and SSRI, which is giving me killer headache atm. Thanks for reading."
fhooicq," A runners group sounds nice. I'll check em out, and see if I can find one near me. Thanks for the help. "
n1izxm," My somewhat-of-a-success story. (I'm so sorry, this ended up being way longer than I intended). So I struggled with social anxiety for a while, maybe 12+ years (I'm almost 22). My anxiety was heavily connected to my physical appearance, and as a result I still have almost no self-esteem and a negative body image. From a young age, I was hesitant to try new things, fearing that I would screw up and then get ridiculed for looking like a fool. I was insecure about my looks and obsessed over my appearance and what I wore and how I acted in front of others, constantly worried about scrutiny from my peers and people my age. When I was in elementary school and I had to do presentations in front of the class I would make it about halfway through before the anxiety and stress became too much and I would burst into tears in front of everyone and run out of the class crying. Every single time. It was awful. For a brief period of time I remember being so concerned about people mistaking my age and thinking I was younger than I actually was (I did and still have a baby face) that when I was out walking the dogs with my mom or something I would find a way to bring up my age when we passed people on the sidewalk. I would say to my mom something along the lines of ""in my 7th grade class today we did this"" just so some random stranger whom I had never met would know I was 12 years old and not 9. My social anxiety was probably the worst when I was in high school and my first few years of university. I was so fearful about being negatively evaluated by my peers that I made sure to never do anything to cause them to judge me. I didn't ask questions in class, never got up to leave in the middle to use the bathroom or anything, and I made sure to have the most monotone, resting b-tch face I could, rationalizing that nobody could critique me for my reactions if I never had any. That led me to being called an 'emotionless robot' by my sister once. For a while, every lunch hour I would go home (I lived 5 mins from my high school) to eat because I didn't want to be judged for eating alone. I was embarrassed by my friends and the people I hung out with, thinking others would judge me by association. The only party I went to in high school was on the night we all graduated. Then when I went to university I became even more isolated. I had few friends and could not bring myself to talk to the people sitting next to me. I even faked being sick to get out of class presentations on more than one occasion. When I was feeling especially bad about my appearance, I would skip class because I irrationally thought if I went everyone would think I was ugly and make fun of me. When I look back on these times, I have almost no good memories because everything was overshadowed by my insecurities and fears at the time. To sum it all up, I was miserable for *years*. I felt worthless and alone. I'm just thankful I never went down a path of alcohol or drug use to cope. You're probably thinking, get to the damn point already! I think my social anxiety only got better in the last year or so. I'm well aware that this could be due to the fact that university went online, but I think this fact only played a small role in my improvement. My feelings of inadequacies only subsided after a long and intense period of introspection and contemplation. I kept asking myself why I thought everyone was judging me, and why did I *care* so much if they did? I judged others just as much as myself, so I wondered if I was so hard on myself because I was so judgmental of others, or vice versa. During this exploration of my thoughts and emotions, I eventually accepted that I can't control others' opinions of me and that I'm not going to be liked by everyone, no matter how much I would like to be. I realized that my insecurities about myself are not anyone else's fault, and that much of my fears about being judged were just me projecting my insecurities and issues onto others to shift the blame elsewhere. I used to claim that I ""hated people"" because it was easier to say that than to accept the truth: that I hated myself. Honestly, I stopped worrying what other people thought of me when I stopped caring about what others did! And realized that if someone really cared and was bothered by what I was wearing or doing, well that was their problem, not mine, and says a lot about what kind of person they are. Recently, I've noticed that when doing anything my first thought is no longer ""what if this random person thinks I'm ugly"" or ""what if they don't like me?"". Basically, I've stopped giving a fuck. Which I know makes it sound like I just woke up one day and was like ""I'm cured"", but that's not true. I struggled and felt like shit for what felt like forever. Today, I got rejected by a job. The me from two years ago would have probably been hysterical, taking the rejection personally and telling myself that the company sucked just to make myself feel better. Present me was slightly disappointed, but I recognized that I evidently was not the best candidate and moved on. Obviously everyone's situation is unique and what helped me won't help everyone, but I thought sharing my experience could be of some use to those who are unfortunately still dealing with this shitty disorder. I doubt I'll ever be fully ""cured"" (can anybody?), but I've honestly never felt better. I finally feel like I can be myself :) "
fv1zffc," You say that your social anxiety impacts your ability to lead a normal life. I think that's definitely bad enough to seek help. Any time that a mental issue impairs your daily functioning, that means it's no longer just the usual stuff. Not leaving your house and not eating outside also sound like pretty bad avoidance behaviors. I have severe SAD and I did both things at my worst. Usually getting help in the form of therapy with a licensed counselor or psychiatrist is a good first step. They will give you the help you need and let you know if you need meds or not, but usually therapies like CBT, ACT, and DBT can bring you back on track. Most universities have a free counselling center for students. Try emailing the office if your school has one and ask about the process for making an appointment. You have the right mindset for treatment: you realize there's a problem and you want realistic improvement. That's already a big step! I really wish you luck! "
9tcrlj," I cut the plants in the garden today.... Ye i know it sounds stupid but living in a city i never did that. I didn't know how to use the tools to cut them and i felt incredibly stupid. My uncle told me i am a douchebag and my anxiety was kicking in because the garden is placed in a crowded area (between two buildings) so people could watch me from the windows. Well i thought ""fuck you uncle and fuck these rusty tools"": i managed to do it and the whole process was relaxing actually. It's a small thing but i feel better now because i learned something and my uncle helped me at the end of the day. The End. P.S: i am not ready to yell ""get out of my lawn"" yet though. "
6bw852," How I resolved most of my specific SA.. Hey guys, thought i'd share some of the methods I came up with dealing specific social anxiety. When I was younger I had this terrible feeling that everyone's judging me, looking at what I do, whenever I went to the club or a bar with my friends and someone laughed at the background, I was confident im the one they're laughing at and just felt really bad about it. So I got really tired of this shit, and I decided enough is enough, and basically what I did is whenever I felt someone is judging me I just told to me self (sorry for the language, but its literally what I said to myself) - I don't give a fuck. for example - if a person looked at me at I felt he thinks im a weirdo, well, I dont give a flying fuck, oh this other dude is laughing at me? well, go see if I care, I just didn't care what people think about me anymore, I mean, so what if he doesnt like my shirt? so what if he thinks im weird? so fuckin what? his problem, I couldn't care less, my life, I decide what I want to do with it. as time passed, I started to build confidence, because I simply don't care what others have to say anymore, I started fooling around in public, singing loudly in my helmet while riding my bike because I don't give a *** what the dude in the car next to me thinks, even if that makes him laugh, so friggin what? my life, I enjoy doing that, not gonna see him again in my life anyway. That being said for that part of anxiety being cured, I also had a problem in places such as my work place, I usually came to work, not greeting anyone, maybe a small barely heard good morning and thats it, just kept being embarrased from everyone at work, feeling like they see every move I make. Same here, decided i've had enough and it cant keep being like this. So what I did here was basically to pretend! I pretended to be something I'm not, confident, if I spoke to one of my co-workers I made sure that on the outside I look confident, head up, shoulders up, eye contact till hes the first one to look away, even though I feel like im almost dying on the inside, on the outside I looked confident. When I reached home, I would just greet everyone with a very assertive good morning, even if it felt really really awkward, again, what on the outside mattered to me. As time went by, I noticed that what I was pretending to be, was no longer pretending, my body and mind got used to the new body language, the new line of thoughts, the new confidence and the new ME! it reached a point where I no longer feel awkward, no longer feel anyone is judging me, I always felt jealousy of these guys who just came to work, and everyone just had fun talking to them and just had to do nothing for people to interact with them, well, I became that guy, when I get to work everyone is now greeting me with a big hello and good morning greeting, people just reach up to me for a nice little chat, so I guess I passed this stage of my anxiety life. another thing i've had is a problem with eye contact, I was too focused on where to look that after a few minutes I realized I have have no idea what the person infront of me said, I was terrified of making eye contact. One day I got pissed at it and decided i've had enough of this bullshit. started to learn a little about body language and what everything means and came to a few conclusions and I've decided im gonna try something. what I basically did was force myself to make eye contact untill the person infront of me is the is the first one to look away, and only then I'll look away as well. NO matter how much freakin awkward it gets, and how embarrased I feel, I will maintain eye contact even if its going to kill me. ain't gonna lie, at first it was very hard, felt so damn awkward, felt like the person infront of me thinks im a weirdo for staring at him, felt so awkward, but as time passed, it started to feel very less awkward, and much more natural. today, over a year since I did it, I don't even think about eye contact, it just happens pretty much automatically. btw the reason I made this method is by reading that how humans body language work, and I've found out that the first side to look down is feeling inferior, so I've decided I'll just stare untill the other side looks away and by doing that showing some kind of dominance, and it worked! and my confidence has raised a lot because im guessing in some way my body is convinced its superior by never looking away first and just because I never have this fear anymore. The only social anxiety left for me to cure is being alone around ""hot"" girls, where I go into fight or flight state and it ruins everything for me, but im looking forward to get it over with as well and will be sure to update when I do. Another thing I realized by looking at others, If you do something stupid with enough confidence, it won't look stupid! Good luck guys, be strong, be brave, and don't give a fuck what anyone else thinks about you, its your life, and only you can decide what the hell you want to do with it, burst into a dance in the street with your headphones on, because you want to! let others think whatever they want because you don't give a **** what he thinks.

i26wvk,"Stop looking at me, class of 2020 (casual rant thing).. I really wish people would stop looking at me strangely. I notice the people who do this are other students from my high school, and it really gets to me. I’m just sitting on a bench with my mother waiting on a t-mobile rep to help us, and I keep getting side glances from a girl I knew from high school who (she was alright from what I can remember) who was with her mother. Then I go to a best buy, same thing happens there. Store associates who I knew and didn’t like keep looking at me far away, never wave or say anything. This happens at nearly everywhere location I go to. Grocery stores, restaurants, zoos, bowling, or even just walking down the street. I start getting hot, head starts getting sweaty, and I start getting red all over. Tl;dr I get really anxious when former classmates look at me."
fyjmfxa," We were in a similar line of work, I’m 22f and was a dog walker but got furloughed and currently receiving unemployment benefits. I was hoping to start my own little pet sitting business but that’s on the back burner for now. I have been doing freelance transcription online for some extra padding so it’s def not main income but it is good to help cover bills and food while Im waiting this pandemic out... I’ve also been trying to apply for some entry-level fashion logistics jobs (I feel like there’s less human interaction and more physical doing) but they rejected me per usual bcuz of my lack of experience since dog walking is my only on the books job I’ve had so far 😓. I know I want to work with dogs/pet care business as the main goal somewhere down the line bcuz it’s truly my only real passion and I know for damn sure I am not going to sit in an office all day with gossipy co-workers as my social anxiety/introversion just won’t stand for it lol. I swear I’d rather pick up dog shit for a living than ‘collaborate with others’ that’s how bad I am with people and teamwork I know this is a suggestion you maybe weren’t hoping for or takes a lot of drive n patience but I realize people like us who struggle with SA and are introverts should invest in ways to work for ourselves that way we don’t have to report to a superior or worry about a toxic, people-oriented work environment. Otherwise you can look into data entry type work (entry level/temp) if you know or can teach yourself Excel which is also what I’m trying to do short term to fill the gaps in my resume while I figure out wtf I wanna do with my life.

oqbkc5,"I feel like nobody understands me. I'm a 13 year old who has undiagnosed social anxiety (because my parents think that I'm just crazy and that it's all in my head). Due to social anxiety, I can't even go alone outdoors or talk to the cashier in the supermarket without feeling uncomfortable. Basically I have to do everything with my friends or with someone very close to me, so I won't feel awkward. Sometimes tho I feel this way even with my friends, especially when I'm in a place with a lot of people. When this happens, tho, my friends get annoyed and say that they're just a few people and that they don't probably don't care about me (and that I probably don't have social anxiety and that I'm just exaggerating things). After this usually I head straight home and think about what they say for the rest of the day, thinking about how nobody understands how I feel. Is there any way to make them understand how I feel ?"
cxnh0tn," I take it moment for moment. When I'm at my worst and feel like I have depression with no energy or desire to do anything, I remind myself ""it's just the chemicals in my brain that aren't adjusted properly"" and also remind myself I can do health-related things to help it. For example, drink some water, go outside just to get some air. Otherwise I just get in a state of numbness where I feel like I'm half-conscious about what time it is and such and time just flies by. I just make sure to take a chance to be active whenever I feel I have moments of high energy. I realize this is about SA, but my SA has been longstanding and turned into depression as well. "
9jpof6," I feel like I have social anxiety and that I won't get anywhere in my life. What can I do to change this?. I'm currently 17 years old,male, turning 18 in the beginning of October and feel like I haven't really done anything in my life and I doubt that this will change if I continue living my life the way I do since pretty much ever. So to tell you something about my situation, obviously I'm not the type of person that goes out really often, besides school, going to my piano lessons once a week and playing table tennis twice a week which I probably wouldn't do either if a friend of mine who goes to the same table tennis club didn't go there aynymore. Recently I also overcame my anxiety and went out running from time to time although I live in a relatively small town and I usually go out running in the evening in the woods so I don't encounter a lot of people. Besides the things mentioned above, after school I just sit at home, watch YouTube almost all day long. I used to kill my time with Counter Strike and other games like LoL before that I now quit since last month because I want to focus more on studying, but now I just watch YouTube for longer instead and don't do anything productive at all, studying about an hour a day at BEST although I'm in my last year of the german equivalent of High School and should get my ass up. I seriously should be studying more, especially because the second last year of school, that also counts into the final grade that I will receive after finishing school wasn't very good, also because I rarely talk in class again because I'm too scared to do so. I only really have 3 friends that I rarely meet, aka maybe once a month and beside my family that are the only people I can enjoy being with in public, without feeling too stressed out. When I'm with people I don't know or know but don't really interact with often I feel weird, I don't look people in the eyes for long periods of time, I only smile when I'm like really happy (rarely) or somebody tells a really, really good joke which results into me being the only person that seems to be upset all the time and rarely people will talk to me because of it. Also I try to seat in the very back in class most of the time if I can, because when I'm not I feel like people are starring at me and when people laugh I think they are laughing about me. When people criticise me even about small, unmeaningful things, I feel bad and think about it for long periods of time before I forget it. That doesn't happen that much tho, since I'm home alone most of the time anyways and don't talk often when I'm with people. And the worst thing is the vicious circle I'm in right now: I'm done staying at home almost all the time, I wanna do stuff but at the same time I don't because I'm too shy so interact with people. And now the part of my life starts where I HAVE to go out. One more year and I'm done with school, planning to study law and the nearest university that is 150km away. I won't be with the few friends and family anymore that I have here in my hometown, the only people I'm not afraid to interact with. I will have to seek a place to live in probably together with other students which I'm also frightended of. And I'm afraid that I won't get to know new people, simply because I'm too afraid to be and especially talk with people I don't know. Also I feel weird for not wanting to celebrate my 18th birthday, especially after seeing how other people celebrate inviting 30+ people and I could barely invite 1/10 of that amount. Because of my shyness I also never had a girlfriend in my life, which makes me kinda depressed, especially because I know that this won't change if I continue living this way. I don't know what the fck to do rn ... "
grhhhf,"Last date ended with kiss.. Terrified it will keep going and I won’t like it. I’m a 23F and my last date (2nd) with this guy ended with a quick kiss goodbye. I’m supposed to be seeing him tonight (I wanted to back out but turns out he decided to prepare a cute outdoor lunch so I can’t do this to him at this point). I’m so SO afraid that tonight will be awkward. That since we kissed he’ll kiss me again but for the whole evening. For such a quick kiss, I didn’t have time to know if I liked it!! So if finally I don’t, I have to go through like 3 hours of it tonight and it terrifies me. I know people are going to say just tell him you don’t want to and leave but I don’t know how to face that type of awkwardness Usually first kisses for me have been make out sessions so If I wasn’t comfortable with the guy I could just leave since it was goodbye time anyway and I didn’t have to go through a whole date of it!!

sr4j0c," I'm always embarrassed every time I go outside. Every time I dare to go out, I always embarrass myself or get embarrassed by someone else. I stepped outside for the first time in over a week on Friday, and someone in a car purposely shouted at and jump scared me from behind. He could have done that to literally anyone else, but of course he chose me. I looked and felt like an idiot walking up the rest of the sidewalk. I went to a family party the next day with all of my sibling's friends there, and I literally almost fell on one of their friends for no reason. I tried socialising with people too and every conversation had some spark of my idiocy come out while speaking. Its the next day and I already feel completely drained and need to recharge for another whole week, or even longer. I rarely go out enough as is, so when these things manage to happen every time I do (go outside), it just demotivates me from doing so again. It reinforces why I'm like this in the first place. I'm tired. "
eyu9o0x,"I was listening to some new music while biking once, passed a group of girls (which already makes me uncomfortable), then heard laughs.

Still couldn't get the feeling of them laughing at me out of my head."
6hmoh1, Feeling depressed and weird. Soo... I am a boy who is 17 years old. I am just gonna get to the point. I am feeling depressed for over 2 months now. The main reason is because I overthink and that I think that no one likes me. I have a close friendgroup but most of them are just like me gamers and don't go to party's that often. I really like to party and a copple of my friends join me in that but 1 of them knows so many people from the whole region that he just doesn't look back at me when we are at party's. It's hard to describe the whole situation but I'm going to try. I have 2 veryyy close friends in the group where I meet up with. One of them is like I said very popular with all the other 'cool skaterboys popular kids' and the other one is very fun but also when we're at a party they just go to other friends and don't look at me. It just feels like I'm their friend just because they have no one else. I also have struggle to talk to people. I'm a very joyfull and happy person and most people like me when they know me well but I am scared of making new friends. I trust no one from my age because I got bullied when i was 10 years old. Now I overthink everyday that people will bully me again or will attack me for no reason. All the people of my age that I see or know through my other friends are just also kinda like those skaterboytypes. I am not like that at all. Sometimes they just say like fuck it we are going to the big city in our region and I don't like doing things like that. Everything for me has to be planned in advance. They are so different than me and I'm trying to make other friends but I am so scared of everybody and I can't keep a conversation going for more than 10 min. I asked one of my friends to introduce me to his friends from another city and we were going to do that next week. Now he cancelled it because 'He doesn't want to mix his 2 friendgroups' basicly saying that I won't blend in. I feel like i don't blend in with any group I like being with popular and fun kids but then I'm quiet but when I am with my friends Who are maybe losers but I feel comfterble their because i am more popular than they. It's very hard to explain but can anyone give me tips or help me because i'm so depressed right now or give your opinion. 
6wqota," I talked with a complete stranger sitting on a bench for 10 minutes!. So there I was today in town waiting for my mom and I sat down on an empty bench. A minute after I sat down some woman came there and sat down next to me, said that she was also waiting for someone. I reciprocated and after a few smalltalk sentences back and forth I started talking with her about my school, plans for university and she mentioned what her daughter has planned and some other stuff. Nice chat. I felt really good about it later. To think that a couple of years back I was an anxious fuck with zero self esteem who could barely talk to people or even look them in the eye... damn I made it far. And so can you! Every single one of you can do it. You just need to put in the work. If any of you wanna talk to me about anything and I mean it - anything, feel free to message me. We're in this together people! "
pig81c,"Progress is not only possible, it will happen. Listen guys, one year from now on you could be a different person and I mean it. I have changed a lot and I am only about 8 Months in on taking actions and truly giving it my all to get better. You need the right environment to develop and that is most likely not going to be your school or your workplace. Where my change happens is outside in public or meeting with friends. My progress is not to the point where I am outgoing and likeable. In fact, my anxiety will still be noticeable in most social situations. I am talking about quality of life here. Just going out in public, the cars and people don't bother me. Doing phonecalls and talking to family or one friend at a time has got way easier, although I still kind of make a fool out of myself now and then. But what it is about that I am able to connect with people. Who cares about a little akward moment at the start. I am not good at building connections, but if you don't give up at the first akward moment it will happen and it will be worth it. The solutions to social anxiety are counterintuive. I don't want to get to deep into my beliefs and strategies, because I know here are negative people, ready to bash me. I also find that not every tip is right for every stage of social anxiety. For me personally, I have learned that all the things the classic person with social anxiety cares about, are exactly the things that build social anxiety. For example I used to stress much about having a strong voice while talking. But what happened? Ok I greeted loud, now I am exhauseted and feel like I have made it and want to go home. Suddenly something unexpected happens, a person wants something from me. Now my voice is weak. But what if you get yourself to a point where you are just a bit annoyed if you come across as anxious? Suddenly you start to question your rational why you want to beat social anxiety. You want to express yourself, you want to build connections with other people, you want to feel less lonely and less pain."
orpndm,I wanna go for a run but scared of being looked at by passing cars. Fucking sucks
dr2aoqu,"""white knight to save them from the deluge of assholes""nnIndeed. This is a romantic trope that's continually used in fiction. It warps people's perceptions of reality and what constitutes normal human behaviour for that matter. I think being a 'nice guy' is over rated. I think being a 'good guy' is what we should aim for. The dating/relationship 'market' is saturated with a deluge of assholes so that's why you are probably a breathe of fresh air. The way I see it? Find a girl who is worth suffering for. Who you can withstand life's tribulations with.nThis is all coming from a 24 year old relatively good looking virgin so hey.. maybe my advice is bullshit haha. Either way, I'm not going to lower my standards or change my approach until such time as I see that I should. I'm firmly in the camp of marching to the beat of my own drum because otherwise life is purposeless. nTake heart my friend. Not all girls are like that. There are the occasional diamonds in the rough."
d4ia791,"&gt; Doesn't matter if I haven't camped in 10 years and have no idea how 'camp.' You don't need to know anything, believe me. Is there's someone more experienced there? Just tell them you have no experience whatsoever but you are open to learn. Don't be afraid to ask for assistance and see it as a learning experience. &gt; if I make a fool out of myself and they end up hating me I assure you, except if you hurt someone physically voluntarily, they won't hate you. At worst they will believe that you aren't good at camping (who is good at anything at his first time? no one). I did the same last year, it was a great experience. We were doing 6h Via Ferrata far from home so we camped there 2 nights. I learned a lot there, both about camping and myself."
in6fpq,"Is there any medication that still could save my life?. Hey dear friends, I suffer from social anxiety and depression since I was 15 years old. Right now I'm on 750mg moclobemide (Aurorix) and had my first talk with a behavioral therapist. Before I already had two depth-psychological therapies without great success. The moclobemide doesn't show any effects neither. I also tired many various medications like different S(N)SRIs, Escitalopram (Cipralex), Venlafaxine, Sertraline (Zoloft, Opipramol, Paroxetine, Duloxetine (Cymbalta), Bupropion (Wellbutrin), neuroleptics as Quetiapine (Seroquel), Promethazine and Benzos as Diazepam (Valium) and Lorazepam (Tavor). Benzos always only as emergency med. None of this meds helped me, just gave me side effects, except for the benzos, but yeah they only were for emergency. I can't go on like that, I can't feel many emotions, I can't have fun, I can't go outside or meet friends or girls. I can't sleep well, I can't eat, my cognition doesn't function and my self esteem is very low. Might there be any other meds that still could give me hope? My behavioral therapy would start someday but until then it's at least 3 months. I also abused phenibut because it was the only thing that helped me and it doesn't work anymore. Now I have the problem of an addiction and tapering off but I'm in medical treatment for that with baclofen. It's all just too much and I can't see any positive future being like this restricted, low, bad-tempered and psychologically, physically and cognitively dysfunctional. I would love to hear about your experiences, suggestions and tips! Hugs to all of you! &lt;3"
dpe9m0y,"I feel your pain. This has become one of the biggest issues for me. I avoid everywhere. I cannot even go for a walk from my house anymore for fear of seeing someone I know.nI hate it so much. Sometimes I try to think back to a time when this wasn't controlling my decisions, it must have been the early years of high school. "
95ovy6," Got unexpected guests today. I'm currently sitting outside in our backyard. My mother is inside talking to our guests who showed up a while ago. I had been on a walk with one of our dogs, and when I were on my way home I saw my mother talking with a couple of people at our frontdoor. So I took another way and walked to the Backyard and have been here since. My mother came down to check on my and said that it was ok that I stayed outside. I know that the best thing would be to go inside and try to be social, but it would just be weird to come inside now. I hate social anxiety and social phobia so much. "
4m3cti," My niece just moved in our house, and it's turning terribly.. Now first, I want say that I don't know if this is the right subreddit to talk about this, but you can direct me to a more appropriate one if this is the case. On May 18 of this year, my niece (almost 13) began living with me and my mom again, since her father (my older brother) moved back to Ohio, but something happened that made her go to foster care. He's the reason why we had to adopt her as our own. And her mother just had a new baby last year, but she had history with illegal drugs. Anyway, on the 18th, she started living here. And since then, I began making plans and changing my routines. My mom currently has little to no money, so I decided to pay for my own stuff with my own money from now on, or at least try to. We already have another child in here,so as a (now-legal) teenager I vowed to do the best that I can to accomplish my own priorities and fix my own issues. Everything was fine for a while; she goes swimming at our local rec center, she goes to the playground every once in a while, and she wasn't putting any stress on me and mom. Until something happened last Saturday (May 28) where she went somewhere without asking Mom permission if she can go. Mom got incredibly upset after this and [niece] had an attitude and was talking back at her when they were talking about this in the living room, which I found unacceptable, especially at an age as 12. I was in my room when I heard yelling and talking back through my door. And she had her grandfather with her to get involved in the matter, so I definitely didn't want to come out. I was annoyed, but at the same time, I knew something like this was going to happen. And from then on, it just continued and continued. Mom was just yelling at her today, telling her that she is not like her father and should never become him. So now my mom is kind of depressed. She has to go back to work tomorrow, needs to go to Ohio to fill out papers, has to deal with [niece] when she has an attitude problem, she has little to no money, gets too much anxiety, and is mad at her father for being a disappointing son and the reason all of this happened (as well as traits [niece] inherited from him). But at the same time, she doesn't want her to feel like she's a burden in the household. I'm worried for her. I'm worried that my family will fall apart because of her living here. But like I said, I'm trying not to become a problem for her, which she says I'm doing a great job at (for a good year, that is). Now as for my relationship with [niece], I tend to stay my room for most of the day, doing my own things, setting goals, studying for my Finals, finding a job, etc. I do occasionally say ""hi"" to her when we're passing by, 'cause I also don't want to make her feel like she's a burden. She's more extroverted as I am introverted. (TL;DR): I'm worried that our family is going to be torn apart because my niece living with us. And I don't want to make her feel like she's a burden, but she has some issues that are troubling to me and mom. I don't know if I should do something, but if anybody is willing to help, that would be much appreciated. -Thank You. "

sxjb1c," Anyone down for some voice/text chatting while playing games?. Hello! Me(22M) and my friend(22F) are looking for a person or two who would be interested in playing video games(CO-OP) while voice/text chatting. My friend also has somewhat severe social anxiety but she recently managed to get into voice chatting which I was proud to help with. English is my 2nd language--which is another burden I carry--so there will be a slight language barrier. I should be able to understand most things but please take it slow. The CO-OP games I have are listed below: **~~(x)~~** = my friend doesn't have * *Dying Light 1* * *Left4Dead 2* (I have poor memory so I don't even remember the campaign) * *Raft* **~~(x)~~** * *Deep Rock Galactic* **~~(x)~~** * *Factorio* * *7 Days to Die* * *TheHunter: Call of the Wild* (We enjoy this one because it's relaxing and you're kind of hiking) * *Terraria* * *Satisfactory* **~~(x)~~** * *Monster Hunter World* * *Borderlands 2* * *Euro Truck Simulator 2* * *Divinity Original Sin 2* (Although I kind of want to finish my single playthrough first) * *Stardew Valley* * *The Forest* * *Squad* **~~(x)~~** ~~(perchance?)~~ * *Barotrauma* **~~(x)~~** * *FFXIV* (Aether) etc. I don't remember anything else. I have like 500+ games on Steam, so, if you have CO-OP games that you want to play that I don't have, I'm probably going to end up buying it. I'm very new to most of these games because I don't really have anyone to play it with (excluding friend, although we have different work schedules from time to time) I would appreciate it if we are on the same/nearby time zone (North America - Eastern/Central time). And similar age group (20-25) No Discord server invites, please. If you are a person who's seeking a gaming buddy but you're on a different time zone, perhaps you can meet people via comment section below (if there are any). So everybody benefits. Reach me via Reddit chat/comment section. Depending on the traffic of inquiries, I would like to apologize in advance if I'm not able to reach out to you. Cheers! "
fi8syaz," It’s not a cure. This is a life long mental illness. There will be relapses, feelings of helplessness, depression, etc. The hardest part of learning to cope with social anxiety is taking the first step to change. Same with any other mental illness that can be managed. Telling a person with social anxiety to just go outside and talk is ignorant to their own feelings because that’s something they’re TRYING to do, but, in a lot of cases, it feels as if it’s near to impossible. A close friend of mine has panic attacks every time she goes to the store alone. She avoids going to avoid feeling like shit. Going to do something that feels like shit will make you avoid it. Keep in mine, alot of them lose social skills because of this so they will have to learn how to gain these so they can contribute to society. Social anxiety can sometimes even been confused for mild autism (yes, it has happened to me), which prolongs the treatment process. It may be easier for you than others, especially if there are external reinforcers that contribute to their mindset. I just think saying something like this is just extremely unhelpful and doesn’t take into account the person’s specific situation. "

fhj0l0y," Wow, this is actually really inspirational for me. I’m super happy for you after all this effort you can live your life. If you don’t mind I’ll explain what exactly my problems are and how they are started. It may be long. I don’t know if you take the time for it, but if you do I would appreciate it a lot, because the things you wrote are super inspirational. My english ain’t the greatest, but I would do my best to make things as clear as I can. I’ve had a rough childhood. I had no safe home due of mental and physical abuse for around 8 years since I was 5. When I finally had a safe home my confidence was down to zero. I’ve literally escaped to another city with my family. I felt like I had no change to develop myself normally. I was exposed to things children doesn’t need to exposed to at that age. Anyway, I knew it wasn’t normal, but I tried to move on. When I was around 15 I experimented with drugs and alcohol. Such a stupid choice when your already feeling bad and insecure about yourself. In a lot of social situations I turned in myself. People called me quite all the time and I felt different then everyone else. That was painful because it followed me in every social situation. I just didn’t know what to say, because I think I wasn’t recovered from what I’ve already gone through. My family didn’t accept me because I was so introvert. High school was a disaster. I got bullied by my own ‘friends’ (yeah, that’s possible). Some how against all expectations I managed finish high school. I went to college and slowly I felt my bucket of water was running over. One day I smoked weed before class and I had my first anxiety attack. It was horrible and terrifying. I was too afraid to take the bus so I walked to my home for around 4 hours. I ignored it completely. I had experience kinda anxiety attacks with weed before. When it was summer I decided to try magic mushrooms with my friends. They took it, so I thought I would be fine. Everything went in such a quick rush. It was a impulsive decision. I still regret it. I experienced my 2nd major anxiety attack. It was horrible. Especially the first hour of the trip I couldn’t accept it and I felt the most uncomfortable you could imagine. Months later I experienced anxiety more and more. Also when I was sober. I started to get hyperventilation and at that point, my life completely went down the hill. I started to get intense fears of being in places I couldn’t leave. Especially social situations. For months I tried to get back to school. I was cycling to school day after day and I was too afraid to get inside. Anxiety for a panic attack was the thing that was destroying my life. I started to get help. I thought I was on the right place, but after a year I actually noticed I wasn’t. They weren’t specialized in anxiety problems. It did help me a bit. I even went to Spain and I actually break through a lot of fears those 2 weeks, but also I walked against my anxiety at some point. Overall it was a hopeful little period of time. I was completely breaking my social anxiety fears. I was talking to strangers and I felt good and I enjoyed it. Anyway, when it was over, my anxiety slowly returned. (I think) because of my bad experiences with drugs I developed fear for alcohol, coffee and medicine as well. My therapist noticed it as well and at one day she said it wasn’t go to work out, so they decided to let me go. After that, I became in a gap. My fears increased. I developed more fears I already had. I started to avoid more and more. Taking the train and bus wasn’t possible anymore. Doing groceries wasn’t possible anymore. Especially doing it alone was becoming impossible. I managed to go with someone, but after a while that wasn’t possible either. I couldn’t get my hair cut anymore. I couldn’t hang out with my friends anymore. I couldn’t see my family anymore. All of this slowly developed in 1 year till now. At the moment I can’t even open my door anymore. I still live at my moms house and I actually have no responsibilities at all. My fears are literally in everything now. I can’t watch a movie, because I will fear I lose control and do something evil. I’m extremely alert and anxious for ‘evil’ things and it’s ridiculous. Even my hobby; making music, is affected because of it. I can’t open my front door anymore, because my social anxiety feel completely overwhelming. If my mom or my sister is away and I’m alone I feel kinda paranoid. Which is something I am fearful for that I have. I feel in constant battle with my thoughts. I am constantly afraid of losing control. That I’ll snap and do something incredibly stupid. I’m even fearful of myself. I feel like I have to be constantly alert and it actually goes automatically. I’m fearful of psychoses. Anything that is a little ‘trippy’ freaks me out. Till not long ago I was taking walks everyday, but since that is gone I feel incredibly bad. I feel like I kinda lost myself. I don’t who I am under this anxiety. That’s freaks me out, because I don’t know if it’s any good. I’m depressed out the future. I totally not feel connected with the world. Physically as well(hard to explain). I just feel completely out of place. Everything is just negative. Constantly. Because it’s 24/7 I wonder if this is just GAD, social anxiety and depression. It makes me insecure. I’m afraid to expose myself outside of my home. I believe I was born more shy and thoughtful then a regular person, but if I haven’t go through all of this I don’t think I would have suffer this much. I was afraid to sleep alone till an age of 15 for example and I still don’t feel comfortable being alone. I’m 20 years old btw, so I probably have quite some time ahead of me.. And yeah, depressed about the future. I don’t see me having a girlfriend, traveling, partying, working, going to school or just having fun in general at all anymore. "
cqxzbb,"Success! I have been able to stay at parties and other social events!. In the summer there are many religious parties in Portugal because it is a very catholic country. In thesr parties filarmonics are hired to play music and I belong to one so as it us expected during these times, is that I have to play in many villages. Well, every year we play in a certain village far way from our home town, in Guarda. We get there by late afternoon and we eat a snack, play on a procession, eat dinner and then go to the party. The party is basically a stage with a musical group singing and dancing with a wide open space in between for people to dance and nearby you have a bar and such... Last year I had a panic attack during one of these, it was awful. So many people around me made me not wanting to dance with the band members that were all doing it and then I stood out and bam, got overly nervous. This year was different, I brought valium from home just in case but I didnt need to use it. Me and my friends were having a great time, drank a few beers, danced and even talked to some gals, we are around 16 and 17 years of age btw. I was astonished, I made it, I didnt even get nervous. It was surreal. Im really happy I have succeed in this, still have a long way to get better at othet stuff :)"

594wdh," Getting a job?. Hey all, I'm a 20 year old woman with social anxiety who's trying to find her first job. Problem is my anxiety is sky high about it and I'm terrified of actually getting a job. I was wondering if anyone had any useful advice for managing their anxiety when starting work for the first time. I really do want to push myself and start actually having adult responsibilities because I know it's an important step and will make me feel better in the long run but I'm just finding it hard to stop my mind from jumping to bad scenarios like ""what if I embarrass myself, what if I can't do the job"" etc etc. Has anyone else been through this and how do you cope with it? Thank you! "
8v2xrk," Help with social and appearance issue. I am 20 year old virgin male who has never been in a relationship, I'm not really sure if I am ugly but my brothers lightly drunk friend have said so and is the reason I have no success with women. This coupled with social anxiety has lead to me being isolated from my peers at uni and resulting in no social life. For curiosity's same after my brothers friend called my ugly at a holiday to a city , I made a tinder account to see if he was correct, and unfortunately he was correct and I deleted the app. Overall I'm not fat by any means, I regularly go mountain biking and this has kept me in a really good physical condition. moreover, I have a good well paying job lined up as a civil engineer when I complete my last few semesters at uni. However, I am immensely afraid of leaving leaving university, as it is my only means of potential social interaction with girls. I know when I start working as a civil engineer I will be unable to socialize outside of work as I am terribly afraid of going out (bad experience at nightclub when previously mentioned brothers friend and some others essentially made me go to a nightclub, I just sat down on a stool for 3 hours feeling pathetic and useless than I ever have). I also don't drink alcohol at all never go out with friends (never been drink) and essentially have no friends other than people i check my engineering subjects work withTaking this into account I am fairly certain after uni I would have lost all chances of meeting a girl. Overall I am very concerned that I will simply die alone as a virgin, resulting in me feeling depressed and having almost daily suicidal thoughts (when I'm sitting in lectures alone as always I just think about ending my life and how to do it becauae life is too difficult and most likely will get much worse). I am not sure what to do, I have tried socializing but I stutter, I even help people with math and physics just so I can talk to them but nothing changes, everyone avoids me and I feel immensely isolated from the world , like I don't fit in (became very apparent at uni and nightclub) and should just die.

ox1zii," how do i stop chasing others approval? how do i stop being needy or desperate for attention? how do i make friends w/o chasing them?. Its always me chasing others. no one chases me or likes me. i try so hard to make friends but it doesnt work. maybe im just a boring ""pretending to be nice guy"" i dont know how to love my self or how to make friends or how to stop chasing others or how to be smart. what does ""stop chasing mean"" ? i always compare my self to others especially successful ppl on YouTube bc youtube is my only social media and i feel small compared to them, like i feel everyone is better than me at everything. and have better personality i feel pressured to learn every skill/know everything that is available on internet/impress everyone/make friends with everyone and i live in a town in iraq/kurdistan where the only available hobby is soccer. no music class no art class. no martial art study no library no swimming pool and no parks to juggle in. but i want move out soon no dating allowed in my town and being 19 and looking at guys at my age with gfs.. hard not to compare my self. harder to avoid porn but i want to learn useful skills i want to be smart and have some meaning but i dont know what the fuck am doing in life. i know that chasing others/porn/texting girls are all a waste of time. im tired of those and i base my self worth on how others reply to me. idk to be silent all the time is better or talk all the time better? i told my self if i speak i might learn from mistakes. I feel like im so afraid of wasting my life away. I feel like at this point i should just go do something and fuck all these things i just said. But when i try to think of something to do there is nothing. And then i think ""einstein did that"" or that person did that and i havent done anything. Im just some guy trying to learn mechanic skills with my dad. "
dplbnd7,"I'm 21 now, but as a teen I would avoid all group activities and presentations. I coped by skipping presentation days and other classes. Thinking about it, I skipped by myself a lot of the time. Listening to music and going for a walk, finding somewhere to sit in the grass, or hiding in the bathroom/changeroom stalls"
dy50cbh," So at my school, we had a small cafeteria so many people ate outside in a courtyard. In 10th grade, I had no friends, so I would sit on this small pile of bricks in a corner of the courtyard by myself to eat. I did this for over half the year, until eventually students actually started coming up to me to keep me company because they felt sorry for me. Whenever they asked why I sit by myself, I would lie and say that my friends weren’t in this lunch group or something. I was embarrassed to be around them, but I appreciated their kindness "
57q1tc," some random guy insulted my appearance. I was at an amusement park minding my own business. I didn't even look at the guy until he said something. I have an androgynous appearance... I have a shorter haircut and I wear masculine clothing. I'm skinny and I have a feminine face. I also have a prominent adams apple and broad shoulders. I have a hormonal imbalance, so I have some masculine features. It is difficult for others to tell if I'm a guy or a girl.. regardless, I do what I want with my appearance. I do whatever makes me comfortable. I never try to bother anyone. As I was walking past, I hear this guy say to me ""hey you have a nice costume there sir.. I mean ma'am"".. I was at this amusement park for a halloween event, but I was literally wearing a hoodie and jeans, so he was making fun of my appearance. I don't look normal.. I have dark freckles all over my face and I am androgynous looking. I admit that my appearance makes me stand out in a crowd, but did I really deserve to be insulted like that? This guy, who was sitting on a bench at an amusement park, literally took the time out of his night to insult my looks. I wanted to stick up for myself, but it took a while for me to process what he was saying.. it took me a while to process the fact that someone would actually be that cruel to a person who is minding their own business. I just don't understand why someone would do something like that, or why someone do something like that in an environment as positive and carefree as an amusement park.. it just blows my mind "
hjo6xx," Made a small step today. I’ve really been trying to keep moving forward to feel comfortable around a others, for weeks I can hide in my room away from anyone even family. SA can be so much more crippling then people can know. Today I built up the courage to actually call all my friends (this is something I never do I hate calls with a passion) and made plans to meet in the park snd catch up as I hadn’t seen some of them for almost a year, when we were together I just let myself be me without being so anxious and not be counting down to when I can be alone. For years I’ve struggled and even tho it’s a tiny little minor thing that normal people don’t even think of to me it feels like a huge achievement to me. Tl;dr got out my comfort zone and organised plans myself for me and friends to meet and I wasn’t super anxious. "
dliaqvi, Thanks! I have done a lot of research on the backpacking and it looks like that will be what I do.Thanks for the birthday wishes--I really hope to have one without my own self-imposed neuroses 
fnstgl7," You sort of have a defeatist attitude though. I don’t think all of us have to be shy and have SA forever. Like, you’re right — some of us may have a shy nature that’ll always be engrained into us. But we can still work on our shyness/anxiety to the point it’s almost unnoticeable. We don’t all have to be quiet forever. Sometimes, I don’t mind when people ask me why I’m quiet. Sometimes I wish more people asked me. That way, I can just open up. Whenever I’ve said I’m really shy in response to this, people are usually more understanding. Obviously I don’t get super personal and say I have SAD and give more details, but saying I’m pretty shy ends up being nice. "
fhbpud9," Yeah, idk if I fit the bill for being agoraphobic. My fear of not going outside is especially focused on social situation. My GAD is also severe. I am doubting everything I do as well. Like even watching a normal movie gives me fears. I’m extremely scared of losing control and I some how don’t feel in control already. I’m afraid of being a bad person. I’m afraid of psychoses. I’m super afraid of ‘scary’ things. It’s hard to explain. But basically I just feel very sensitive to everything in life and I’m adding anxiety to every situation. I’m close to having therapy. I’ve had my first appointment a week ago which I some how managed to do with a lot of support. I actually had one today where I wanted to discuss a plan with me but my fears where too high and I have the flu... I’m feeling super depressed about it. "
romntw, Finally found a girl who likes me.. Ok so I was on Ok Cupid and this girl matched with me. She really seemed interested and wants to meet me at a park near me. I’m scared I’ll fuck it up due to my social anxiety. Any tips 
572mj5," I can't fathom someone liking me.. I've recently become friends with a coworker, we've hung out a couple of times and she texts me at least once or twice a week to hang out. I'm still convinced she hates me. I'm waiting for the moment where she turns around and tells me it was all a joke and that I'm a loser. She has explicitly told me she thinks I'm hilarious and a cool person but I just can't believe her. She knows about my social anxiety and I've even asked her if she enjoyed hanging out and if I wasn't too wallflowerish to which she said she would tell me if she doesn't like me. I just can't grasp it though, it doesn't make sense to me. She did all of the work to initiate the friendship. She started talking to me, and inviting me out(took me out for my 21st birthday) and keeps in contact through text but I can't shake this feeling in the back of my head telling me that she hates me and thinks I'm a loser despite **mountains** of evidence to the contrary. "
ezk9in8,"I'm exactly in the same boat. Never went outside except for school since I was 11, I'm 23 now. The worst part is with 23 I'm off family insurance and everyone here is required by law to have some form of health insurance. So now my parents are forced to pay 250€ every month for my insurance because I'm not in school or working. Just the thought of applying for a job completely paralyses me. Especially since I live in a small town where you barely get any jobs to begin with. I have no car or drivers license so traveling for work feels like an impossible task too. Killing myself seems like the only option but even that I could never do."
pk18gw,"I think I have social anxiety but I'm not sure who to tell. I (16M) think I have social anxiety. I've had the symptoms of SA for years but I always thought I was just extremely shy and introverted but when I started high school it started getting really bad so I decided to do some research and I most likely have SA. For starters I just entered my third year of high school and I have no friends, and I haven't spoked to anyone except family in months because even though I know people aren't judging me my brain constantly tells me they are. My entire life has been ruined by what I think is social anxiety, I can't even do simple tasks like taking the dog for a walk without stressing over it, everyday before I take my dog for a walk I stress over my appearance, I worry about who I'm going to see and what they're going to think of me. Whenever I hear people laughing my heart starts pounding because I think they're laughing at me even though they aren't. I lost all my friends and the close connections I had with some of my family isn't there anymore. As I said before this is my third year of high school but my second year doing it online because I'm too afraid to go in person, I literally can't even walk in the halls without feel uncomfortable. I used to love school, playing sports and hanging with Friends but I can't do those things anymore. I don't want to make this to long, but the list of things I experience goes on. Anyways thanks for listening to my ""rant"" hopefully I can't figure myself out."
g3cv52c," For sure bro! She lives close to me, so one day I just texted her casually asking if she’d like to go on a walk. I told myself that with her I’d try something I hadn’t really tried with other girls: I’d be my true self, and try to say what was truly on my mind without holding back for fear of judgement. Eventually these walks became more frequent, and our conversations became more deep/personal. And then I found out she really likes me! So really it came out of a willingness to take a step that I was afraid of. I was scared to send that original text (and subsequent ones), thinking for sure I’d be rejected. But I said “fuck it, what do I really have to lose”? It’s all about that first, scary step. You’ll never know what could have been if you don’t take it. I’m convinced that everyone in this Subreddit is lovable; they just don’t realize it so they don’t take any steps to help that special person connect with them. I should also mention I’ve been rejected by many girls in the past, so I of course understand how crushing and confidence-draining that cycle can be. But I maintained my faith and never gave up belief in myself. Therapy helped a TON with that. But ultimately I would add that being myself was the most important part. Social anxiety tries to make you control/alter yourself, because you are afraid that the real you isn’t lovable. This is bullshit. Being the real you is exactly what will show the right person how beautiful, special and unique you are. Even if you’re uncomfortable, just do it. And with the right person, your “embarrassing peculiarities” will become the adorable quirks which distinguish you from other people. "
nwa951,"Just felt like typing this out lol. With my social anxiety I feel sort of trapped at the moment. And it sucks because the only way forward is to do things I don't want to do. I don't want to walk outside by myself, I want to sit here and watch YouTube and Netflix for 16 hours a day, and that's where the depression comes in. Half the time I'm watching YouTube I'm bored out my mind and I'm searching for the perfect video to no avail. It depressing af, like I said I feel trapped. I don't even know what I want."
apzob6," I really hate what I have become, don't be like me. I figured I'd write on here for people who were once like I was. I have just turned 25 and my life feels all but over, I am unhappy and difficult to be around, even going so far as to slam doors on people and be a general pain in the ass to my mum, dad and sister. I always wanted to be a good person, but I really am not much of anything anymore. I just wish I was normal. I developed terrible social anxiety after being bullied around age 15 and held it in for a long time. I wasn't able to ask for help from those around me cause I was too frightened. Didn't mean harm by it, but I didn't have the courage or insight to talk. I began using drugs to deal with it through university and at 23 I tried to jump off a bridge and have been in and out of institutions ever since. I live at home now being more of a burden every day, I imagine I'll have to go to another hospital sometime soon. Seems like this will be my life and as I said, whatever I used to be, I'm not gonna be that anymore and that is why it breaks my heart. Please, please just say you need help and please don't take drugs like benzodiazepine without guidance, it isn't worth it for the short term benefits. I really hope you guys can find a way to deal with this particular anxiety problem. I know how lonely it can be, and I really hope you make it through these forests intact or better than you were before you went in. Take care ✌️ "
rz7rxe," I don't enjoy going out anymore. Growing up, my parents never let me go out much so whenever there was an opportunity to go out, I took it with both arms open. But now everytime I leave my house, even if I have the time of my life, I always come back and feel this huge wave of sadness and regret about the way I looked, acted and I feel inadequate for no reason. Today my family had a beach outing and I actually declined going. My body felt physically sick at the thought of going out and having to show myself at the beach. I'm really sad that this is what my life has become because I can never enjoy going out in public without all these thoughts coming over me. I wish I was normal "
kow283," I wish i could meet quiet people more often. Being around extroverted people all the time can make you feel like you aren't normal. The few times i stumbled upon quiet/shy people made me feel a lot better for not being alone in this. I'm spending two weeks on a beach house with my relatives, and all of them are talkative and out going. I see my cousins talking and laughing together while i'm on the other side of the room watching memes. I feel left out, and it's my fault for not interacting with them. "
8lo2nj," I could really use some advice. Hello everyone, so a bit of background before i dive into things.... Im 23 yr old male who has two younger sisters, one that is 21 and another that is currently 15. Now this is all relative to the youngest one which im trying to help or do my best to understand what she is going through to maybe improve or give her some guidance on getting through things The youngest sister has social anxiety. She sometimes cant do some tasks which i would consider a breeze and not a worry to me but to her it builds into a panic attack and ends in a hyperventilating breakdown. Her and I are very close and I do my best to try and give her advice from my perspective but im afraid my advice may not work as well due to me being a polar opposite to her. I was looking for some advice to pass on from some of you guys and gals to maybe give to her. She has trouble even wanting to wake up or show up to school due to being so nervous or worrying about what others may think, she cant talk to someone in the hall way and ask for even the time without panicking. I know this load of text probably isnt easy to read as its alot of thoughts at once but i really wanna help her. I dont wanna see my youngest sister have to go through such a hard time all the time So my resolution is that im open to any words or advice i can give her from people who suffer from this, because it just seems like my advice may not be striking in the right areas for her or maybe even some ways to cope with it or ways to improve on it that i can teach her Thank you very much for reading this and I'm happy to hear from anyone about ways i can help her "
g1yiibc," Ah, I totally get that. Do you think you’ll adjust okay when everything’s back to normal? For me, after this socializing failure, I’m planning to force myself to go on a walk everyday and say hi to at least one stranger. So hopefully I won’t become a legit recluse. Here’s hoping anyway. "
elkg39h," I think mine is worse IRL than online but yea I delete posts  and comments a lot too. People online like to be mean because there is no consequences for their actions. Especially on games, I very rarely type in the chat because I know I'll be judged and they will most likely say something about it. I remember writing something like ? + ? = ? and had it wrong because I was too stressed to think. I looked like an idiot. Another thing that I hate is when I write the same word twice. Something like this: I took a walk to the park and and I suddenly saw a unicorn cross the street. Sometimes my sentences aren't complete and in my head they feel like they are and I'll hit enter and panic. I force myself to chat on Reddit to improve, generally mean comments get tons of down votes and that makes me feel better if I fuck up. "
71a371, There is no cure so why even bother?.

di7yq4y,"Hey man, I'm currently 8 months into a body transformation starting with about 40 lbs overweight and a shitty posture from gaming all day every day. I first of all want to mention that the first steps (no pun intended) are the hardest, because it's not easy to completely change your lifestyle. It might be hard to leave the house for anything at first, but once you see the results you will gain a lot of confidence and it's going to 100% be worth the struggle you had to go through.nnI used to jog late in the day, and I had a nice 2 miles track my parents used to run which is in a very nice and quiet area. If you have anything like that around your area, start with that. If not, it's honestly no big deal. Just think about it... whenever you see anyone fat jogging outside you think ""wow that's great, he's working on his health"", people think no different when they see you jogging outside, if they even notice you at all. There is no reason to be anxious, it's just a shitty game that's playing in your head.nnYou can also go to the gym if you have one nearby, you can make some muscle while you burn fat as a starting lifter, which could boost your confidence as well. I've been going to the gym all these months and honestly, there is nothing to be scared about. People are generally really nice there, those big muscular people are just there to do their thing, nobody will judge you!nnnAlso like xNovaz said, you can lose weight while not doing any exercise at all, it's all about how many calories you eat and how many you burn. But this is a really good opportunity to make a change to your life, so I hope you get over your fears.nn"
poedcq,"I want a relationship, but I also don’t want a potential partner to realise what a fool I am.. I often fantasise about being in a relationship (20F), but then cringe at the thought of someone being attracted to me and then realising how socially incompetent and awkward I am. I’ve never been in a relationship or been asked out or anything. I feel like everyone my age is moving in with their partners or dating someone while I’m still trying to figure out how to speak to other humans. How could anyone possibly be interested in someone like me? I’m too anxious about nearly everything to be any fun, and I feel like I’d be more work than is worth it. Being such an introvert, I also wonder whether I’d get sick of a partner and what the heck I would do with them when I enjoy so few activities. Probably a lot are due to social anxiety - for example, I HATE going to the beach. I love the look of it, but it involves swimming or minimal clothes and I haven’t owned a swimsuit or shorts since I was about 13, and many are crowded. Not to mention my appearance. Sometimes I look in the mirror and think I look pretty good, then I catch a glimpse of my face somewhere else and realise I look terrible. I want to know if I’m just self conscious and actually really good looking, or self aware of my ugliness, but my family would never be honest and I haven’t really got friends to ask."
fmnh7hr," Is there something in particular that happens whenever you meet new people? What causes every attempt you make to reach out fail? There is a possibility that you're just not finding the right people to vibe with. That doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you. If there are no in-person communities that match with your interests, try joining online communities that do. Online friends might not be the same as having irl friends, but at least it will help to keep the loneliness at bay. I know its really, really, REALLY hard, but you have to learn to love yourself. You have to. Its a cliche saying, but it is true that if you don't love yourself, it is likely that others won't either. If you don't love yourself, every rejection will hurt twice as much because you'll feel as though that rejection only solidifies how you feel about yourself. How do you do love yourself? It's not going to happen overnight, obviously. Start with the little steps. Keep a journal of the things you do and thoughts you have every day, record both the good and the bad. Look back on it and reflect. How did you feel about what the lady at the supermarket said to you? Did it make you feel happy or upset? Why? Analyzing why you think or feel a certain way helps you get a good look at yourself. It works better than looking in a mirror, trust me. And most importantly, remember that every single thought you have is valid. Even if you think it's ""wrong"" or feel you ""shouldn't think this way"", it's *valid* . Chances are, there are several others who have had every bad thought you have or screwed up as much as you did, sometimes people you'd least expect. Or, alternatively, pick up a hobby. It could be anything related to your interests. You don't have to be perfect, but do it to the best of your ability. The point is to be comfortable with your own company and gain a skill that you can associate yourself with when talking with people. Don't give up now, you still have a ways to go in life! There are so many options out there. I was once in the same pit you were in, but I got out. And I didn't rely on anyone but myself. Sometimes I struggle with myself now and again, but all I need is a second or two to reflect and stop myself from spiraling downwards. To remind myself that there's a good to every bad, the sun will shine tomorrow, and the only end to everything in life is death. Times are hard, but we have to make due with what we have. I'm sure most of those upvotes and these comments are by people who have all been or are in a similar situation. Just remember that you're never alone. You can perservere and get through this, like so many others and I have. Also, is there a reason why therapy isn't helping? "
cyh3lg0,"Well, you have a leg up on me from 4 years ago. In 2012, I was a 24 year old virgin who had never had a job and didn't have any hobbies other than reading politics, playing video games. And I was on my 6th year of undergrad. Little social skills, zero work experience. Now I have a Master's degree, work at two jobs, am trying to get into a PhD program, in a happy relationship, a proficient public speaker, and trying to finish a book. Started off with volunteering at a homeless shelter, and in an undergrad research lab. Then started rock climbing, and met a bunch of cool people there. And it went from there. Suffice it to say, I know where you are coming from. P.M. me if you'd like to talk more. And in reply to your post: Lifting, jogging, etc. I get the feeling you would be good at non-competitive sports and activities like hiking, kayaking, trekking. It's a great way to stay in shape and meet awesome people in a natural way. For the mastery part and confidence, I can't recoomend rock climbing enough."
d3wrcr7,"Me too! Maybe it's because of summer...during the year i had university, so i had to go out, i went out with friends\classmates. But now that's summer i won't see them often, and where i live i have one close friend. And i think ""what if i do nothing on this summer? i don't want to stay at home all day"". I have to get out of the routine. To motivate myself i think that i'm going to do one or two different activities during the week. I'll start with simple things, like play a sport that i love, or go for a walk, or meet with my close friend, and stay in contact with her!"

Being an asshole would be better cause girls would like that. I feel like being ""Nice"" is what i have become cause i stayed home for 2 years. Between 13-15. Im nice cause i have an empty mind nothing else to say. I feel like everyone is better than me. More amazing than me in anyway and have more friends than me and having a lot of people loving and giving them attention them not me . Im not special or unique. Im not good. Im nothing.

I hate being invisible. I dont have anything to say at all.. I depend on porn and girls to be happy.. but i chase approval and attention from girls ""online"" so they give me attention and i feel like im ""worthy"" but nobody gives me the satisfactipn cauze im a horrible person. An asshole. A crude. A egotistical stupid young guy that doesnt know what he is doing in his life... i feel purposeless. I dont feel anything. Happy or sad. Idk what i should feel like... i just feel stupid, foolish, dumb, like a loser.. I try to use getting attention from girls and porn to escape my problems.. but i cant... most i hate about.my self is i fail at everything and im a naive stupid nice guy that doesnt know how to make friemds and i have no qualities. Its the truth. I dont even know what i am anymore. Are my posts the same? "
omcydy,"Medication or therapy?. I’m only 17 but I’ve been dealing with this shit as long as I can remember, I feel constant paranoia, a weird feeling in my chest and can’t even hold my hand out without shaking when on my own. My social anxiety has gotten so bad to the point where I’ve lost all connection with everyone i used to know and it is just getting worse and worse. I’m so unconfident and have terrible self esteem so I can hardly speak to my family confidently let alone strangers, I’m not to sure how to describe it but i cannot do anything without thinking about what I look like doing it whether it’s walking down a street or even just normal mannerisms. I have extreme blushing and sweating problems aswell which can we triggered by things as little as seeing someone i know across the street, for example I saw someone from my old school standing outside a store I was heading too and as soon as they noticed me I started blushing terribly, eyes started watering and instead of going in I turned and walked home. Just from the thought of walking past someone I knew would recognise me. I haven’t had a hard upbringing at all aside from severe anxiety and being the subject of alot of jokes early on in my school career which ik in comparison to alot of others on here is nothing but yet I’m not sure how long I can put up with this. I don’t know anything about medication and whether it can help situations like this but I’m just sick of feeling this paranoia 24/7. If anyone got this far please let me know if you think therapy or medication is a better solution"
g3sjqn3,"bruh, trust me ... you aren't.nnThe only truly defective people are the ones who don't give a shit about anything.

omchpp, I have no idea what to talk about with people. Talk about them? Okay but I still run out of things to say. I have no fucking idea what to do. It's always me asking people questions never the other way. It's always me chasing people and I hate it it's super frustrating It makes me feel like I'm not good enough or likeable It's like I base my self worth on how others reply to me. Many people say I need self improvement but I don't know where to start.. I stopped watching porn 2 days ago I don't have any urges and I deleted all social medias. I don't know where to go from here There is so much to do so little time. So many careers and choices and so many interests And I live in a small fucking town where only soccer thought is available as a hobby. Fucking nothing else. 
dln2ehu," Man I strongly relate to you. So much so that unfortunatley I also have no fucking clue how to fix our problem! What I've told other people that helps me is knowing that you're never alone in this. There are millions of other people out there who look down on themselves as much as you and I do. Never feel as if you're the only one this way and that it's your fault. It isn't. Life is bs. Also, it was a good decision on making a Reddit account! This sub can be very helpful but be sure to surf others too! It's really helped with my depression to see the adorable (r/aww) , cool(r/woahdude) and good (r/humansbeingbros) things that do actually exist in the world we live in. :) Not sure what else to say other than good luck out there!!

5cnk79," How to not feel awkward while being somewhere that is not my house?. I have S.A. I wasn't always this insecure about getting out of my house and going out such as shopping, libraries, malls, open outdoor tables, or other places where there is other people around. I had a bad experience with an ex and he turned out to be a stalker. I was left vulnerable after I ended the relationship with him. He refused to move on and would follow me, text, call, email,and show up to places I would be at. As a result, I stopped going out of my house unless it's for school or work. I switched cars because he knew what car I drove. I drive a lot so it was easy for him to find me on a freeway or street he knew I would be at. So how do I get back in a normal routine. I feel as if I am always being watched. I feel awkward leaving my own house to buy groceries thinking he could appear. I walk quickly, and avoid eye contact with people and also don't talk unless I have to. I practically run into the safety of my car while waiting for my next class to start, or when I'm on my break at work. "
g7xgoc5," Happy to see someone taking it seriously. Hope you get better soon. Whats your condition ? Iam still confused whether i need medication or am i overeating . ..I have panic attacks when i talk , call , walk in front of crowd or when someone call my name( or waves at me from distance). Iam from remote place in india , mental health is not given proper importance or support. "
odl25l,"Feeling hollow. Never doing anything for no reason.. I'm 19 years old and male. I don't consider myself particularly interesting or worth pitying. I don't have any physical or mental disorder. Sometimes when I'm really detached from life, I wake up and look at my room, my family, the hills outside my window and think to myself: ""Is this really the life I'm living?"". Of course, not in the sense that my life is bad or that my life is good, just a WTF moment that brings you back to your world after you stayed in your head for too long. Anyways, the social anxiety part of this post is that I have no friends and no things that I enjoy with a passion. Yet I still have every opportunity to make friends with the people I know, or do things that I might find interesting, or do things that benefit me. But I don't do these things becauss I don't have to do them, or, better yet, because I don't want to. I'm passing a lot of time, with distractions here and there. For now my main goal is hopefully do what my parents wish, go to college and make some money to help them pay the bills etc. Beyond that, after my parents die I really don't know what to do. I don't feel the need to prove myself to anyone nor are there things in this world that I want to do/see/feel/smell and so on. Because there are already a lot of people who do these things or have done them already, there's absolutely nothing I can do that another person couldn't do."
p1yprg," Eye sensitivity and facial muscle tension. Anyone experience facial tension or eye sensitivity when outside and around others? I've been having a lot of tension in my face for over the past decade. It doesn't seem to really get any better and it's come to the point that it's a permanent expression now-if you were looking at me. The muscles in my face only relax when I'm completely alone, and this would include my eyes. This also obviously leads to self-image issues. Today for example: I found it almost impossible to look up while on the bus, the amount of pain in my eyes was unreal, so I found it distracting to look at my phone instead (which isn't something I'd want to do forever). Just wondering if anyone has any experience or info on general tension in the face and eyes due to anxiety? A decade of anxiety and in-numerous medications now, still no clue. "
i7qrgg,"Need a bit of comfort. So basically i'm a 21 year old guy and this summer i went to on a vacation to the sea with my family, this year i really didn't want to go but still... i decided to go. The problem is that, since i have arrived i've been seeing couples, group of friends etc And i also got a huge crush on a girl at the beach... so with my SA anxiety this is like hell, sorry if i bothered you with my story i just wanted to get this off my chest."
fthf8bm,"Hm I can definitely say that I'm currently kinda in the same place. I think a good way to think about it is, in the same way that you are sitting and waiting/hoping that someone texts you or contacts you in some way, the other people that you are probably thinking of contacting are feeling the same thing. Legit everyone is bored as hell right now, a simple wass up can't hurt and would probably be very welcome (just like you would be glad for someone to send that text to you). What I would do and what I have done in the past is just hold my breath, write up a quick 'hey, how have you been' message to someone you've been thinking about messaging, count to 3 and just press send. I can 100% sympathize with the pangs of anxiety that ensue even thinking about doing that, but understand that you really have nothing to lose in doing it, if they don't respond (which they will most likely) you'll be exactly where you are now, so why not? And if and when they do respond, you're slowing working to build a connection with someone because that's what happens when we communicate with one another. And it's ok if you just write it out but can't send it right away. Just make sure that you go back at some point, just hold your breath and press send. And for the isolation, try going for a walk where there will be other people around if that's an option. You don't need to talk to them but I find just being around people helps me feel less alone. (I'm also new to reddit and don't get all the rules so sorry in advance if I messed something up or I'm saying too much)"
brrj9d," Couldn't not cry. In school today I had my lunch and went to sit at my table which is baso a bench. I'd only put one leg over before my friend pushed the bench backwards continuously as a joke bending my leg the wrong way backwards. With people around and the panic I said "" seriously stop my leg!"" (Not outspoken but this was such a panic). She stopped and so I got my other leg over so she then pushed the bench back further when I went to sit down and I fell. I think we'd all agree a combination of that, an entire dining hall of people, I just broke downnnnn. Ik my friend didn't realize. She's a ' normie' and literally never experiences humility. My other friend across the table has it kinda the same so she was like ""stop it's not funny"". God I hate it. I was shaking and just lifting my fork from the food to my mouth was difficult. She was sorry and I just said ""I'm sorry it's just I can't deal with things like that"" Why are we like this?? (Friends still believe I don't have SA) "
dbaywt5,"I see myself as a mild case (at least in comparison to more severe cases) and I have some of the same doubts as you do. Getting an official diagnosis for it would be ideal, but... people.nnWhen I have nowhere to be or no obligations to achieve, I just spend my day in my bedroom. That's it. It makes me feel safe. If there are guests in the house, it's a bit more deliberate. I may be able to go to the kitchen to grab what I call The Polite Cookie and stand there for a while listening to them talk, but then I get this insistent, visceral feeling of *nope* that makes me withdraw again.nnI don't have many friends of my own as I select them very, very carefully, and most of my contacts fall and fade because I'm unable to uphold them. If enough time goes by when I haven't talked with someone, I start thinking that they've forgotten me/hate me now/don't want to be friends anymore and that it would be too awkward to try talking with them... so I won't. It's the feeling of uncertainty.nnGoing outside isn't a problem for me - when I come across people I know or who know me, then it becomes one. I plan my route around them if I see them on the street, duck out if I see a familiar car going by and avoid places where I'm known to the staff (I can't enter any of the local cafes). It's a physical feeling of being unable to face these situations in a same way one might be apprehensive to enter a creepy forest at night. This feeling also applies to places I've never been to where I need to speak with people.nnAt worst, the physical reaction includes wildly beating heart, shaking, unable to talk or stuttering, bit of nausea, getting out of breath and the sudden urge to curl up and die. This is triggered mainly when I need to ask for something, make a presentation, talk with authority figures or make a call (takes about three days of gathering courage to pick up the phone). I have difficulty recalling key words in a conversation that makes it all the more difficult and nerve-wrecking to me. If someone unexpectedly comes up and asks me something, I have to take an uncomfortable minute to remember how to talk while willing my hands to stop shaking.nnUh, so that's what I can think off the top of my head. Of course, there are many other smaller things too, some excepts to the rules I don't make and other mental difficulties that mixes things up for me."
dkctid0," My advice would be to practise saying stupid things and to let people judge you for it. Sometimes when a social event is coming up, I plan ahead...I prepare a joke that I know no one will laugh at or a story that is really dull and I tell it to someone or a small group of people, with the expectation of rejection and judgement or awkward silence. Practising being 'ok' with this kind of situation will really help you to stop running from your anxiety and embrace it instead. I know this sounds counter intuitive but eventually the words you want to say will 'come out' just as you wanted them to. It's a bit like when someone is learning to ice skate, in order to improve they must first learn how to fall over safely and be ok with falling over in order to move on to the more advanced stunts. "
fp34dgp," It sounds like you're just not ready to socialize outside with friends. Break it down into easier, more manageable tasks. You may not be ready to socialize with friends outside, but maybe sitting on your front porch reading a book is anxiety-provoking but manageable or maybe going for a walk is anxiety-provoking but manageable. Whatever it is for you that is challenging but manageable, do that. If you are consistent and slowly take on harder and harder challenges you'll probably eventually be ready to hang out outside with friends. As for not beating yourself up over what happened that's tough and I don't really have a good answer. You sound like you're young. Trust me you're going to hurt people and let people down in your life in far worse ways than what you've described here. Like, if this is the worst thing you ever do to people you'd be a saint. If you work on yourself in the way I've described you at least have something to feel good about and feel proud about. Try not to compare yourself to others and beat yourself up over the fact that you can't go outside whereas other people can with no problem. Focus on improving and on comparing yourself to who you were yesterday and not to who someone else is today. "
nb8hdo," I finally scheduled my license test 😎. I was convinced that i wouldn’t ever do it. Not only do I not want to fail the test but the social interaction part and the anxiety of scheduling and going to an appointment...I put it off for a long time, but i figured that once i actually schedule it (luckily i could do it online) it’ll be over with and i won’t have to dwell over being a failure and shit...I’m still nervous because i don’t know how it works. I don’t know what questions they’ll ask and i’m hoping the person doesn’t try to make small talk or ask me any of those questions older adults ask younger people about their life...The fact that we have to wear masks is nice though because it’s like protection for me, not just from corona lmfao, but it soothes my anxiety..but i finally scheduled it. And my dad actually said that he’s proud of me. I felt like he didn’t understand my social anxiety because of how he’s dismissed some of my feelings, and because of how he’s handled it, but he’s proud of me for doing something as small as scheduling a license test and that did surprise me. For me, getting my license is an important, big and small step towards getting better. Now I can’t use it as an excuse to not get a job. I still don’t know when i’ll be able to do that, but it does remove a barrier. I still have to get used to going outside and stuff. And get used to being outside alone. A license will make that easier. I’m lucky i’m able to take things so slowly...Not everyone can do that. I told myself that if i acknowledge that i’m overthinking than why the fuck am i letting it stop me when i know it’s pointless. Just do something. So i did. "

4yc8of,"Dark  and Cold / Envy of Jenny from Forest Gump / Extremely Hopeless. Over the past days I would say I've been like some of my most depressed I've ever been in my life. My chest will just feel like I'm wearing chains,  and sometimes I'll tear up/ start crying without even realizing that I started crying. Not really one to cry. A lot of this is because (other then just being depressed my entire life) we're going to be moving soon because of money issues. Moving into a much smaller place. The ""happiest"" I am is when I spend like 3 or 4 days in my room without seeing family members. People always recommend talking to family... ~NOT for me~, talking to family always makes everything worse  and I'll immediately afterwards tell myself ""just stop putting yourself in situations where you'll have these lengthy depressing conversations"". A lot of the depression of it is just same old conversations same bullshit. I envy Jenny. I admire how she just like hitchhikes around, trying new things, living life.... I wish I had that not giving a fuck attitude. The things my parent talks about worrying about... Accidentally getting bleach on the carpet when cleaning the bathroom, which white trash cups in the cabinet to keep when we move. That's what you worry about? My family worries about the stupidest fucking shit. I have been at the end of my rope for so so so long. I wish I had the strength to just go. Like walk out the fucking door  and never come back. I have no money, no life. A shell, ""to live doesn't mean you're alive"". I have literally not one friend, online or off. You think at this point in my life I would just not even give a fuck enough to have social anxiety, but I still severely do... Fuck I want to die so bad. All I know is we're moving by the 31st this month, I will not be moving with them... I could not handle that situation, something has to happen for me or idk what I'll do. PS: I made a recent post about how I want to work in adult film because of my SA, but they seriously get like so many applications. I really don't see that working out..."
eik715,"Anyone else’s heart race before anything insignificant?. I saw an old friend who I haven’t seen since 3rd grade, I picked her up and dropped her off at a bar. While I was waiting outside for her...my heart was RACING SO FAST. It calmed down after I realized that it isn’t a heart problem and just what was going on in my mental. I just felt little down afterwards that I was physically freaking out over something so small like meeting an old friend for 5 minute drive. Does anyone else get like this? I was nervous because she is very popular and I am complete opposite of her now. So my brain and body kept worrying and being anxious. It just drained me and I don’t want to feel alone in this way... :("
pfmkcc,"QUESTION. PLS ANSWER.. Hi. I'm posting this to check whether i really do have social anxiety or do not.. Please tell me read patiently and tell what you all think. I live with my uncle family since the day I'm born. When i was 12, i stopped going out anywhere with them because of some family issues. Everyday, I go to school (located far from my house) and back home and i go out to meet my friends in the evening using public bus because my school friends are far from my house. Mostly, we just play football and hangout at the street. When i was 18, i had a new group of friends (not school friends) and we often go out by bike or car. That's when i realized that i don't know so many simple things about the outside world. There were so many times I've been laughed and humiliated. Example :- 1) I don't know which fuel is for bike or cars in petrol station. 2) I don't know anything about motorcycle or cars because i don't have one. 3) I don't know what to order in MacDonald's. 4) There was one time i ate the wrong burger in Mcd and my friends laughed at me. 5) I don't know how to find seat in movie theater. 6) I don't know how and where to register in hospital. The list goes on. Because of this i have low self-esteem. Whenever i made simple mistakes my friends laughed at me, my mind would go blank and feel heaviness on my chest but i would try to cover it up by laughing along. Everytime i went back home i just went mad at myself for humiliating myself. So, i only go to places where i know how things work. For example, i can go alone and eat alone at a very crowded restaurant because i know how things work there. I avoid going to a place that I don't know how things work even if i was with my friends because i don't like being laughed and humiliated. Now i'm 24 and often i get past images of embarrassment and humiliations. I would blame my self and get stress because of it. I'm a guy who wants people to respect me but everything is upside down now. I have been staying at home for almost 2 years now because of this pandemic. I only go out of the house if i needed to buy stuff. Now i have to go to Vaccine centre. I feel nervous not because of crowd but because of I've never been there and i don't know how things work there. So based on my situation, what do you think? Do i have social anxiety or not?"
mj4hsk," Did/do I have social anxiety ?. Ok so basically I discovered that social anxiety was a thing like a year ago lol. So in my relatively short life (Im an 18 yo dude) , i had a period which went from 12 to 14 where I would be afraid to be seen in public, I'd hate to go out with my family. Every time Id see o group of kids my age, I would get nervous and try to not look at them fearing they would come over and make fun of me. I was made fun of for 2 out of the 3 years at my middle school, which corresponded to that period of my life. So Im asking if it is normal to have had these feelings of dread of being seen outside with my parents. I still don't like it today, but It is not as bad. Currently, if I see individuals my age, especially girls, I start to get un comfortable, I don't blush, or anything, I just start to realise how awkward I am, and after the social situation has ended, the frustration sinks in and I start obsessing over that event and start hating my self for not having spoken enough or engaged in a conversation. Are these some signs of social anxiety or just me being my shy self ? While this problem is pretty much almost non existent, when I talk to people older than me (ex: cashiers, bros at the gym, random dudes) I completely lose it if its individuals of the opposite sex. For example, the other day, me and my family were helping out this group of girls that whose car was stuck in sand close to a beach. My father, a confident man, offered them help (ofc not me, I would have never have walked up to them LOL), and so we started pushing the car. While my dad was talking to them, I was there all quiet, minimal talk. Soon the other girls joined the effort, and I got even more uncomfortable. After we rescued them, we said good bye and proceed to go home. During the whole, car ride, I thought to myself ""why are u so stupid, u should have talked to them U SHY MF"", in other words da frustration was real. The next day my mom was like ""why didn't you talk to them, you should have"", which makes feel even more shit.. So my questions remains, did/do I have social anxiety? Can anyone relate ? "

t4bv5u,"I feel so pathetic when someone younger than me has had more socially experience.. Just wanted to rant about this. But the other day I was at my bf house (M23) and he was on speaker phone with his younger sister who’s 18 and freshman in college. I was over hearing their conversation and she was talking about a wild frat party her and friends went to other night and how she and like 10 other girls are gonna be going on a beach trip staying in a house in Panama City. Me a (F21) has never been to a frat party in my life, and has never even been on a beach trip with friends or even a friend for that matter, I’ve only went with my family and my boyfriend which I am very thankful for. But I can’t help but to feel jealous and pathetic when someone younger than me has done more in a week than I’ve done in my lifetime. Even tho I know you can’t compare yourself to other peoples life’s and everyone goes thru life in different paces, but it stills makes me insecure and causes me to avoid getting to know his sister more because I feel super anxious and try to hard to impress her and it’s obvious, when it should be the other way around. I remember one time to when she asked me if I could buy her and her friend alcohol one night and I felt pretty cool till I actually met up with them and as soon as I got into their car for the money I instantly got that feeling you get like back in high school when you somehow end up sitting with the popular kids at lunch or something. Then when I was inside buying the drinks I just felt like a huge loser who was being used for the my ID that I’ve barley used myself. But idk it’s just one those things that I just sit back and kinda laugh at myself cause it’s so pathetic😅 Let know if y’all can relate?"
oz15i6," requesting time off work. Hi, I graduated high school a couple months ago and have a summer job working at the front gate at a local state park. I committed to working June through August when I was hired. My supervisor asked me when I was hired if I was going on vacation at all this summer. I was nervous about making a bad first impression, so I told him I wouldn't be going on vacation, even though I am. I know I should've told him right away, but the right time never came and I haven't told him. Now, I'm leaving for vacation in two weeks away and nobody at work knows. My supervisor works in a different area of the part, so I haven't interacted with him more than hello and goodbye once or twice. I don't have a reputation with him. We are also short-staffed, and taking off time for my vacation (I would miss six days) would be an inconvenience, especially because I haven't provided much notice (one week is the unspoken minimum to request a day off, but for multiple, planned days, I feel like a month in advance would be expected). I would need to request off a Saturday and Sunday, and then the following Thursday through Sunday. I know this is really dishonest, and I can't believe I'm even considering this, but maybe I should request the second Thursday through Sunday off, and pretend to get Covid for the first set of days?? Or does anyone have a better ""story"" that isn't quite as dishonest, but still shifts some of the blame from me? I actually want to request working until the end of September (longer than my initial agreement), which would be welcome by my supervisor. Maybe I can through this in somehow to ease the blow to him? I'm not really sure what I'm worried about. I think it's just the thought of being an inconvenience to someone. This job is really stressful because everyone at the park, from the highest ranking staff to the lowest employees like me, depends on one another to operate the park. Even though I'm really young and new, I still have major responsibilities. I feel like I would let down the team by taking this vacation. And it would also mean an awkward conversation with someone I barely know. Any advice on how to communicate this situation? I'm not really sure how to convey this in an honest way without being an incredible disappointment. "

ehjg45w,"Hiking is nice but I don't like when I meet too many people around while hiking on my own, but in general I like it along with photography though my shots are far below medicore.nnReading books is awesome. It's like movies, but in much batter pace, like you have opportunity to get lost in thoughts somewhere in fictive world.nnI study building constructions and always was passionate about architecture so sometimes I design own house. It's not just one hobby it's several hobbies packed together.nI do own floorplans, interior/exterior/garden designs, sometimes I make some piece of furniture, create 3d models, play with rendering engine and perspective to get correct shot.nOnce I was making shot of children room and decided that it would be nice if there was a child on final image so I had to learn how to make 3d model of it, decide what this little kiddo will be doing on image and think of that situation. I also had to dress up this child, so I decided to make a cloth simulation and had to actually learn how to do that and how to sew some basic clothes. nnI love these fictive world's so badly so I even tend to create own fantasy worlds aswell and found passion in studying some middle age facts and ""facts"", and then making own worlds with its own daily routine, facts and ""facts"" and sometimes coming up with some crazy complicated mathematical formulas that are supposed to represent real events in these worlds. Once I've read longsword fencing manual and spent countless hours running around with broom stick, pretending it's sword on purpose to invent some interesting modular text handled fencing simulator. Haha what a stupid idea was that, but I was happy for countless hours, so it was definitely worth it.nNow I'm also thinking about archery....nnAlso gaming might be a good hobby, the only social-like hobby I have, is playing world of Warcraft. Especially older versions of game without matchmaking mechanics where you actually were forced to speak with people to make anything happen. It's just bounch of anonymous people with same hobby so it's much easier to open up little bit. I also met some people whom I consider to be close friends this way, even though I've never met them, we can talk about whatever.

I don't think too much about it while walking around normally, but everytime I tried jogging with headphones I went mental. nnAlso, whenever I wear headphones suddenly all other sounds and noises in the world seem to become much louder. So when I'm running with headphones on I feel like a suffocating elephant."
dpnkh1r,"Really, I have tried that twice before. The people on there are generally a lot older than me and it's not that popular in my city. There only ever seem to be LGBT meetings, hiking and a vegetarian group. Occasionally there's some which would be suitable for me, but the last time I went to one it was full of CREEPS. I'm a guy, but most of the men there were just creepy and using it to try and hit on women."

6tpyyu, Can't sleep anxiety worse than ever before. Lately I've been finding it increasingly difficult to get to sleep as my anxiety is really bad atm. I try to distract myself from it by watching silly little videos or surfing the net but I just can't switch off. I can't stop thinking. It's really becoming an issue now. When I do get to sleep I'm waking up in a panic and sweating out at like 5 or 6 am and then because I'm so tired from not getting to sleep until late I end up falling back asleep and waking up late which leaves me really tired all day. I wake up more tired than I am when I'm going to bed. Anyone got any suggestions on how I can switch off at night to get to sleep earlier or how to stop thinking so much about everything or just any ideas on how to not let anxiety affect my sleep? Thanks in advance.

dm0mtb2,"Go for it.  I'm guessing you invited some friends but they were all too busy (or too lame) to go, right?  This is your chance to prove both to yourself and to others that you are not dependent on others to have a great time.  As someone who has done similar things, it will do you good.  For example, I try to plan a monthly hiking trip.  I invite friends, half the time no one wants to go, so I go anyway, and still enjoy myself."
g2bf2p,"Indecisive mind (MANY, NOT Clear Choices). I have kind of rebellious mind. My mind always argue with me and now I am quite stressed out and depressed. 😢 In almost everything I do such as whether I should go out of the house to take a phone call or stay inside the house, my mind argue with me. I want to take a phone call outside because I feel shy and awkward calling when there are people listening. But, my mind keeps pestering me in unexplainable ways. Also, in talking, many times I cannot decide whether I should be friendly or teasing. Another example, I cannot decide whether I should talk whatever in my mind or filter for good stuff only. (Note-if I say whatever is in my mind, I kind of narrate everything happening around me to other people. This always make them bored of me. Because, I don't have anything else to say) 3rd example, when I met my Housemate, I cannot decide whether I should say Hi or directly talk with him about anything. How to train my mind to choose one decision and move on instead dwelling on the worry and stress for so long? This type of my mind makes me wanna die.

hyim4x,"Drinking with friends, and parents. I’m 24, and still live with my parents, I pay rent and do everything they ask. Anyways, growing up I had no friends, so I’ve never really been invited out to chill until now. So all of this is new for me, and my parents. I met a friend at my job who I’m really close with, and I’ve been over for lunch/cook outs before. Tomorrow I’m going to a cookout, but Im going to be drinking, of course I’m gonna be responsible and catch a Uber to and to come back to my house. My parents don’t like the idea of me drinking which makes me nervous for some reason. I’ve drank alone and know what I can handle (they don’t know this), and they are making it seem like I, gonna be committing illegal crimes or something. I just want to be normal like everyone else and do normal people shit. My mom drinks literally every single night anyways... Is anyone else held back by parents, and have social anxiety stemming from them?"

nbv1e8,"Im so embarrassed rn and idk why. I had a football match today and I always feel so embarrassed after them. I messed up I took a shot and it went way wide. Idk I was running up and just hit it with my bad foot which sometimes works for me but I fucked up. The main thing I’m embarrassed about it like I always end up sprinting up the pitch. I don’t mean to but like I just start running and it’s really fast, I’m not purposely sprinting like it just happens idk. Anyway like I sprint up the pitch and then I always loose the ball and it’s just so embarrassing. Like I wreck myself speeding up the pitch and fuck up and it happens all the time. In one match I ran up the pitch and I heard some girl say like jeez she’s quick or something but she said it in a jokey way as in like why tf is she running so fast for no reason and I was so embarrassed. I’m just really overthinking this match and I can’t sleep. I know it sounds dramatic but I just hate embarrassing myself or the thought that people might be thinking I’m trying to show off by running fast when I don’t mean to do it. Like one time in training we were doing a drill in pairs and the other girl was like can we take it slow (we had to do the drill 10 times) and I said yea but I just started and I went fast. Like I wasn’t trying to show off idk like I just start running and it’s fast paced but I’m not purposely doing it. I’m just ranting idk why this is keeping me up I just feel so embarrassed. I’m literally the last person who would want to try show off and I hate that people might think I’m showing off when I’m not :("

jvge2e,"My experience of stepping WAY out of my comfort zone and posing topless for an art exhibition in front of a close male friend. Hi all! I hope that you and your families have been keeping well throughout these past few months - I know that it can be a very worrying time for people mentally, financially and physically, so please don't be afraid to reach out and speak to people if you need help. I am a mum to 3 wonderful daughters and wife to an amazing husband and we live in a fairly rural area within the UK and absolutely love being out in the countryside. I work as a fundraising manager for a Cancer Charity and absolutely love my job and being able to make a real difference to people's lives. As I had been on Furlough for the past few months (now back at work!) I had been looking through old photos and files and thought that I would share my personal experience of stepping way out of my comfort zone and overcoming a mountain of anxiety that I have experienced for most of my life. To set some background, approximately 5 years ago I joined a local walking group within our village who meet up every Sunday to go for a long walk (with a nice pub stop at the end!). I became good friends with one of the members of the group, Alan, who is a retired photographer and artist and as he is now in his mid 70's he enjoys keeping fit and socialising with the walking group. Every year our village hosts a photography and art exhibition to promote local artists in the area and also raise money for local charities. Two years ago, during our pub stop after our walk on a Sunday, Alan was discussing that he had been planning on entering the art show that year but that a model that he had hired for his exhibition - *Sexuality in the Media vs Everyday Life* had cancelled at the last minute and that he was feeling quite down about this (art is a great escape and freedom for Alan after the death of his son a few years ago). After some discussion (partly to help a friend in need and to carry out my resolution to step out of my comfort zone) I agreed that I would volunteer to take the model's place and pose for Alan's exhibition. It would involve posing topless whilst Alan made a plaster upper body cast of myself which he could then adapt for the art show in various forms. Body confidence and anxiety has always been a massive issue for me - I do have large breasts which I have always been self-confident about and has always left me nervous to wear a bikini etc. However, I had never had an opportunity like this before and, knowing how much art means to Alan, I thought why not? Alan is a good family friend and I knew that I could trust him to undertake the job with professionalism. I even managed to agree that all donations for his exhibition would go to the charity that I work for! When I got home that evening I sat down with my husband and daughters and discussed the situation to make sure that they would be okay with it - much to my surprise they were all very supportive and glad that I was challenging myself in this way! My husband knows Alan and trusts him. Fast forward 2 weeks I woke up early on a sunny, crisp Saturday Autumn morning and made the short drive over to Alan's house for the plaster cast to be made. I was incredibly nervous and apprehensive but was so glad that I was challenging myself. I rang the doorbell and Alan's wife answered the door and warmly greeted me with a smile and invited me in for a coffee - after a good chat with her and Alan I made my way to the garage that housed Alan's studio. Whilst Alan got ready I very nervously undressed to just a pair of knickers (Marks and Spencer's finest lol!) whilst chatting to Alan. It was one of the most surreal moments I have experienced - exposing my breasts in front of a close friend whilst Alan applied the cast chatting away as usual about village life (photo behind the scenes)  and#x200B; In all, it took a few hours and I was so pleased with the end result (I look so proud lol!). Alan was so professional throughout everything and made me feel so relaxed and calm - he is such an amazing friend. The art exhibition went really, really well and a good sum of money was raised for fantastic local charities.  and#x200B; I am so proud of myself (I hope my family are too!) for stepping out of my comfort zone and overcoming massive personal body confidence issues that I have experienced for virtually all of my life. Alan has been shielding throughout the COVID pandemic due to his age, but I have been delivering his weekly shopping essentials to him and his wife for the past few months so we always make sure we have a good catch up - I'll make sure I show him the post this week. All my love and stay safe, Sarah xxx"
g02qptb, Especially at the pool god forbid someone I KNOW sees me in a bathing suit! Other people...dont care. 
n2lipz, RIP to all the hobbies I lost due to my social anxiety.. I'll probably never skateboard again cuz I got heckled at the park for being a girl skater. Wasted 60 bucks and a discord account on Overwatch. The book club I started but no one came to meetings. Let's not forget my YouTube channel. Can't even imagine the amount of money I've wasted on tabletop board games that no one ever wants to play. One day I'll explore them again but I'm not ready yet. 
etslz84,"I’m so sorry this happened to you. And then you had to drive an hour back home for nothing, that’s awful. You know, I took drama courses once to sort of get out of my shell. It was the very first class and we all had to stand in front of the room one at a time and talk about literally anything for like five minutes. So I stupidly thought I’d talk about this time I drew a swastika in my neighbors backyard. I thought they’d find it funny and the whole class would laugh and everyone would like me. Instead the man leading the acting workshop cut me off as soon as I said the word swastika and just carried on to the next student. I went to sit down and felt the class staring at me and then had to endure the rest of the 5 hour course, but of course my enthusiasm to try and break out of my shell is all but crushed. It took so much time and mental preparation and cold sweats and sleepless nights to get myself to attend this course to try and make some progress with interpersonal skills and it was gone just in an instant. So the remainder of the course I’m barely participating because I’m hoping no one notices I’m beet red and struggling to hold back tears. And I just wanted to be home in bed under the covers in the dark hidden away from everything. And then on the train ride home which also took about an hour, that’s when I’m sobbing hard but quietly to myself in a packed nyc subway train. So of course that traumatizing experience set back all the progress I’ve made in the past several months or so, months of exposure therapy and just dealing with life and such. So I sincerely empathize with you after reading your post."
ez0ffpw,"Hey dude, I'm laying in bed right now and just thinking about how hard it was for me to overcome my social anxiety, but I have done it. Now my ""goals"" were extremely high since I had always desired to be able to talk to anyone, speak my opinion regardless of who is in the room, and be comfortable around women. But I've managed to be able to do those things, not all the time, but most of the time. Even if I feel anxious I can push myself to do it. About three years ago, I was almost kicked out of university because I skipped the first six months. One of the reasons was because of my intense anxiety during group work, sitting in lecture halls and the likes. I'd also fall into periodic depressions where I'd lay in bed, masterbate and not brush my teeth and just watch some youtube videos's. Obviously that behaviour made me hate myself even more. I could never talk to women, and was a virgin. Point is I have changed dramatically i'd say. So it is possible. What you need to do is read up on cognitive behavioural therapy and rational emotive behavioural therapy. I did it on my own by using books particularly (1) Feeling Good Handbook by David Burns (2) Feeling Good by David Burns (3) When panic attacks by David Burns (3) A guide to rational living by Albert Ellis  and#x200B; The solution lies in seeing the irrationality of your thoughts that lead to your social anxiety and low self-esteem. You learn to question these beliefs, see that they're false, and then replace them with more rational ways of thinking. At the same time, you push your ass to socializine, to take risks, to make yourself uncomfortable.  and#x200B; I for example did many things such as approaching a 100 women (complete strangers), starting a conversation with them and asking them on dates. Got rejected 92 times. I did ""shameAttacking"" exercises probably a 1000 thousand times. These are exercises where you deliberately do something foolish in public such as singing on the train, telling people your insecurities, walking shirtless outside and so forth. People will obviously judge and laugh at you, but you see that the world doesn't come to an end. Took a course in public speaking at my school.  and#x200B; I still work on it though. Part of it is a fear of going back if I'm being honest (although that's highly unlikely. But another part is that it is just so much fun to grow, and life is a 100x times better without constant social anxiety.  and#x200B; POINT IS THAT IT IS HARD BUT IT'S POSSIBLE IF YOU PUSH YOUR FUCKING ASS LIKE I DID."
edl16bj,"Social anxiety is a bitch. In middle school I would sometimes hide in a patch of trees on my school campus while all the other kids played sports with each other. I didn't always do this but it eventually became a habit and it got to the point where I would just beeline it to the area because I was so freaked out about anyone noticing me. nn&amp;#x200B;nnI honestly don't know what advice I can give when it comes to dealing with your siblings, but overall just going to eat alone will help you in the long term. At the very least, you'll become comfortable with eating alone and at best you might make some friends if some people are kind enough to invite you to sit with them.  I don't know what your brother and sister are like but if they ever ask about it they'll hopefully understand. nn&amp;#x200B;nnAvoidance behaviour can seep into other aspects of your life if you get into the habit of doing it. I spent far too long doing things like that and I'm still trying to make up for it "
l279qm," Would rather be in a burning building than talk to people. The fire alarm went off somewhere in my building. It was very quiet so I don’t think I have to evacuate, but since I’m all alone I was too scared to go outside and ask people. Sometimes I think that I’m doing ok, but when stuff like this happens it’s very apparent I wouldn’t be able to live like this for the rest of my life. Anyone relate? "
cxkglic,"If that's the intent then why not make the poll, ""Would you rather endure physical pain"" or ""Endure social anxiety"". The important thing here is to eliminate any bias that could come from the wording of the survey itself. Which in this study seems to be ultimately accomplished by making sure the connotation of both choices is equal in nature. You already have to deal with voluntary response bias...any other bias you can rule out will make this study more significant. "
8yf9rh," Work has made me feel really bad about myself. I just started this new job as an electrician about 2 months ago. I have always had a stuttering problem since I've been born.... I feel like whenever I'm really happy I don't stutter as much but recently I feel like shit. Everybody at my work seems to be really outgoing and we often take alot of breaks and I just feel weird because I never really have anything to say.. I feel like people think I'm weird and when they say something to me my mind goes blank and I can't think of really anything to say. I used to think I was really funny but I feel like I'm losing my vocab and words really don't even make sense to me. It's really hard for me to focus on even what someone is trying to say and I feel like I can't even comprehend and keep a conversation going. This really brings down my self-esteem. Lately I've been avoiding my friends and I just don't feel like I'm myself anymore. I feel like I can't even handle any responsibility and my mind is constantly racing if negative thoughts and I just don't seem happy anymore. When someone shows me a funny video I hardly even find it funny and I just fake laugh so I don't seem weird. I feel like I'm always worried and I'm constantly thinking of the same thoughts all day. I can't seem to enjoy myself anymore. I feel like a boring person to be around and I feel like my personality is completely gone. I honestly don't know what to do anymore or what to think. Everyday I get home from work I just sit down and watch the time go by and worry about work the next day. I've been feeling this way for about 3 weeks now. I feel like I don't have any emotions anymore or even know how to feel... I'm constantly worried about fucking up and when I'm assigned a task at work it's difficult for me to focus and be organized. I'm not sure if my ADHD has something to do with this and I'm not sure what answers I'm really trying to get here... I just feel like I've completely lost myself.. I'm tired of being this way.. I don't have health insurance but I am going to see a doctor the 14th . I honestly can't even read pin point how I feel. I've been working with the same person everyday and alot of the time I just watch and whenever I get to run off and do my own thing I usually start to feel better about myself. I just feel really confused and lost... Whenever I talk to someone my response is usually ""really""? Or ""hell yeah"". I constantly tell myself I'm stupid and just beat myself up. I never really felt this way but I just feel lost in my thoughts ever since I've gotten this job. I've never really been great at conversations and it's hard to enjoy life if you can't even talk to people.. This has completely taken over my life and honestly I don't know how to feel anymore. Nothing is making me happy and I dread to go to work. Don't get me wrong everybody at work is really awesome and it's laid back but I just feel mentally slow and antisocial and I feel like people are bored around me... I don't really know how much of this over thinking I can take.. As I look through all the posts I feel like I do have social anxiety.. I've always been a weed smoker but recently I've quit to see if I can get my memory back but I feel like weed was the only thing I looked forward to and made me happy and I've take that away from myself. I haven't had a good time in along time. I'm not sure if I have a disorder or all of this over thinking has just went out of control. Honestly I'm scared to even see a doctor because I feel like I can't explain myself that good. I feel like I've just lost all hope and my whole perception on life has changed. I guess you could probably say I have depression but honestly I really don't have much to be depressed about other then trying to make conversation .. I feel blank minded and I feel like I have no energy. I always feel slow. Can someone give me some advice..? Anything helps :/ "
oc1a8s," Venting and Seeking Help. I don't know how to move forward in this world. I know none of you are my therapist, but if you're willing to listen please grant me that. I never had a therapist, nor friends who would care, bar one but they're dealing with their own troubles and have no time for mine. I turned 22 a little over a month ago and I haven't done a damn thing. I missed out on my formulative years cause I was too busy playing games, watching videos, and panicking whenever I was around people. It was seriously the most pathetic thing. Thing is, I wanted desperately to talk with my classmates and put myself out there. I wanted to be confident, and I never hated a single person around me. Only myself. I was lightly bullied by a lot of people who targeted me for seemingly no reason, other than that I was weak and an easy target. There's a few instances I still remember, such as when one of my classmates told me ""nobody wants you here"" out on the basketball court during gym class, in front of everybody, and nobody said a thing. Even the teacher ignored it. I stood there, wandering back and forth for about a minute trying to get any kind of attention, but nobody said a thing. I walked back towards the school building, which was a good eigth mile away, visible right from the court. I walked slowly and nobody, not even the teacher stopped me or said anything. That was the first time I felt that alone, that was 7th grade. That year, little stuff happened all the time, but my mind's repressed most of it. I remember though, one time on the bus back home, a bunch of kids were calling out to me from the back. I wish I responded, they went on for a while. I was too scared. I looked back at all these types of events last week, and I discovered it happened usually once a year with a different person. I'm not one to hold onto that shit, so I forgave them all, especially since it never got too serious, which I'm thankful for. However, I think the mental toll has been paid, and I'm pretty fucked cause of it. A life of failure and disappointment later, me abandoning people I loved to talk to, me cutting ties, me being lazy and not taking action when I need to, all led to me being here now. A 22 year old nobody, no direction, nobody who will give me an objective, straight answer, no relationship experience, no money, nothing to show and already feeling like I'm in the shoes of a geezer. I still have my dreams though, so many dreams. Like most other people, I would give so much just for a chance to go back and do it again, but who says it wouldn't just end up the same way? Two of my biggest insecurities were my *name* of all things, and my appearance. I was an ugly kid, a little better off now but not by much. So, realistically, my only choice is to carve forward. Still, I can't talk to people despite trying so, so hard, I have no confidence in myself whatsoever. Seriously, I don't know if it's the mild porn addiction, the lack of support or successes or whatever, but my confidence is through the damn floor. I know I'm self aware in most things, though I'm sure I got a million blind spots too, but the things I see are torturing me endlessly. I want so many things in life. I want to move to San Francisco, finish off my (planned) last two years of college there, try to put myself out there one last time. I want to spend nights with a small group of friends by the beach and dock, in the city just enjoying life. I want to learn to skateboard. I want to learn Jiu Jitsu to gain some confidence, and to be able to protect myself and others, at least a little. I want to learn to make comics or manga or anything of the sort, and put what I have in mind into reality. I want to further my programming and finish my game I've been working on for the past year. I want to start a YouTube channel so I'd always have people to talk to who were interested in the same stuff as me, so I'd have an outlet to just talk. I want to be more confident. I want to be unreasonably confident. I want to put myself out there every chance I see a positive outcome from, even if it's a gamble. I want to be kind to everybody, regardless of my political beliefs. I want to help people just cause. I want to live an adventurous life. I want to fall in love. I want to start a family, raise 4+ happy kids in San Fran, send them to school and teach them to be strong and wise, and to enjoy their lives. I'm currently stuck in my mom's house in suburbia, 8k in debt and running my days out as a wagie. I already feel so old. I don't know what to do. I can't hold most conversations. I'm a coward. Everybody's moving ahead in life, except for me. Thanks for reading, if you have any advice, please say whatever's on your mind. "
g62ykop," I want you to know that you are not alone and that you have the ability to change your situation. I was going through a very similar thing a few years ago. I thought I was so ugly and couldn't bear to leave my house for years. The only way I changed that was by going outside and talking to people. I started out just going to the grocery store early in the morning. There weren't many people so it helped me get used to being in public. I tried to get out and talk a little more and it got easier. Take small steps. You can do it!! Have you talked to your girlfriend or family about what's going on? Edit: Also..If you want to, move in with your girlfriend!!!! She loves you. "
ol3w0a,"Applying for jobs. So im undiagnosed but i believe i have social anxiety. Ive felt like this for a reasonably long time, most of my secondary school experience. I dont thinks its necessary to go into detail but main things i struggle with are being alone in a new environment, doing something wrong when no one i know is present, always feeling like im doing something/going to do something wrong, meeting new people and a whole other bunch. These main ones are making it a struggle for me to find a job. Im 16 years old and currently looking for a job. My first and only place i worked was just a trial shift at a restaurant place on a beach. They told me what to do for the guests inside and outside, where to put dishes, how to make the teas and serve condiments and everything else. It wad fine for the first hour or two as it was only drinks being served but i realized i couldnt carry drinks without it spilling onto the tray. The cutlery was simple, however when they ordered sandwiches no one told me if they should be given cutlery or not so i did anyway. Condiments were easy up until i was told i hadnt put spoons with them and put them on a plate. Food seemed risky before i even started and proved so, as the few times i did serve i would forget what food it was or almost tip the food off the plate. I stayed away from food and drink unless it was tea and focused on cutlery, condiments and cleaning. I wasnt sure whether to take people finished dishes if they were still at the table, so i didnt, and only cleared up tables with no one on it. About 4 hours 45 minutes into my 6 hour shift, the manager sent me home with some money and said i wasn't really ready pretty much. I need and want a job gor the summer at least,and most places ive looked at seem relatively okay such as retail or hotels, but many are described as busy or fast paced or attention to detail. These kind of put me off and i dont feel confident in getting the job. Anyone have any suggestions or advice for what i could do? TL;DR First shot at job wasnt great, not confident in finding new one."

It's surreal how many people just aren't that concerned about it, beaches are populated, theme parks are open, restaurants are busy.

nuq4t6,"Not as nervous when I feel like my presence is wanted. I’m (20F) not officially diagnosed with anxiety or social anxiety, but I do get very anxious when dealing with new people to talk to. I fear getting judged for being me and it stresses me out when I have to be with someone I don’t know very well. But there always seems to be a case where I’m around people I don’t know well and become less nervous. So I’ve worked at the pool for years. I’m comfortable there and am known as the older staff now. We get new people all the time now and it’s nerve wracking to interact with the new people. But an old coworker of mine cracked some jokes with me while the new people were around us and it then evolved into me being comfortable because these new people liked my humor and I felt comfortable. I really like those situations because these people simply just listening and enjoying what I’m saying really eases my stress. On the other hand there can be new people who are associated with my coworkers that know how weird I can be sometimes and so they stay away from me. Those people are the ones I feel stressed about being on a shift with. Idk if anyone else feels less stressed and anxious when new people seem to like you or if an old friend helps you ease into talking with new people, but it’s nice when that happens"

lq0abu,"I kinda feel like I've hit a dead end since 2019. So, long story short, early 2019 I finished my exams, I've been home since then just doing things I like, had a panic attack in August somewhere that year and have had derealization since which makes me feel surreal 24/7 and more anxious than ever. Since I finished my exams I haven't had any friends, barely go outside (typically I spend a lot of weeks inside before going outside and that's just a really short walk with my father usually) and I think social anxiety is the main culprit here. Basically, my daily routine looks like this: wake up around 9-10AM, chat a little with my parents, do the dishes, eat lunch at roughly 12:30PM, spend the rest of the afternoon in my room playing games, listening to music and if I feel motivated enough I learn webdev stuff, practice drawing or study Japanese. At 6PM I have dinner, and after that I usually play games and watch anime until 11PM, then I go downstairs and just fuck around on my tablet until I go to bed (usually 11:45PM-12:30AM). Rinse and repeat every day. Now normally that's all fine and dandy, but I kinda feel like I'm caught in a Groundhog Day loop since that day in August and that I'm slowly going crazy. I also worry that I'm fucking up my 20s (I was 19 IIRC when I finished my exams, I'm 21 now, becoming 22 in a few months) since they're pretty much *the* time in your life, and I've already pretty much lost the first two. It's like a pretty vicious cycle, since the derealization and social anxiety (and one other thing) keeps me from going outside, getting a job (never had one), etc, and staying indoors all day and doing nothing but browsing reddit and stuff like that amplifies the derealization and social anxiety. It feels like I'm going to be like this for all eternity at this point and I'm really slowly losing hope. Doesn't help that the pandemic is also a thing, of course. Just venting here, idk anymore. If I just got rid of that terrible derealization and social anxiety, had a more varied daily routine including a job and got some friends I think I would be in a much better place right now, but I just can't seem to end this cycle."
dcho2je," I always found it impossible to make friends in class, not sure why but it always just felt weird and forced. Is there greek life at your school? That usually helps a lot of people make new friends. I had the same issue and one thing I did was sign up for tennis classes at our university's gym. Just little things like that which force you to socialize will help a lot! Hang in there, but also try not to stress yourself out about it. Also getting a job, particularly somewhere around campus might help :) "
l8lf2w," Feeling... guilty?. Probably the strangest part of having social anxiety for me is this feeling of 'guilt' I get sometimes. I don't even really know why I feel it, so it's hard to explain. But every so often; if I have been out communicating with strangers in any way, even if all went smoothly, nothing awkward happened, I will go to bed that night feeling super guilty and shameful- to the point I get nauseous. Because I know I still didn't truly act like myself. And I feel horrible knowing people have perceived me as a completely different person than I really am. Like I should never go outside and interact with anyone ever again because every time I do, I do damage to my outward image and reputation. I get so embarrassed knowing that I always misrepresent myself. It's like... going out wearing some super ridiculous clothes, and you know everyone is judging you based on what you're wearing, and you just want to tell them ""this isn't what I actually wear! I'm not really like this!"" but you can't. Just the thought of people seeing me as some shy, awkward person tears me up inside because it's not at all how I really am or how I want to be. I feel like an imposter. "
9r8sk3," Do you have massive amounts of pent up anger and frustration too?. It might seem paradox since being anxious and introverted is more or less the opposite of being confrontional and angry, but there are times where I just can feel all my anger and frustration like a giant ocean trapped beneath an ice cap. I'm not sure if I'd call myself a violent person, but I phantasize abut retribution in some form or another, be it more radical or just doing small things to ""get even"". I notice it more when I'm working out or start to get drunk. Sometimes it's not not even about real people, I just view abstract things like life and God as people and get angry at them. Start thinking like, ""...to be born just to end up like this"". I can turn on people pretty quickly even to those who didn't do anything to me. In my mind I fabricate a story where they attempted to make fun of me directly or indirectly. I've read stories on here where some of you were genuinely mistreated by coworkers, strangers etc. Even though I'm not a courageous person, but I've adopted a, ""eat or get eaten"" mentality. When I enter a new social circle or meet new people that I have to deal with for a certain period of time, there's a subtle hostility in my attitude. I'll make sure to assert a certain amount of dominace to let the other person know if they want to play any games with me, this shit won't fly. Depending on the situation I can be more or less rude. It's important to let those people know, right from the beginning, to know whats up. In my opinion, if people do not fear any consquences they are more likely to 'misbehave' or do things they know they shouldn't do. This goes for pretty much everything and everyone. Anyway sometimes it feels like I'm drowing in anger and frustration. This, along with several other things, defines me as a person more than I would like to. What I wrote goes beyond the normal SA stuff so I wondered how many of you feel same or can atleast relate. "
fb4zeax," ""People always assume that I either hate them"" God, I can relate to this so much. If I don't talk, then people think I hate them all, when in reality, I'm just a naturally shy person. I met a coworker who bragged about hooking up with this attractive Mexican, and he went into detail about how he ate her out at the pool, they were drunk, etc. Guess what? No one batted an eye. If I said something like this, then *everyone* will start talking about me. "
d09yj61,"I can definitely relate and have seen that a great bit of people in this subreddit have dealt with similar issues (controlling, critical, and mentally abusive parents).  I'm 21, still living at home, and just beginning to realize how their controlling and critical nature has affected me over the years.  I looked up to my parents my whole life and thought they were the smartest people, and compared the my friends' families they were very well off and I wanted to be just like them when I got older.  Well, I've grown up quite a bit and have realized how miserable they are even though they are financially very well off.  My dad is the type of person to judge people when we are out in public (he's too fat, she's got tattoos all over, etc etc) and I believe I grew up thinking everyone was as judgmental as him which I believe contributed to my social anxiety.  But I can't blame the fact that I have SA on him as I'm sure it's the result of many factors both internal and external. Just as you, my social anxiety got better when I moved out but I had to move back home and my depression/anxiety has skyrocketed since then.  Hope you figure your situation out, I can definitely relate to you and feel for ya."
f5b6dv,"I came to the point of crying over my social anxiety/shyness. I just need to get this off my chest. I just fucking wish so badly that i had the ability to connect with people. Throughout my entire high school career, i couldnt make friends because of my shyness and low self esteem. Im in uni now and met a girl. She is extremely beautiful and kind. Her hair is light brown with long curls with shining green eyes and perfect lips. We met when me and a few other guys were standing awkwardly in a group when our pso had a social with their pso and she came and asked if she could join in on our group. It basically ended up as a two way conversation between me and her. She was so easy to talk to and since that meeting, i couldnt stop thinking about her. Last monday, she moved into my hostel. I was busy eating lunch when she came from behind and greeted me. I was so anxious abd caught of gaurd but happy at the same time. The next morning, i sat and ate breakfast alone and she came in, saw me and sat with me. We talked until they had to close the dining room and then walked to class together. I bacame a different person that week. I woke up at 6 every morning, excited to talk to her again. I took cold showers for absulotely no reason at all and became odly obsessed with jogging. But in friday the anxiety returned. It just took over my brain and i couldnt talk well to her anymore that morning. She talked a lot about her siblings and so on and i just replied with ""oh wow"" or ""ha"". When we walked to class and i greeted her, i accidentally just said ""ok cheers"" when we walked by my class and while she was still talking. Why am i like this. I feel so terrible. She doesnt deserve someone like me. She deserves so much more. I want to express how much i care about her but I just cant keep up with her ambitious and positive lifestyle. Why cant i just act normal. I also made friends who make effort to hang out with me but i dont know how long it will take for me to just push them away. Im so scared of being lonely again."
i98spi," How to cope at my new job?. Okay so I just started a new job at my university, basically as a delivery runner for the restaurants located on campus (to the dorms). Right now, they’re having us promote our service by just walking around campus and asking people to download the app and use our promo code, but this is absolutely terrifying to me. I have pretty bad social anxiety and whenever I stop someone (if I have the guts to do it at all) I start to panic a bit and I stutter, I’m pretty sure it makes everyone uncomfortable. Does anyone have any tips on making approaching strangers less scary and awkward, thanks in advance. "
dgscraw,You'll be fine m8. If you're into baseball you'll have a great time. It's also a good place to practice social skills because everyone is focused on the game.
ri0j3k,The most anxious day I've had since high school and I'm 25. I felt like I was doing good handling my SA but turns out I've been avoiding social situations for so long I've convinced myself I'm doing better than what I actually am. My job had a Christmas event at work. We all stood outside waiting for the food truck to make our order. About 70 people. I was one of the last to arrive in line and I felt like all eyes were on me. I'm masked up 90% of the time at work so I felt like this was a lot of people's first time seeing me without one or they didn't recognize me. I started shaking a bit. Then I sat down next to my manager and coworker on the side walk waiting for our order. About 7 people were standing in front of me not talking to each other so naturally I felt like they were staring at me. I just looked at my phone trying to avoid the contact. At some point when people started to walk away I made conversation with my manager about how she got started. I started visibly shaking. My legs were trembling the entire time. My hands started to shake. I don't think it was awkward because no one noticed but I felt like I was shivering it reminded me of high school. Anyways one thing that has improved is my heart doesn't race anymore. I don't reca my heart pumping fast one time. Usually that's the main symptom people with anxiety struggle with. So it's weird my body just prefers to shake like I'm in freezing cold weather and I just have to hope no one notices. I'm proud of myself for attempting to socialize and get to know my boss better because we never talk on a personal level. Just wish I could feel more confident.
6kx3yx," Do you guys remember what you got social anxiety? Or have you had it all your life? Also, when did you discover you had it?. Obviously if you don't have something then you don't know about it. From the day I can remember up to 5th grade I never had social anxiety. I remember I would even video chat with this girl from my class when I was about 8/9 (about 10 years ago). She would call me omg he computer and I immediately answer with no issues. Around 6th grade I had to move to a different school and I didn't know a single person. Even though the school were only about 3 miles away from each other, the culture was COMPLETELY different. I was around friendly Mexican people (I'm Mexican myself) and The my original school was about 90% Mexican students and teachers. Heck, we were even taught in Spanish from Kinder-2nd grade. But in this other school it was all English, maybe 30% were Mexican and knew Spanish. Here it was about an even distribution of all ethnicities. Also most of the students there also knew each other since kindergarten and I was the knew kid. First the first month or 2 I sat in the dirt by myself during recess. This is where my social anxiety built up. I was so terrified and felt left out at this school. I felt rejected by everyone and I also did gain a bit of weight, I probably went from overweight to obese here. Eventually I did make some friends but I've been used to playing soccer with my friends at my old school (since I'm Mexican) so when I wanted to play soccer with the Mexican kids I realized how much better and fit they were. I didn't want to join them since I knew I was going to embarrassed myself and I just sat on the side watching them play. Near the end of 6th grade I started to look back and realized how much of a ""loser"" I was and hated myself for it. This is when my social anxiety built up to the max. I was so nervous around anyone and every time I got called on I went to immediate panic and started sweating. I remember getting caught once doing my homework during class and my teacher called me out on it. God, i really wanted to disappear since some people started laughing at me. I wanted to get up run away and never show up again. I begged my mother to change me back to the middle school I was suppose to go to. She did but since it's middle school, obviously the people I knew were like maybe 10% of the entire school. I didn't realize that at the time. Well the school gave me a weird ass schedule and I got lost once. I had to go from advisory to 1st period. When I went to first period, I opened the door and the teacher was in the middle of a lecture. I panicked and closed the door. I looked at my schedule and it was that class but I didn't want to go back in. I sat on the floor about 20 feet away from the door and almost started crying. This is when I experienced my worst social anxiety. Luckily I went to class and everything was fine. A few month later I saw this girl from my 5th grade class we said hi and she wanted a hug. Even thought I wanted to hug her I froze and couldn't do it. She got insulted and walked off. About a week later I passed by her and she was holding this guy hand and she said ""look I have a boyfriend now"", I still don't know what she tried to prove or say by doing that. 8th grade was pretty easy since I knew a lot of people by then. Fast forward to going into high school, I knew minimum 1 person in every class during the first 2 years so I was set. In sophomore year about half way into the first semester this girl who sat next to me (assigned seating obviously) asked me for notes or something. I asked her if she wanted me to read them to her since I have shitty writing. The class then got very loud and the teacher was supper annoying and yelled out, ""the next person who talks will get a referral"". My social anxiety kept me talking but very quietly. There were like 2 more lines I had to read and for some reason I said them loud enough for the teacher to hear. She yelled out ""Who was that?!!"" since I didn't speak a lot she couldn't recognize who was talking. She then found out it was me but since I NEVER talked in class she said ""You are too quite in my class so you won't get one"" my face turned as red as a tomato and I immediately got embarrassed. People were cheering me on since I managed to get away without a referral. That's when I realized I had social anxiety, that same teacher helped me get rid of some of it. I don't know if she knew I had social anxiety but she just told me to piss of teachers (only HS teachers) and report back to her every time I do it. So I followed her advice and around senior year I managed to get kicked out of one of my classes for talking to much. She was super happy and exited when I told her that. I don't know how the fuck it happened but I was able to speak to people without too much fear. Today, (I'm 19 btw) I can speak to anyone as long as THEY starts the conversation. It's a little hard if I start it. I usually just ask for help and don't speak to them until they speak to me. Second semester of my senior year I was put into a class were everyone was 2 years younger than me and I didn't know anyone. I managed to make a few friends and have a fun time somehow. I made up bullshit things about myself like I'm Russian and someone believed me about that. He told everyone he knew about that and people started approaching me and wanted to be friends with me. Don't know how I did it but I managed to survive HS and 1 year of CC so far. I still have a lot of social anxiety especially with girls and it's starting to build up again. I'm seeing my friends who would be considered ""weird"" or ""losers"" now looking pretty good and getting their first girl friends. Which has made me self conscious and I'm always judging myself. I'm now starting to loose a lot of weight, I was never extremely over weight but I was a couple pounds away from being obese (BMI). I'm hoping that loosing weight and going to places with my friends will help bring up my self esteem. Sorry for the long story. "
dk822ah," I used to be in the same boat as you. I wish I could say I conquered my fears, but I didn't. I ended up building my own home gym. If you have the space/money you can buy a decent bench, weights, rack, barbell, and dumbbell handles all on Amazon for less than $700. "
cnce3t," I’m 13 male and i need help with my anxiety and embarrassment. Thanks.. Hi, I’m 13 male and i like to play street basketball with friends, play soccer and play basketball on my school team. So anyways i have something that is still bothering me to this day. I was hanging out with my friend after school and his name is Dylan. We were wanting to get a street basketball game going so we called a bunch of guys and planned on playing in a hour. We had 8 guys interested. My brother was also interested and wanted to play so we said he could play. Then my mom said little later. I have a doctors appointment booked for you in 30 minutes and you have to go before you can play with your friends. She suggested that all 4 of us (me, my bro, dylan) drive together to my doctor appointment and then she would drive us to the game. I said ok and quickly ran upstairs to my bedroom and put on my basketball jersey with shorts on. Then said i’m ready to go. So we all drove to the doctors. Once we were there we didn’t have to wait long because it was booked already and the nurse comes to the waiting room and calls my name. I get up and saw my bro and Dylan still sitting. I told them they could come too if they want. My mom said are you sure because your going to get a physical exam done. I didn’t know what that was and thought it meant i was going to be showing how physical fast and strong I am. So i told them yeah i don’t mind them coming in. So we got into the doctors room and we waited for 5 minutes and the doctor comes in. He says hi to me and my mom and notices my friend and brother sitting in the room too. He then asks me are you sure you want your brother or friend in here when we do your physical exam? I said i don’t mind. Still not knowing what that really means. The doctor then said ok can you sit on the bed and take off your jersey? So i did and he checked my heartbeat and measured my waist. Then said ok can you remove your shorts? I was wondering why he was telling me to do this and was a little embarrassed taking my shorts off infront of my brother and friend because both of them never saw me in my underwear before or naked. So i was taking off my shorts and he told me to lay on the bed. So i did and he was pushing my tummy and used this triangle thing on my knee that makes my knee jump. He then told me he needs to check my bowls? So told me to lay on my side facing away from everyone. Then he lowered my underwear and my butt is now showing to everyone and i was so embarrassed! I could hear my bro and Dylan giggling a bit. So then the doctor uncomfortably puts his finger in me and kind of hurt and then it was done and got me to stand up. I felt very embarrassed and noticed my friend holding his phone and smiling. He puts his phone down so i was wondering if he took a picture or video of me when i wasen’t looking? Then the doctor said can you please remove your underwear? I was so nervous and felt anxiety coming in and looked at my bro and dylan who looked really excited. So i took off my underwear and covered myself and then the doctor said put your hands on your sides. I could hear my bro and friend giggling but didn’t want to look at them. The doctor checked everything including my frontal area for about 5 minutes and also told me to turn around. Once everything was done and we left the doctors i felt so embarrassed i didn’t want to talk to anyone. It was nobody’s fault but mine because my mom and doctor warned me and i didn’t know what a physical exam was. I can’t blame them. So my mom dropped us off at the basketball game but i really didn’t want to play anymore cause i had social anxiety and sat off to the side. My bro and Dylan i could see talking with some guys and looked at me. I don’t know if they took a picture of me or video and showed them? What do you think i should do to get over this social anxiety i’m still feeling? and what you think about all this? "
er61p1u," I was a little shy as a child but I generally didn’t think about things too much - I could go to a wedding or funeral and not care at all. I could get up on stage and take part in the Christmas play without feeling overwhelmed. I even had friends that I saw outside of school. For me, everything changed around age 11 or 12 when I started secondary school. This is when I started getting bullied. In the first month, I was pushed down a hill, tripped over, shoved, spat at, had things thrown at me and was generally just belittled in various www aha. It got to the stage where I stopped going to school entirely and wouldn’t leave the house because I was afraid of seeing people from school. Even at 16 or 17 I wouldn’t use public transport on my own, or go to the supermarket by myself. I missed out on that really important period of socialisation during my teenage years and it has undeniably resulted in me being the stunted 24 year old I am today. I’m a lot better than I was, mind you. I can easily use public transport now. I can do shopping on my own. I even find it easier to talk to strangers, or speak up when something hasn’t gone right instead of staying quiet and accepting it. But I still have a long way to go - I recently skipped out on a relative’s birthday meal because I was so nervous to the point of physical sickness.. but it’s a work in progress. "
lo2ym5,"Pregabalin (Lyrica) vs Gabapentin for Social Anxiety. Hey dear people, Im suffering from depression and social anxiety (main source of my depression) since I was 15. Today Im 21 and my whole life was suffering and having negative thoughts beginning when I open up my eyes in the morning. Social Anxiety restricts my life too much in every aspect, friends, hobbys, having a true romantic relationship, going outside or just being myself. So result: big depression, self worth issues and perspectivelessness as well as future anxiety. I tried about 8 meds already (SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOI (Moclobemide), 2 depth psychological therapies and right now I‘m on a tricyclic antidepressant (Amitriptyline 100mg) and in a behavioral therapy. Nothing worked or works. My doc and I already talked about the possibilities of Pregabalin and Gabapentin as all other meds didn‘t work for me and take away a big part and so much time of my life which no one will be able to give me back. What is the better alternative for social anxiety? Gabapentin or Pregabalin. I heard that Pregabalin is a stronger anxiolytic but also more addicting and tolerance-building. What are your suggestions or experiences? Are you on any of those two meds? What effects do they give you and what changes did you recognize in your life, socializing and social anxiety since taking them? Thank you!"
f4wvuet,"revealing to people my insecurities I am doing it mainly on the internet. It helps, tbh I dont think I have sensitive points now. I like when people are offensive to me online and IRL too, because I like to observe how I react and if I am making a progress. I have 15 bans for ""trolling"", because of my weird humor. Trolls dont care about people's opinion and like when people react in any way. virginity, homosexual thoughts I am 23 virgin with sexual sadism and necrophilic fantasies. Doesnt seem like something will change, because I am a loner, rarely communicating with people. I dont have things like empathy, attachment and need for people. Forums are mainly to alleviate my boredom and good way of practicing english, also it makes me less nervous IRL about people. Also did a bunch of ""shame-attacking exercises"" like singing out loud and dancing on the subway I was doing similar things but more retarded, like running with inverted t-shirt and pretending I had parkinson (my anxiety was about people will notice my shaky fingers in general) and singing from time to time (I am the worst fucking singer ever), but people didnt even know what I was singing about, because it was more like humming :D Ive had panick attacks when I was doing those stuff, but I was happy after all."
dz9pz2c,"I know this sounds extremely clichâˆšÂ© but if your friends are saying that, then they're really shitty and aren't really your friends.nnI know exactly what you mean though. I'm fairly close to my mom but that's one area where we differ. She would laugh at me if I make poetry out of the small beauties in life (i.e. I love the way the shadows of trees dance on the grass on a sunny day - so I'd say something poetic about it). Heck, if she only knew I still talk to my stuffed animals and I'm 19...I promise myself I will embrace these things in my future children.nnAnyways, I hope everything works out for you. That sounds like a really neat job to have!"
fgi6xb5," Yes that's basically true. From the age I got a tablet (my parents aren't to blame, she was treating us she thought) I stopped playing outside. I did get some of that outdoor millennial child hood. But it didn't last long enough. We've all been staring at screens for LITERALLY most of our life. We spend more time on our screens that we do asleep or actually living. We are addicted. It is literally the norm. Which is a problem now because those who have life altering mental illness aren't taken seriously because it's a common phrase to say ""depresssd"" or ""I have too much anxiety for that"". Thing is we are all aware of this. But we are all stuck trying to live healthier whilst using the internet as a source to find it out how. Omg wow "

k837od," What are your strategies to get through job hunting and interviews?. Hi. I'm new here and I need some help. I'm a 22 year old who can't even go on a walk. I know I need therapy, I see this myself, but the problem is that I can't ask for help. Online it's somehow different. Maybe it's because I can re-check everything a dozen times? Anyway, I found you people by chance and you seem like a helpful bunch, and I desperately need help now. I've been working freelance for a while now. Tho, something happened and I need to get a real stable job asap. I studied graphic design if that matters? I'm terrified of even writing a resume because I'm scared of making mistakes that could embarrass me. That feeling's always there and won't go away no matter what I do. It's made job hunting a nightmare and I'm fed up with it. Do any of you have any ideas how to fight this stupid anxiety? I'm open to try anything and everything that could help me get that fear of talking to people in check. My main problems are that I overthink everything and that I always feel like everyone is annoyed by my presence. Again, I'm open to whetever you suggest, no matter how crazy it sounds. Thanks in advance! Any bit of help is much appreciated. "

ddtqp0p,"It was near the beginning of university when I didnt know my way around the city that well. I went to a party that one of the clubs im in was having. The party ends and everybody was going home. Now the bus ride is pretty long so I didnt want to be stuck one on one with somebody for the duration. The bus I needed to take another girl was taking so id be stuck in that situation. nnI decided to walk home half way across the city in -30 (I live in Canada). I got completely lost. My phone died, I had no money for a cab and it was late so the buses had stopped running. There wasnt a soul around to ask for directions. I had to guess where I was going for HOURS. Saw the tallest building on campus so far in the distance I could barely see it so I just went towards it. I had to go across this massive field in knee deep snow, then there was a fence on the other side. I climbed over it to find out it was government property. Got out of there and seen an area of trees so I went through it, had to climb another fence. I came to the river which flows through the entire city so i followed along it in PITCH BLACK until I came to a little park that I had recognized. It had pathways that led back to campus but it was at least another hour walk. Climbed another god damn fence and walked along the path in pitch black since the park was closed and no lights were on. I couldnt see a thing, I could only hear the deafening rush of the river to my left and i had to slowly feel my way through. nnIt was a god damn nightmare. I could have taken the bus and it would have taken me directly back to campus. The things we do because of SA is unreal. "
dizjxx7, I was bullied 6 years ago by the 'problem' kid of the school. He had to do a year again and was in class with me.. he brought knives to school and stuff like that. One day his best friend was 'fighting' for fun against another guy and I just supportin the other guy and everything was.normal... then when i went to the toilets and wanted to go back to the playground but then he sneaked up on me and tried to choke me. After that he played all kinds of mental games with me through the year and i was scared as hell i just skipped the last 3 months of school and had to follow therapy.. untill this day i still pray i never see that dude again.. 
qkl9il," Stopped overthinking and just went on a bike ride. Riding my bike brings me peace and joy. It's starting to cool down and I wanted to try riding on a trail I've never seen before. I just moved in August so I wasn't familiar with the area and have been too anxious to go by myself all this time. I googled the trail and read reviews of people saying it could be busy sometimes which made me not want to go. I got all dressed up to go and psyched myself out. I finally stopped thinking and just did it. I biked to the trail and there was barely anyone there. It was absolutely BEAUTIFUL scenery and I'm so happy I did it. Sometimes you have to STOP thinking. As someone that overthinks to prepare for every situation, it can be hard. But my mind gets the best of me sometimes and this time I didn't let it. However at work today I made the mistake of asking my manager about her weekend and she asked me about mine and I told her I road on a trail for the first time and it got super awkward and silent mid convo because I didn't say much of anything to warrant a response back. So I still need to work on my social skills 😂. "
esjw13u, Yup this is why I hate living in an apartment ☹️ You get to meet everyone before you could even start jogging 
g3nb5gd,"1. In general I like groups more, because if they're non judgemental and nice you can have an ok time, and if not, you know you aren't at the center of interaction all the time (except when you are and thats when everything goes to shit). But I cant be vulnerable and emotionally intimate in groups so I prefer one on one with people I actually like. 2. Shy. 3. Alcohol and Nicotine. If not possible I will try to stay in the background and lose myself in thoughts. Sometimes both. 4. I was at a small party where everyone had fun dancing and tried to get me to dance too, which I didn't do. I got so anxious I closed myself completely off and tried to sleep in front of them so I can be alone. After some time I came back to face reality feeling oddly relaxed and laid back but 10 minutes later that Illusion shattered into dust. I had a full mental breakdown and drove home with my bike which has broken brakes, in fullspeed, across a dangerous pathway, only powered by the suicidal thoughts and deep hatred I had for myself. 5. Not really, I just tend to not actually post something when I see lots of flaws which I could be judged for in my post. 6. In february this year, I have been getting into psychology because of my depression and desperate need of assurance about everything and found out about social anxiety and it just explained everything 7. I never was a victim of targeted bullying (because I never fought back in any way and people got bored) but I was often bullied and excluded because of my hair, being ugly, being crippingly bad in sports despite not being overweight and just being shy, poor and quirky. 8. Last year there was a small party with about 9 others and people actually liked me for what I am because I was drunk and wasn't being closed off. I also tried to comfort a girl which had a mental breakdown at the party and after the party a girl offered me to sleep at her house because I couldn't go home. At the next day one of the girls probably tried to hit on me over Instagram but I fucked it up by not asking her back how shes doing. Still, my confidence was at its peak."
f0n7fh0," You are not an imbecile. Instead of thinking that you have a unitary self, think that you have many selves across many different situations. One self is John the socializer. Another is John the student. Another is John the photographer. John the friend. John the traveler. John the chess player. John the tennis player. John the joker. John the helper of others. Thus I= iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii These i's are constantly changing and thus I= iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii (Today) I= iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii (6 Months from now) When you label you as an imbecile you basically say that across all situations of life, you (each i) only act stupidlys and can NEVER act succesfully or do something enjoyable. But this is false. In some situations, some i's do badly. In other situations, some i's do well. What is true that a specific i at the moment, John the socializer, is perfoming badly. What can be done so that a future John the socializer performs better in the future. This is important for you to learn because then you won't see yourself as a shitty person who cannot change, but a person that does badly in a specific area, and can become better in that specific area through practice. This means that you can keep practicing socializing, making mistakes, feeling anxious, without having feelings of being a total shit. Good luck! "
p6ckao," Exercising with SA. I guess this sounds really trivial, but I've been struggling a lot lately to exercise due to my SA. I love taking long walks and would also like to join a gym at some point, but for the past several months I feel like I can barely even leave the house to walk around the neighborhood for fear people will see me. I've been trying to schedule my walks so that there's the least possible chance of encountering people, but it still always seems to happen. It's making this thing I used to enjoy something stressful and something to be dreaded/avoided. I always feel so stupid when I see people during a walk. I avoid eye contact, look down, feel my body tensing up, start walking funny, and feel like I want to die. It's so upsetting to me because walking has always been a thing that helped calm me down and kept me feeling good, but now it's just a miserable experience. Does anyone else here experience intense anxiety when it comes to exercise/walking around the neighborhood? How do you cope? "
mtq86z,"I really think I have social anxiety. (english is not my first language, so pls bear with me lol)  and#x200B; I'm a 18 years old girl and for years now, I've felt extremely uncomfortable whenever I go outside of my house. I feel like I'm choking and cannot breathe when there is people walking at 3 meters or less of me. I'm trying to avoid any eye contacts and I'm always walking super fast. Also, I don't know if it's a thing, but I have developed an habit that whenever I go outside, I absolutely have to have a backpack or a handbag with me and to wear a hoodie or a coat. Even if summer and it's so hot outside, I refuse to get out without something on that will protect myself i guess? I feel more secure with a hoodie on. Also, everything outside is loud and overwhelming. After 15 minutes, I can get an intense migraine because of the sunlight, the temperature, and the sound. Basically, I just feel like the whole world is stepping on me and hurting me when I go outside. I just don't trust people in general and I'm scared of them, even if they just walking and minding their own business. My mom is always telling me that it's not social anxiety because I'm able to go outside, it's not like I'm refusing to get out of the house (I avoid going outside the more possible tho). I get that yeah, i CAN go outside, but the process is difficult and make me really anxious. I just find it really annoying when people are trying to make me doubt about my own feelings and experiences. My mom is the biggest extrovert I know and she's friend with everyone she meets. I just feel bad that I'm her complete opposite..."
q3w77v,"How do I just let my (23M) girlfriend (22F) just have a fun and have friends?. It’s in no way to be malicious; I have a deep urge to try to be friends with my GF’s friends. To some degree, I like to be in big circles, and I want the people to who care about my gf to know that I care about them by being in their circle. It’s intrusive and I know I meet to not. When I DO hang out with her friends, whom I know too through skateboarding, I feel like I don’t fit in. I probably don’t. Which is hard to accept. We all skate but I (very apparently) have other things going on that I’m sure is hard to relate to, thus not starting conversation. I’m at the point where I need to just let those friends be her friends. I can’t keep hurting myself by trying to hang with them and feeling left out. I have a few friends (mostly musicians) of an entirely different group of people whom she doesn’t care to know, which is great! I get to have a bunch of stories to tell and all that. But it’s hard for me to do that with HER. She’s always wanted a social life because we’ve been so attached since we moved away from home. I trust her and she trusts me, but I get nervous when we aren’t together. How can I just let her have fun? She deserves it."
nygi81," How to not think about people passing by when you'are outdoors ?. So, since after the lockdown, I've been feeling anxious whenever someone passes near me, but especially during summer. During summer I have to wear a jacket and pants, and for this reason I think people think I'm weird. A group of guys also passed nearby me and pointed out the fact that I'm wearing a jacket by saying out loud to his friends in a crowded area ""Look, this guy is wearing a jacket"". How can I stop feeling like everyone think I'm weird ? "
87msz9," Anxiety at work?. I started a new job as a server/food runner at a restaurant about two months ago. I think I've gotten better with talking to people. There are days when I get really anxious and there are days when I'm not that anxious. One problem I have is with my boss, he's not rude, well sometimes he can be a little rude when he's under stressed and doesn't know how to handle so he gets all flustered, takes his anger out on his family members that work for him and employees. I get along well with all of my coworkers. But my boss gives me a hard time. I'm not gonna tell him I have SA, imagine how awkward that would be and he would probably ask me why I even work at a restaurant. I'm a very quiet person, I don't speak loud enough and I know this so I've been working on projecting my voice. But I'm also a very slow talker because when I talk fast I butcher up words. He's the type of boss that won't listen to you if you're not loud enough and you don't talk fast. Plus I'm a small person, so I have a very small voice. Sometimes, I feel incompetent at work and wonder why still work there. He tells me he can't hear me and that I'm gonna have to start talking louder in front of everyone. I understand that I need to speak louder but even when I try I can't I have to shout so people can hear me sometimes and it hurts. Sometimes I practice ways to talk louder when I'm showering before I go to work. I know it's weird but I don't want him to yell at me for being too quiet. And sometimes I don't know how to do something and most of the time it's a simple task but I make myself look really dumb, and he gets mad but doesn't yell at me but you can tell from his actions that he's pissed. I've gotten better at standing up for myself but there are days when I feel weak and stupid. Sometimes I feel like I owe them shit. Sometimes it feels like I'm being walked over. Like I want to be heard and raise my voice when needed. My coworker is pretty nice, it's good to have someone who's not a complete bitch and is understanding. But no one at work knows I have SA. I pretend I don't have SA because I know no one will understand. It sucks because alot of times when my coworkers and boss are talking, I just stand there and listen to whatever they have to say. I don't have an opinion of my own. I feel like they would never be able to understand what I go through everyday, I wish I could tell them I'm like this because of my S.A and that there are times when I want to say something but I can't because I get anxious. Sometimes being socially awkward makes me look like I'm really dumb. I start to stutter and slur my words when I get really really nervous. I want people around me know I'm not dumb, I make mistakes because I get really anxious. Sometimes I wonder, why am I afraid of humans, I'm a human too so why am I afraid of other humans? "
rtr3x8,"I (21F) think I may have bulimia. I grew up knowing all the consequences of bulimia, and I thought that I would never have it. However, over the past three years, I think I’ve developed it. When it started, I was getting bullied during my senior year of high school. My depression was at an all time high, and I thought that I wasn’t smart or pretty enough to be anyone’s friend. I didn’t do it often, but sometimes I’d eat a lot and then throw up. A year and a half ago, I met this amazing guy. I liked him, and I thought he liked me, but he had a girlfriend the entire time. I don’t think he’s a bad person, just immature. But he was the first guy to ever like me, and for him to still want to cut off all contact with me showed me that I wasn’t good enough to keep around. I’d starve myself for close to a day, and then eat like there was no tomorrow. I’d go on runs, buy myself a shake from a coffee shop, down it, and then run as fast as I could until I threw up. I started a retail job, and my mom would always make me shakes. I’d buy something unhealthy from the food court and eat it as fast as I could. Then, I’d chug the shake and then throw it up. At family parties, I’d very discreetly go to the restroom and throw up my food. I currently dorm at my university, and I only eat one meal a day: dinner. I have a coffee or two earlier in the day. I know it’s not healthy, but it’s almost a way of life for me now"
fvcsu3a," I know this feeling very well. It’s the feeling of withdrawal after forcing yourself to go out at night. Around January or February before lockdown was initiated, I went to a pub for the first time in seven years. It was crowded as usual and I had to choose an empty seat at the farthest corner of the pub. I ordered a Guinness beer and some tacos. There was music playing with a live band. Although the stuff they were playing weren’t really the sort I listened to, I pretended to enjoy myself despite being alone. The crowd across me was the polar opposite with groups of friends seated together in a long table. They were jovial and some were already dancing to the music. A few minutes later, my order came and a beautiful, young waitress smiled at me. Noticing I was alone, she made small talk which I gladly returned. We talked for a few minutes and seemed to enjoy each other’s company but she couldn’t stay as she had other duties. Half an hour has passed and everyone else was on the dance floor. My food was already consumed and I was on my second pint of Guinness. That’s when it struck me. I wasn’t feeling this place at all. I tried to talk to people but nothing moved past the small talk zone. They were uninterested and, unfortunately, so was I. Someone tapped me on back and I found the same waitress holding out a card machine. That was my cue. I paid and left but not without asking the waitress her name and where she was from: “My name is Albina and I’m from Kazakhstan.” She said, smiling. “You alright? It looks like you’re not having a good time.” I didn’t answer and just smiled back. ***** There I was walking on the beach, alone and confused. I’m pretty sure that Über driver ripped me off but I didn’t care. All I knew was I wanted to be alone. The buttons of my untucked shirt were already undone and my dress shoes spoiled with sand. Hands inside my pockets, I was looking straight at the horizon with the full moon visible. It was a quiet evening and you can barely hear the sound of the city from afar. In a few minutes, I was lost in thought. All I could hear were police, ambulance, or fire truck sirens coming and going. My phone vibrated and I took it out, expecting a notification from Facebook. Nope, only a reminder that I have to pick up the laundry. I realized then that I was more alone than ever in my 28 years of living. ***** I just turned 29 this month and nothing has changed. "
8uqwrg," I (20M) had my first kiss, never thought I'd be here. If you had told me of just 2 months ago that he would be dating a really sweet girl and have his first kiss, there’s no way he would have believed you. At that point I had just turned 20 and had only been on a few dates in my life, had never kissed a girl, and thought I would be alone forever. I felt that through 2 years of college I was missing out on life because of my social anxiety. Then I met this girl the day after one of my worst days of feeling alone. Fast forward to a few days ago, she came to visit me, and we had such a wonderful day. We went roller skating and then later took my dog to the park. That was where we had our first kiss (and my first ever) as we were laying on a blanket enjoying each other’s company. It was honestly one of the happiest moments of my life. As much as I was nervous for it, it went pretty smoothly. And it must have been good enough, because we kissed another 5 or 6 times the rest of the day. I couldn’t get over how good it felt, not just being kissed, but feeling wanted. She is honestly so great because she is really understanding of my anxieties and makes me feel comfortable around her. Unfortunately we wont be able to see each other much when she leaves for school, but I am trying not to think about that much and just enjoy the time I have with her now as much as I can. "
ennl5r0,"Reading all of it made me feel pain in my chest. This situation is so hard and its not easy at all to just ""talk more to your colleagues"" and ""be more social"". Its something that no one should ever experience and those who go through this are nothing less than heroes. Even though Im only 17, I relate to your story in a way. I also isolated myself around 3 years ago, and ever since then I havent had a single friend. I moved to a new high school 2 years ago and tried being more friendly with people, but it never works.I could barely talk for more than a few seconds at a time. Even though ive been going to therapy for almost 3 years now, I feel like I barely made any improvements. I sometimes talk to some people from school, but those conversations almost never last more than two minute because of my stupid anxious ass. For the longest time I blamed myself for how I ended up being so miserable. I always felt that if I would have done things differently, I would have still been in contact with my childhood friends and maybe even made new friends in high school. But let me tell you: *DONT BLAME YOURSELF!* It may not be a useful tip to become more social, but thats the best I could help. Once I finally let this massage get into my head, I felt like Ive become a little less anxious overall. Its useless to think of how you couldve changed things in the past. I try to think about the present, and how people wont really care that much if you do something weird, and even if something happens itll be forgotten by everyone after a few hours. Give yourself defined and clear goals: Im gonna find a job for the summer vacation and try going outside more often. Maybe you wanna chat? I think it would be nice for both of us :)"
en89yu4, Let's go outside for a meal. Oh wait... That means we will have to be served and risk messing up our orders. 
fqwkuqj, I used to be alone in the playground because I liked to and this teacher really forced me to be with other people and I just didn't want to 
etthp1p, No kidding. Something as simple as taking my dog outside I start to think of neighbors eyeing me through their windows.. Such a stupid irrational fear. 
b2arar," Posted here once few days ago, decided to open up myself. I really need to talk.. I’m a male, 20, Canadian. I’m still in my gap year and pursuing a university level engineering degree. I don’t have friends, not even loved ones. I used to be really popular in early high school as I was always happy. I’d never get angry even though my day sucked. I used to play soccer and basketball for the school. Teammates are really supportive and friendly. I enjoyed my time being in the team. Also I loved volunteering and helping people in need such as charity walk, donating blood, food bank,etc.. I also served as a Scout for a really long time. People really liked me and I liked people. But when I was 17, I moved to a big city and continued to complete my high school diploma. That’s where the nightmare began. I got in a school that nobody really liked me. Even though I’d been initiating conversation and I just felt like they were avoiding me. It’s completely different to compare with the previous school. Classmates stared at me when I completed a presentation, while they applauded for the others. Nobody willing to talk to me even though we got similar interests. Some kept gossiping about me (And the sad thing is they seemed nice to me). Teachers and the school didn’t really offer much help even though I seek for help. I started to hate going to school and making friends. People aren’t as beautiful as you thought. I feel like I can’t really fully trust anyone anymore. I can’t tell anyone about this because I don’t want anyone to know how broken I am. I literally cried everyday when I got back to home because I don’t want to show people that I’m weak. But the fact is, I’m weak. But fortunately I quit my school few months ago. I got a tutor that can offer me official credits and it’s like a 1 on 1 tuition. I’m working towards to become an engineer. I still don’t have friends but actually it can be a good thing - no gossip and I don’t have see much people so I’ll just pretend people aren’t avoiding me. So that I can focus on my academic and get into a university. I heard that university is way better than high school - better environment, perhaps better people. But to be honest I can’t really trust people anymore. I’m always afraid of meeting new people. At this period of time I still cry sometimes when I feel lonely (it can’t be held, but it usually occurs at home because I just can’t forget how broken I was, wish I can forget everything happened in the school). But secretly, in washroom or bedroom. And I’ll feel way better after crying a bit. Keep working and working so that I can get into university. Sometimes I really feel like I’m mentally sick. But I DON’T want to be treated as a patient, or a problem. I just want to be treated as a normal individual. I want to have companies. Being loved by somebody is so warming. I’m sorry I typed so many. I know this is like some sort of shitpost because some people would think that I haven’t been working hard enough and looking for excuse. Well I’m so sorry about that and I’m working so hard in order to become an engineer recently, I can assure you that I WILL get an engineering degree eventually. But I just want to talk and I feel better after typing this because I’m quite upset in these 2 years. Downvotes are expected. At least I feel better. "
f060jee, I’ve got a year to go (in the process of applying) and I am really terrified of dorms. I went to a summer camp at a college where we stayed in dorms and I low key cried myself to sleep every night except the one where my roommate was out later and I had a half hour to read in peace. I didn’t shower all week because I was to anxious to do so. Actual college will be an interesting experience to say the least... 
g0mik4x,Craigslist. I got my first job at 20 as a dog walker (which is honestly my dream job as a socially anxious introvert) but I was lucky enough to land it due to living near a big city. I’m 22 now and that was still the only job I’ve had thus far. Recently got furloughed tho so idk where my life is headed next.
f8kkri8,"Over 4 years ago I think. I was at a summer camp where I briefly felt like I belong, but I didn't really make any friends there and life became dull again"
fbg8v28,"I hated PE more than anything, we were required to dress in a PE uniform and I never brought mine as I didn't wanna participate, yet I still passed somehow (probably because I went to a shitty highschool). More than I hated PE, I hated swimming lessons, so I never brought my swimwear. I remember being in a detention class for people who didn't go swimming and there was like 20 of us. I wish I had some advice to offer you, but your post just reminded me of how much I hated highschool and how amazed I am that I still passed despite not following the ""rules""."
cyxibyl,"Yes, unfortunately. It's like I just wont accept this one friend I've hung out with since we were in kindergarten has finally changed too much. We just barely have anything in common anymore and I just keep thinking I wanna keep in contact. I used to think we really needed each other or something, but the truth, I think is, whenever I'm gone (moved out or otherwise) he manages fine on his own and doesn't really care if he has me around or not, but if I'm around he'll hang out for sure. It just bums me out a bit, because I always thought we had a special kind of friendship and I don't want it to turn into dust just because there's no attachment from the other side. I should probably get some normal friends and a girlfriend instead, because my mom always joked it's like we're in a relationship me and him because of the way we hang out. No homo. Yay, so nice that I have anxiety then because I can almost never make myself get outside and when I do I'm so exhausted I need 3 days to recharge before I dare to venture outside again."
g3nlbso,I live a 5min walk away from the ocean but haven’t been down to the beach in over a year because I’m scared of seeing people I know or people from my school. Social anxiety really does control every part of my life
qfci80," Why so many posts on here asking ""How to get friends"" or ""I want friends""? I guess I don't understand because I have an independent attitude.. # 14 year old boy here. (not that that matters, I just type that so you get to know me better lol) Anyways, I've always had an independent attitude. maybe its from my bullying experiences in school or walking through the hallways knowing absolutely nobody surrounded in this sea of kids. I've grew kind of a low key hatred, or distaste for other people. "
fvi1gpa,"I don't do it all the time because I feel like feet are natural but if it's a close up of my feet then yeah lol. Other people though it'll be like a landscape of multiple people and it's cut off from the ankles down and I just don't get it. I will say though it's mostly men who do this over women. I see a lot of beach pictures of men in the ocean or on the beach and it's a normalnphoto but you can tell their feet are cropped out and I'm like, why?"
pv15om," Having FOMO with social anxiety = constant dilemmas of whether to go to an event or make an excuse. So tomorrow theres this big beach event/party for my uni which involves activities like surfing, kayaking, and volleyball which is super intimidating to me tbh (but super cool to most ppl). Theres gonna be like a 1000 ppl there. But my suitemates are going and i have FOMO and have the urge to wanna tag alone bc im afraid of being left out or some dumb shit like that. Also i have a singing performance in a group for which i need to go at 4pm. The beach thingy ends at 1pm. Idk if it’s worth going to the beach party, esp because I’m worried I won’t have fun plus I’m already kinda worried abt my performance that same day. But having to say “i cant go” last minute makes me feel bad and worried of being judged and disliked. I cannot make decisions for the life of me lol. "
bud1io, I actually went to the gym!. I posted previously about my attempts to go to the gym. Many of you suggested I go with a friend so I convinced one to join up with me. Today we went together for the first time and it was so much better. We took turns using different equipment while the one of us stood by trying to watch the other's form. I kept thinking people were looking at us. At one point I saw a personal trainer and his client laughing at us because we were bench pressing without weights and it looked like we were spotting each other but we were just trying to do it right. I wanted to leave but maybe I was imagining it. They were looking right at us. At one point I told my friend I wanted to stop but he urged me to go on so I did and completed my routine for the first time. I found that if I just stopped looking at everyone around me - facing the walls and away from mirrors - I coped better. Couldn't bring myself to use the showers though - that's a hurdle for another day. I feel both good and bad about it. I keep picturing those guys laughing at us but I know how to deal with ruminations like that now and am doing my best. Much love to this sub for the advice and support. I'm going again on Friday. 
do62a3v,"Yup, same here. Jogging isn't my thing at all so I'd like to hit the gym but *the people*. :(nnDo you have the money to buy a (used) cross trainer or how they're called? Or maybe it helps to go jogging with someone close first so you're not alone at least? Doing frightening things with my SO at first helps me a lot. And it's a step in the right direction. Doing fitness at home is a good circumvention but it's not helpful for your SA. :|"
f6xealo,"I was exactly the same. I’m 25 now, and I can’t say I’ve lived expecting the best years of my life... but just live man. Live day by day, try to enjoy the little things. Get yourself out there around ppl. Whether it be school or a part time job. Look into learning new things or visiting new places. You don’t need to go to the beach or on a hike with ppl. Look into some meditation/art classes. There’s plenty of free stuff you can find online. All in all... best piece of advice. Learn to love being on your own. Don’t expect happiness to come from others because that’s how people constantly get let down. Start learning to love yourself and cherish who you are. I’ve never been more confident in my life than I am now at 25. I think a big aspect of it is that I don’t care anymore lol. I don’t care what other people think and I don’t feel like I need to be doing what other people are doing."
cw3u5tr,"I obsess over how much of my adolescence as a whole I missed. To be honest I don't even have a lot of memories besides playing by myself in my backyard. I was overweight, had a lazy eye, and terrible hygiene until I was about 14 when my teacher sent me home cause I smelled so bad. I had a handful of temporary friends who I never built lifelong relationships with. I completely shut myself out from everyone. Once I turned 16 I dropped out and got my GED then did nothing but sleep and play games for about 3 years. Eventually I lost 80 pounds, got a job and even a girlfriend. The thing is. I'm still awkward and anxious about everything. I look at everything like I did back when I was laying in bed and had to go to school the next day. I'm gonna look stupid, people are gonna be in their group making fun of me or think I'm a freak, I'm gonna be alone cause I don't reach out to people and give off this impression that I don't wanna talk to them but they probably don't really wanna talk to me so why bother? Nobody likes me so I won't bother anyone. I never developed social skills and it's so discouraging cause to everyone else talking to people is nothing."
td75ad,"Life recovery journal, pt1. DISCLAIMER: I really doubt if it's worth posting here. please let me know if I should look up for another place to post my ""memoirs"" and feel free to skip this tldr post 😅 the point is simple: sharing my plans with publicity will increase the chance of following them 1. a few words about myself: 21m, recently I have been working in the IT. never had a girlfriend. addicted to video games, smoking, porn. rarely go outside, and also work from home. I have two friends and both from school, for a long time I did not make new acquaintances. my job and communication with people cause me great anxiety. I am always inside my mind, always in a bad mood and dissatisfied with myself. 2. the topic before the start of the war (I am from Ukraine), things were slowly and gradually getting better, but after that it got even worse than it was. so I decided to take action. here and now, even under shelling, I don’t want to give up, I even have increased thirst for life now. I'm going to take small steps, improving just one little thing at a time. I have already been able to successfully use the principles of the kaizen philosophy and I am going to use them again. 3. the action to begin with, I will put my body and brain in order. porn, cigarettes, irregular sleep, sedentary lifestyle fucked up my brain and body and I want to deal with this first. I'm going to track progress in a daily habit format. so at first it would be a good idea to start going out and moving around a little, so the first habit would be to walk at least 2000 steps every day. right now I'm finishing this post and going for a walk. at first glance, this habit may seem stupid and ridiculously easy, but it has several functions: to start at least some beginning of my recovery, to accustom the brain to perform the same action regularly, which will benefit my discipline and bring at least some order in my life. when regular walks become habitual for me and I can follow this habit without any volitional effort, I will begin to develop the following obviously, there is a lot of shit in my life and a regular walk will not fix it. but I want to focus on the good and also would like to believe.. if u're still reading and didn't get super bored, let me know it's okay to post stuff like this time after time. I very appreciate any positive or negative feedback"
i1my4fh," That's one of the main problems of SA. We seek approval and validation so much, we change personality to fit with the person/group of people we're currently with. You have to figure out who you want to be, what your standards are and what you're interested and passionate about. That's a hard process for people who have or have had SA. Because you can't turn to other people to tell you, you have to search deep within yourself. For me, I figured out I love to find how things work, meditate, go on long walks and watch some docus. When you figure that our, you have to be proud of it and do them and tell people about them. That's the part I'm trying to do now. A warning: I know that confident extroverted persona. I've played it and it's worked, in the short term. Maybe that's who you are, most probably it's not. I felt good and thought I was making progress because people were liking me and I was finally confident. But that's not who I am. It felt exhausting and disingenuous. After some time, it became even worse than my previous SA situation, because now I had to constantly put up an act. I don't know about medication, I've never taken any. But what I know and one piece of advice you have to take away: You have to make yourself happy. Not your mother, your family, your friends, boyfriend or anybody else. You have been denying yourself your own happiness your whole life because of SA. Try to find it. Love yourself. Do things that you like. If you don't know what you like, experiment and find those things. Life is too short to be wasting it on stuff that you don't want. It's YOUR life. It took me quite a while to get that. I listen to advice from other people, but in the end it's my choice what to do. And trust me, there isn't a better feeling in this world from doing what you think is right, saying what you want, even if you make mistakes or get rejected. Because I'm finally me and being rejected for myself is far better than being accepted for a fake persona I put up. Anyway, I think this has gotten way too longer than I expected it to be. I wish you all the luck and strength in your journey. Take care. "
pmew7y," My feet are bound by shackles, i wont be held captive by the lonliness i fear. Im stuck between reality and the ideal world beyond (where im an extroverted beast) , if i continue to run away (from social situations) chains will grip around my feet and they will quickly surround me. My heart's longing too strong to give in (to be one day a very confident man), so ill never give up and my heart will continue to carry on. Slowly i close my eyes and then the sea of concsiousness arises( the missed oppurtunities of my life). Im captured by this lonliness you think i donot know? See above all im just a person who deserves more (not to have SA) "
ftg70ah," Advice from a bigger dude. Don't run. I feel like it wears on our joints worse and from another person with SA, I always feel like a run like a dope. If you can find a comfortable place to swim laps Id highly recommend. No wearing on the joints and insanely effective after the leaning curve. and it's refreshing "
5w09nc," I hope this will help. Hi everyone, I'm a 22yo male shy and introvert since the day I was born and this week I decided that I had enough of this. (I won't give you a back story of my life, too long) After 2 weeks of feeling like shit, hopeless and lonely, something happened inside me. I was on youtube and i watched 2 videos that inspired and triggered me at the the same time and I suggest you to watch (the second one is almost 1hr long but worth it, the first is simply amazing): In the past few days I tried to come out of my shell and so far I feel awesome, here some advice: - when you think that ""your mind goes blank"" is just your brain filtering stuff. I'm sure that when you see someone you think about something to say even if it is superficial, but then you approach him/her or vice versa and everything is gone. Well from now on try to think about the thing you want to say as if you're jumping off a trampoline into a huge pool, it looks scary but is the safest thing ever.(of course this does not mean have no filters at all) - experiment the previous advice by talking to people that either you know already but you're not confident around or total strangers. - when you have a social interaction of any kind DO NOT think about it after, not 10 minutes later, not before you go to sleep (you'll come up with things that you think looked or sounded awkward) unless you need to do so for a specific reason. - don't stare at the ground when you walk, keep your head high - smile and look happy when you're around people I hope this will help you, as I said I'm doing great so far (even though today I still chickened out when I wanted to talk to my crush) but I feel that slowly I'll get better! (sorry for the english but it's not my first language) "
g3trbz2," Everybody around me is excited to be finally having a job and money and independence and I'm scared of all of that. I have no idea how they're not afraid of any of that. Like, dude, I can't even go ride a bike without a panic attack. "
d2av49m," Coincidentally, i just went walking on a trail with my mom and saw this little boy on a bike. And my mom went ""hiiiii"" in this creepy voice that she usually uses for dogs. The boy just kept riding his bike and wouldn't look at us. I told my mom not to do that (probably made the kid nervous), and she said, ""well he looked at me!"" Me: ""i look at people too, i don't want them to say hi to me."" So yeah... i usually stay away it in places I'm not that comfortable or familiar with. But i used to say hi or smile to strangers at my college where i am a lot comfortable at. "
fqpk3vd," The first time is always difficult. It gets easier as you expose yourself to more situations. Going to a florist with your mom though is a perfect first step. A couple of months ago I decided to take the semester off to focus on myself. I ended up going to therapy and I set a goal for myself that I would go to the movie theaters by myself once a week. It was very good exposure therapy for me since I didn’t feel obligated to go and it’s also place where you don’t have to talk to anybody but it’s still nerve wracking to walk in there and sit down. It was hard for me at first but once I pushed through it became one of my favorite past times. So I would try and find something like that you could do, maybe a walk in the park or even just keep going to the store with your mom will help a lot as you do it more "
dexh3gj," People who feel the need to insult others with no reason or provocation do so because they want to break someone else down to feel better about themselves. He may have made a comment about your height but it really speaks volumes about his own insecurities. I work with a person who is 5ft 3, a whole foot and an inch shorter than me, and I honestly don't even notice it until she says something. While I'm sure it feels like people aren't taking you seriously, or like it sets you back, to other people your height is not something they will really think about. How big or small you are doesn't really play a part in your relationship with others unless there's a physical component anyway, and in most cases being smaller as a female is actually in your favour. Especially when boys make comments please try remember that they were once learning how to tell a girl they were interested by pushing her over in the playground. A lot of people lack tact, and they may just be trying to get your attention by being mean because they want your attention on them. "
azzr0w," When Will Loneliness Be Considered As ""Normal"" By the Society?. Hi everyone, I initially asked this question on r/loneliness but I also wanted to ask here as well &amp;#x200B; Unlike most of you I actually like loneliness. Sure I'd love to meet with a small group of close friends occasionally but not always and I'm fine with being alone. But still, I have the social anxiety. &amp;#x200B; I've lived abroad as an international student for a year and I was mostly alone which I enjoyed overall. This also includes most of the outdoor activities such as going to shopping, watching a movie, eating out, travelling etc. However, I seriously think that the society is not ready that people can go out alone. By the society I mean one of the most liberal and open-minded countries in the world (at least I think) so I dare to generalize. &amp;#x200B; First, most of the event in the town has been organised for families. I think this is fair enough but I just wanted to mention it anyway. &amp;#x200B; Second, some weird looks by the people. I should first note that I don't think those looks were weird because I'm a foreigner but because I am alone. Whenever I go to a bar or a restaurant or even to a cinema I had some weird looks that lasts few seconds because I'm alone. Initially, this was irritating but I'm now used to it. &amp;#x200B; Third, weird questions by the people. When I was travelling around the country I met a few people and after a while the topic eventually comes to questions of ""why are you travelling alone?"" or ""don't you have any friends to travel with you"". Well, I couldn't answer that because I want to go wherever I want rather than mutually agreeing on everything. While travelling alone may sound extreme(?) to some, I've had similar questions because of going to the cinema alone or even shopping. I've seriously heard the question that ""why are you going shopping alone?"". &amp;#x200B; All these questions, obviously, make my anxiety worse by making me think about myself as weirdo or a freak , if nothing. &amp;#x200B; So my question is, when will doing some activities alone be considered as ""normal"" rather than attracting negative thoughts on people's mind? &amp;#x200B; Thanks "
lqiizt,"No contact (physical) for abt 2 months with friends and im going out with one tomorrow 😥. Since the confinement that started in early january, i haven't had any contact with friends ( my circle is small now too ), no phone calls, etc, and tomorrow we decided to see each other, to take a walk, but im so nervous, i feel more troubled about it than happy... is this weird? Im afraid ill not be able to talk or make conversation in those silence moments. Any advices? Thank u"
dytiidk,"That's a bit too much it would make me depressed haha. I want something in a small town with a garden that has vegetation so dense you can almost not see through it. And live there with a nice woman and a few cats. Have good friends come over, but not everyday. Oh man one can dream :)."
g6ftd19,"if it makes you feel better somehow , am 19 nearly 20 i live whit my parent's i don't have a job i can barely go outside , i get anxiety from my own family now ."
fprpo9k, I recently could start going outside for an hour every day and I can tell it gets worse. I can't even look at people at their eyes 
g7yxoig,"Maybe I'll give you some insight from someone who fits this label. I have social anxiety but I'm also an extrovert. I need social interaction to function and I like people. But, I can't order in restaurants without shaking, I can't give presentations without nearly crying, when I moved to university I had a breakdown before I did any activities where I'd have to meet new people. I dread going to the grocery store, when I'm jogging on the forest trails near my house and I hear people coming my way I turn around because it scares me to have to interact with them. I can't fill out forms without overthinking: it's taken me two months to apply to a grocery store job because the thought of being new at a job and interacting with a group of people who already know each other makes me want to vomit out of stress. Among many other examples, I think it's safe to say that I face anxiety-based adversities and I do so almost every day. nnThat being said, I also want to have friends and do activities. Sometimes I feel strong and I compliment a stranger on their outfit, I'll be anxious the whole time but I still do it. I make myself meet people and initiate conversations, I try my best to be as strong as possible so I can live the life I really want. My extroverted side comes out, I seem very bubbly and excited even though I'm having heart palpitations and my stomach is in knots. A lot of people are surprised that I have social anxiety because I seem like I'm really able to put myself out there. nnIt's like you're gatekeeping social anxiety, there are more to people than what meets the eye, and you seem to not understand how people can struggle when they aren't meeting your ""criteria"" for anxiety. nnPeople can be shy and not shake, cry, choke, sweat, etc. They are valid in their struggles even if they aren't as extreme. Having anxiety and some shyness is human, and it doesn't need to heavily impact their lives to be real. Just because you get these extreme symptoms doesn't mean you can discredit other people. I'm sorry that you think others can never fully understand, but you really have no way of knowing what others are going through. I think it's also really weird that people HATE others for experiencing these feelings. So what, they're wrong about being shy? People interpret their own feelings differently so what's shy to them might not be to you. nnSorry if this seemed like a rant, I just think this can be a really damaging and narrow-minded way of thinking. I agree to an extent that when people exaggerate things or self diagnose, it's irritating and can be demeaning for the rest of us. I think rather than come out with ""I lowkey hate..."" it would be better to try and educate others and start a discourse. At the end of the day who are we to discredit others based on their personal interpretations of their own feelings."
nggb20,"How do you manage your SA when you feel like you’re regressing?. I go through periods where my social anxiety feels like it’s starting to get better, where I wanna be around people, stay with my boyfriend and HAVE to be social but then I go through periods where I return back home, stay alone in my room, don’t go anywhere at all and become a recluse. When this happens, my anxiety spikes about the most irrational things like fear of going outside in case my neighbor comes out or people are walking around and see me. Or I’ll be in a small social circle and shut down just due to how anxious and uncomfortable I feel from my social anxiety. I was previously on Cymbalta and it worked so well for my SA but had crazy side effects that I just couldn’t deal with, 1 being that I was just constantly fatigued. I switched to 20mg of Prozac a month ago and honestly don’t feel like it’s done anything for me. Whereas I felt the Cymbalta work almost instantly. My dr. Said my dose couldn’t be increased until I’m on this dose for 4 weeks and just ugh. I don’t feel like myself. I don’t feel comfortable talking to people like I used to and I just constantly feel on edge. Tl;dr: I hate this feeling of not having a control on my anxiety. It’s ruling my life. How do you guys deal with your SA when it starts regressing?"
fhshiqd,"I was in a similar spot about 2 years ago, around the same age. It wasn't until I started to realize that I spent all my time at home and never left the house did I realize I was missing out on a lot. I talked to my parents about my Depression, and after a bittersweet conversation, we went to see a therapist. Took some time to set things up, and do a blood test. I got a chance to talk to someone later, who mentioned my blood shows i was really lacking in vitamin D and other stuff. We talk more, and it feels nice to get stuff out in the open. I get some basic meds, and start to notice slight changes after a month or two. Social situations have less of a razor's edge, and is easier to jump into conversations now. I feel less energy-dead. I try actually taking a walk outside. I don't go far, and i have to keep headphones on, and I'm super conscious about the music I'm listening to, and i feel awkward and like a big doof, but... I do it. And I just... Go for walks, every now and then. More months go by. I start walking to the store for groceries (and for myself). Traffic still puts me on edge. It's been easier to smile, easier to laugh, and it's actually starting to feel genuine again. Smiling and thanking cashiers feels nice. Sun on my face, time to reflect, and buying things on my own, for myself, and for my family. It feels nice. Slowly getting better. Slowly realizing its kinda fun to talk to people and see what makes them tick - see what makes them react. This is with monthly check-ins with the therapist and sharing how I'm doing, and plans to improve. I usually leave with a big smile on my face cus it feels.... Like hope, again. So when i say you should seek out therapy, i dont mean because there's something ""wrong"" with you. But because i really think it can help, and it makes a huge difference. It will take time, but it... Feels like a different world, to not have to be terrified of social stuff anymore. Well, some stuff is still scary, but much less so."
3sqrtr," I got the courage to join a Basketball team... Hi! Before I tell my story, I'd like to say that my biggest problem with my social anxiety is having interesting conversations. I'm a 16 year old male. So, around June of this year I started taking an interest in Basketball. I managed to tell my parents to get me a hoop and a ball so I could play in my free time. I play often! I really do love the sport, and when I heard about the Rec league basketball sign ups, I couldn't resist. I was excited to play for a team, but I was nervous I would be outdone by people who are far better than I am. Fast forward to tonight, the teams first practice. I showed up expecting to be really social and I even prepped myself while driving there to be social and meet my new team. Well, the practice wasn't bad, but I don't think I said a single word the entire time. I want to be comfortable around my team, but I just can't. Not to mention I'm easily the least skilled player on the team (I'm not horrible or anything). How can I reach out and meet my team and get comfortable around them? TL;DR: Joined a basketball team, too nervous to talk to any of my team members and want to get comfortable around them so I can play my best. "
jpai7n," Unsure of whether I still have anxiety or not (Experiences I have gone through). So, I'm almost 19 and I last attended school, in person, in March. That was my senior year of Highschool and I was so relieved that I didn't have to go back. In school, I was extremely quiet, my throat always felt clogged, I would sweat, I would randomly turn bright red, and worse of all, my upper body, such as my neck and shoulders, would twitch and shake randomly (in some classes, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't stop it? sometimes it would be soo violent and I would dread anyone seeing it). Eating with a spoon in lunch was also difficult, my hands just couldn't do it. I feared being seen alone too, however, I did have friends to sit with... Thankfully, everyone knew me as the tall, quiet, nice guy who never spoke that much. Everyone kind of respected that I guess? Head nodding and occasionally talking to some people is how I didn't fully collapse in school. It made school easier to go through and having a jacket on also kept me from shaking too much. Only class that I felt somewhat at ease for, presenting wise, was German. Everyone there was nice and I loved to make my presentations pretty funny. Anyway, I have work in the summers. Basically, it's my two older siblings and me. I was outside, probably talking to hundreds of people a day (just scanning things), and I felt okay. Just saying hello and have a nice day. I guess my sun glasses helped? I felt safe and I had no anxiety (plus my eyes are way too sensitive to the sun). It felt good making peoples' days... I started working when I was 16. Occasionally I have had rude and mean people, but my sunglasses reflected those blows (plus I understood why they could be upset and felt bad for them). Things were different inside the office and I felt jumpy/uncomfortable. I never took medication... I'm not sure why, maybe it's because I'm afraid I'll become dependent on it? (my siblings had to take some). Or that there are way too many medications out there and it's just an overload of information I'll have to research? Now, I'm in college, online, and I tend to have my camera turned off. I only have to speak every now and then; with my heart going crazy when I do, but at least I don't have other people looking at me. Hmm, when showing my face, I only show my eyes. For some reason, I tend to feel like my anxiety makes me give off bad vibes sometimes? Like, my facial expressions seem off/mad/upset (another fear, being seen as mean and bad...). Bitting my lip has helped and it became a habit. Performing in sports... I quit everything I ever done because of being the center of attention. I had an opportunity to do more meets in track... and what did I do? I didn't sign up for spring track. I have to avoid attention, yet, sometimes I really want to talk infront of people and be that center of attention. Once, during my last few classes in highschool, I had to read and was pop-corned on. I felt confident but my voice failed me... It was one of my worse outbreaks that year... I didn't shake, but my voice was so broken and shakey. My eyes kind of failed me as well, tearing up. In my head I was like ""stop, please!"" Begging my body to listen. I finished... and no one every pop-corned on me again (that was probably the worse part). Going back to freshman year... It's when things spiked out of control and I had to coup without medicine. I was always quiet, after getting framed and in trouble all the time in 1st grade; I was known as the most quietest person in the school after that. 8th grade is when my anxiety started to creep in, and I don't know why. Different environment and teachers? Lack of friends... Or growing up. My future... My memory capabilities aren't good (even one of those DNA reports mentioned it on prometheus) and I doubt my intelligence. I struggle in math, when I thought I was good at it, and I'm terrible at science. I can't grasp the concepts well enough and so I just remember how to do problems for the test. History bores me as well, but I like reading fictional history in books. I want a meaningful job that changes the world in a positive way, and have it pay well. However, I can't seem to find my passions and there's too many options out there. I can't pick anything and fear that I may become a failure? I'm good at running, competitive video gaming, and maybe writing... I'm well-rounded... However, I can't stream games because of my anxiety and Idk if writing pays well/if I have the patience. I don't know why I am questioning whether I have anxiety or not (maybe I had no idea what to put as the title or something). I most definitely do, but I really want to say that I don't. The thing is, I can feel confident, it's easier said than done, and once I'm out there, I crash. My thoughts can be poison. I'm nevious about going back to school and have people see me 24/7. The coronavirus kind of saved me... In a way. I didn't have to go to school and towards the end of my senior year... I was actually getting pretty depressed and my smiles became fake. I skipped the graduation walk and pinned it on COVID. I do need a job to pay for my second year of community college too (I just won't have my protective sunglasses then). I just wanted to get this out there... It does feel better typing it out and collecting my confused thoughts. "
d0wkfui, On days when I'm tired I find myself getting lost in my mind on my bicycle from school and start talking quietly to myself or even making voices from something I'm picturing in my head. Every time a car drives by I cringe at the thought that I am probably visibly talking to myself. It's very annoying that I can't quite control it but it's only on the days when I'm sleep-deprived it happens because it makes me all airheaded. 
e935dx2,"I am fascinated by people who are free and can do whatever they want without giving a shit. That and nature/vegetation because they relax me. nBy the way, i finished school this year and days go on without meaning. I love food too but i am too lazy to learn cooking. I love to try different restaurants. I guess living in Italy does affect me in that sense. nI am trying to develop hobbies in order to fill empty days. For example I am reading some mangas lately. "
aol9vk," Will I ever again be as outspoken and confident as when I was a child?. When I was a child in elementary school I was very vocal, extroverted and expressive. I could talk like a waterfall and always found the right words effortlessly. In school I would fluently speak to the entire class and the words just came naturally to me. Then in prep school when I was 10 the vicious bullying started, which I was not equipped to endure as I was a very sensitive child that wanted to be liked by everyone. It continued for years and took a huge toll on my mental health and personality, deteriorating over the years into a depression and social anxiety. Instead of comfortably speaking I now could only utter short, simple sentences, stuttering while trying to remember the words I had laid out in my head. My body tensed up and my mind was in panic mode whenever I was around people. Many years later at 18 and in university I started depression and anxiety medication causing me huge relief, plus I was forced to constantly challenge myself in my personal life so I could keep up with my social circle. I'm now much better at 23 but I'm nowhere near as outspoken as I was as a child, because I'm restricted to non-complicated sentences and I still struggle to hold a conversation fluently and naturally. Often times I simply don't know what to say in social situations because I never learned that going through puberty. How tf do you make small talk with strangers or acquaintances?? My mind just goes blank and I stand there like an idiot. Am I ever going to regain the effortless, communicative skills I had before the traumatic experiences? "
pvesbi, I feel so bad when i can’t go to events when I genuinely feel sick. So today i was going to hike with new friends but i felt too hot and i get migraines in the sun so i didn’t continue. My friends are having a follow up thing at someone’s house but i just don’t feel good physically. I’m thinking of not going but i feel embarrassed. I didn’t make a scene but i feel bad enough for not being able to do things. I try to prioritize myself but at the expense of feeling bad 
f81qbr6," Yea I definitely made some changes. I started at least trying to get out of my comfort zone and, for example, talking to the people at school. I found out they didn't hate me or thought that I'm annoying or weird, as I thought they do. At least most of them. I learned that they thought I'm arrogant and think of them as annoying (they didn't say it directly, I just figured it out). It were very simple dialogues, like, what was the homework, I don't like this teacher, I hate summer etc, then it evolved into deeper conversations with some of them. Since I did that, people started inviting me to go somewhere with them and I almost always accepted, even if my anxiety was telling me no. I also started getting my BED under control, I stopped restricting which foods I can and cannot eat (unless they were my trigger foods, like white bread). I kept track of my triggers, which were mostly emotional, and started avoiding them. Also, I tracked how many times a month I binged and how many days I went without binging. I still tracked my calories, just not with an app but in my head. I began to do all the things I wanted to do after I stop binging, like buying nice clothes or going on a walk. Throughout all of the 3 years I've battled with it, I didn't stop exercising, which I can only recommend. It helps you feel like you achieved something, also, I found a few hobbies, which gave me topics to talk about. Everyday I set a small goal to accomplish, like, read 5 pages of a book or something. I took very small steps and still have a way to go, but actually doing something to get better is the best thing you can do. "
ne6a8r,"A long rant about being scared of getting my license soon, distracting myself w/ exercise, and wanting to die. Im getting my license very soon. In like two days...I’m 19. The only thing i can think of using my license for is to get all the tattoos i want (but i feel like it’s a terrifying place to go to alone) and buying foods. But I really don’t feel ready to be outside by myself. I can do errands. It’s somewhat easy to do that now. Idk. I just feel comfortable with my mom. I absolutely won’t go to the mall though...Anyways, i’m wondering if being a person who grows up having friends and spending time without ppl make it’s easier to be independent. As my social anxiety and depression got worse I wanted to get away from my mom cus i thought she was making it worse. But then once i graduated we got closer and it’s much different then before. I wanted to move away so bad, but now i’m getting my license finally and i feel like crying thinking about going outside to places on my own. I guess it’s that I only have my mom...I just don’t know how to interact with people. I only say what I absolutely need to say, nothing more. I don’t ask how is your day or anything. I can’t. Also before I didn’t know, but now i feel like my mom is really precious. Also i can’t tell if i need a therapist or not. I’m too scared to get one because I really don’t think they can help me. What would i say to them and what would they say to me? I have no idea. Recently i’ve been obsessed with fitness and health. I spend my whole day thinking about it, and when i actually started exercising more consistently, i did it because i felt like i was going to explode. So all i’ve been doing is distracting myself. For the first time in maybe a week i’m thinking again. And i’m feeling again like i don’t know what my future is gonna look like. When i think of myself talking to people, participating in the world, having friends, working, it seems like another person. I just can’t do it. Ive been acting like exercising is me getting it together, but it’s only a small thing. And it’s still in my house. But I cannot do anything outside of this house...Maybe I should continue living in the present and just be happy that i’ve started exercising. Because it IS progress. But I just can’t help but feel nervous realizing that i still cannot see myself functioning in the outside world...When will I? I wish I could just stay in my house I really do. I don’t know how it is that suddenly I want to die. And i’m questioning why the fuck I’m exercising and what I’m still still doing here. Living just feels so forced. It seems like I would rather die than get to a point where i can work and go to school and just LIVE. Cus i don’t even think it’s possible for me. It’s embarrassing. Ive had my dad and cousin tell me about ways to make money online, and I just feel like there is no point. I’ll keep exercising though. If I die then I can’t die being fit."
4i2ojj," How about a SA-related Achievement thread? :). As the title says. In the midst of all our struggle, why not share some victories we have had in the face of our SA? I'll start - I've managed to become comfortable conversing with the baristas at my local Starbucks. They see me in there enough to warrant me a ""regular"", so I figured why not try to work on making things less awkward for all involved when we have to interact, lol. It's going swimmingly! On another note, slightly NSFW, I took life by the throat last week and I went sunbathing at a nude beach! That was actually totally awesome and freeing and I hope to do it again some time. Then I also finally managed the courage to go into and purchase something from a sex shop. Awkward and embarrassing, but It gave me confidence when I was done, so that's good, lol What have you guys done to triumph over your SA lately? :) "
plbrco,"Bored out of my mind. What's the point?. Hi, I have always had social anxiety but it was never extremely severe. I would have a hard time initiating social interactions, but usually after a while I would become more comfortable. I have a very loving family and had a really close friend group for the past 2-3 years in high school so I was never really alone. I just started college and I kind of just feel like shit. I push myself to do more things every day and try to be outside as much as I can. I usually just walk around campus or go to the different dining halls since that's challenging enough on its own. As I have said before, it usually gets better but its been two weeks and I feel defeated. I spent 99% of my day alone and my roomate, who was one of my best friends from high school, quickly found new friends and I barely talk to him anymore. Sometimes I feel great throughout the day just for something tiny like a mean comment from my roomate about staying in the dorm all the time to make me depressed again. I spend my nights in the dorm and I'm just so bored. I feel like I'm wasting my life sitting in my room while other people are meeting new friends and going to parties. On the other hand, every time I go to meet new people or go to events that are supposed to be fun, its challenging. At some point you wonder what the point of it is. You make yourself feel bad for not being like others and going to parties and having fun, but deep down you know. Even if you were invited to or went to one, that it would be more of a challenge than fun. All of my previous friends were the ones who approached me first so I guess I'm just waiting for that to happen again. I'm just beginning to worry that it never will. If I could be happy on my own this would be much easier. I just feel like an extrovert stuck in an introvert's body."
g4od8y5," Hey, i was more or less in the same situation as you. I've always loved walking but being really anxious about other people, i stayed indoor. But now i overcame that and i've been taking long walks without too much worry. The solution is keeping going out and slowly your mind will begin to accept it as normal. As for the other people: Now you asked what to do when walking past them, i'd say everything you said is fine! During my walks i couldn't help but notice that most people either: watch who they pass by some don't some say hello and so on... My point is that most people don't really care about that, there isn't a rule. it is our mind that make that seems like it is a big deal. Sorry for my english. "
4wn8db," An open letter to no one.. This is an open letter to no one. No one will be reading this, but that’s okay. I just want to write all of this down as I have nobody to talk to. And just so we’re clear, this is not a suicide note. And if this is not appropriate content for the sub, feel free to remove it, I don't care. It’s currently ten minutes past midnight, and in about six hours my alarm clock will go off. First day of work after summer break. My pointless, dull, depressing and uneventful everyday life will resume in it’s usual form. At school I was a nobody. I was basically air. From first to seven grade I was bullied, heavily, and the teachers didn’t care. Nobody cared. Not a single student nor teacher ever stood up for me. And I didn’t either. They called me names, knowing each time they did it felt like a knife stabbing my chest. At 21 years old I still hate my name. The combinations for “funny” names by adding/changing letters feels endless. They spat in my hair, they shoved the business end of a broomstick in my eye, they pushed me, tripped me while walking behind me, shoved me into lockers, stole my crackers I bought at the store during recess, made fun of my hair and clothes, hid my stuff while I was showering after gym class, etc. Oh, and speaking of gym class; I have a thing called gynecomastia, or “puffy nipples” if you will, and don’t you think my classmates had a blast making fun of that? And don’t you think that made me feel *very* bad, and every time I didn’t have a shirt on I felt like absolute shit? Because I did. I felt *so* insecure about it. I hated not wearing a t-shirt. I would always decline invited to the beach, even though I really wanted to go. People would stare, some even chuckle and laugh, and I felt like such shit whenever someone did. It made me feel like a piece of garbage. I asked my parents to fix it surgically, but my dad just told me he had it too and it would go away. My brother had it too, and sure enough, his nipples gradually became normal looking at age 18-19, but me? 21 years old, still as big and puffy as ever. Still feel like shit whenever I’m not wearing a shirt. But what hurt me more than most of all that, was when they pretended I didn’t exist. I could ask someone a question, and they would straight up just pretend I never said anything. They would just not acknowledge my existence. I remember one day where I went through a full, normal school day without saying a single word. Not a single one. Not even a “yes” or “here” for attendance. I had one very good and very real friend, but he was a year older than me, and he had plenty of other friends, so he didn’t always have time to hang out with me. Plus, he didn’t know how bad I had it at school (he knew I wasn’t exactly Mr. Popular, but I always tried to hide the fact that I was a victim of bullying), and I always tried to make it seem as if I had other friends than him, even though I didn’t. I was very obsessed with seeming normal, trick people into thinking I had friends. Every day was the same. Go to school, be there, go home and be alone. For a good while I watched a movie every day. One movie every single day. Alone. Though I never came close to killing myself. I had so much hope for the future. “I’m still just 16, I have plenty of years to turn things around!” Though when the future arrived and I started a new school in a new town, I then realised how damaged I was. It was a boarding school, so I went from being alone 24/7, to being surrounded by 200+ people my own age 24/7. I then realised I had no social skills what so ever. I couldn’t understand that the stuff I was saying to people was weird. I couldn’t read their facial expressions until after. I understood what a freak I was, and I became afraid of social situations, because I was afraid of making a fool of myself. I thought that if I did, I would become bullied again, and I didn’t want that. I was scared to make something out of myself. I wanted to be outgoing and funny, but I just didn’t know if I tried doing something funny around people, it would just be stupid and people would think I was an idiot. I grew terrified of people. Sometimes I just locked my door, drew the curtains closed, and listened to music whilst lying on my bed feeling sorry for myself. Also, at this school, when I was 17 years old, I experienced for the very first time a girl liking me. And I had no idea to handle it. This is going t sound stupid, but this is why I never made a move on her when she obviously liked me; I convinced myself that this was all an elaborate roos to mock me. She would pretend she was interested in me, I would open up to her and tell her how I feel, and she would then laugh, run around and tell everybody what a fucking idiot I am, and they would all laugh at me. I honestly believed that happening was very realistic (I was also scared that she’d just make fun of my nipples). I’m currently 21 years old, and I have yet to have a girlfriend. I haven’t even had fucking sex. My older friend who I mentioned earlier has had sex with 19 different girls. Another current friend I have doesn’t even know his number. And if you think that I’m ugly, I’m not. I’m 6’7”, I’ve worked out a fair share over the years, and my current job is very physically demanding, so it’s fair to say even though I’m not ripped, I’m a strong guy. Also, whilst having a drinking game at a party, two separate girls at two separate parties have answered me when questioned “who in this room has had the most sexual partners?”. Both times my best friends were present, and one of the girls even knew my one friends number (19), and knew my other friend didn’t even know his. Still thought I had had more sexual partners than them. Anyways… This is my current life; I’m 21 years old, I work as a builder for my dads company, and I have severe social anxiety. When in a situation wherein I’m not 100% comfortable, I get cold sweats, feel a panicky sensation inside, and have to pee frequently. Also, if I’m in a situation where people will notice how frequent I pee (for example a car ride, where we have to *physically stop the vehicle* so that *I* can pee), I will have to pee extra frequently because I will be embarrassed at people knowing how frequent at pee. At a party where people are wandering all over the place, are drunk and there is loud music, it’s alright, because then I can pee frequently and people won’t notice (plus if it’s a possibility, I can pee outside in the woods/somewhere more hidden from peoples view). I hate my job. I absolutely fucking hate it. But what other choice do I have. My father knows about my problems, and he wants to help me, so my day at work will suit my situation (referring to the frequent urination, big problem). I would have to tell my employers about my situation, but I don’t want to do that. It’s scary. I mean, you have no idea the feeling I feel inside. It’s dead awful. After my social anxiety kicked in at the level it is now, it took me more than a full year to tell my own mother and father who are both very, very good and loving parents. I just couldn’t do it. I just want to avoid it. I mean, my job is alright I guess. I could imagine a worse job, it’s just thinking about doing this “meh” job *for the rest of my life*… But then again… Trying to get a new job or doing something different with my life would mean to take on my worst demons head on, and they are a thousand times stronger than they were just three years ago. And at that point they were already pretty big. I can’t do it. I would have to pee frequently, and at work people will notice. I would become the weird guy I’m sure of it. Just thinking about it makes me panic. I can’t do it. I have this job I hate, but at least I can do it, so I’ll just do it for the rest of my life and be miserable. Anyways… I know no one will bother reading this, but I don’t care I just wanted to write it. And if anyone does, and actually decide that the piece of shit I am deserves getting a comment, I might not even check it. I’d just feel embarrassed. I don’t know. Maybe I will. All I know is that the clock is about to strike 1am, and in roughly five hours my alarm will go off and I will have to crawl out of bed to endure yet another miserable day in my life that I will live to forget. Have a nice life everyone. I will pray for my own to change, knowing I have no hope to speak of. "
per8ie,Am I the only one who does not feel comfortable without a sweater?. My parents are always telling me to take it off and I don’t want to. I’ve literally worn sweaters at the beach and at like 110 temperature
b4a4eq," I attended a meetup event.. It was an event where you meet up and then play various board games. It didn't go that bad but not good either. I hate how I am unable to get rid of that anxious/insecure vibe I am emitting. Anxiety is clouding my mind making me unable to joke around and I can't come with funny comebacks when people say something funny/joke around with me. I only managed to come with the same boring default small talk questions (where are you from, what do you do etc.). I really am determined to improve my social skills, but every time I try to put myself out there, it is equivalent to not being able to swim and then being thrown into a stormy sea. "
ep3p00t," Small tiny steps forward are the only way if you wanna change this a bit. Also, if it's very hard for you to even go outside you might wanna consider therapy to help get another positive push. Good luck! "
g8ol1r,"How can I make myself tolerate being outside around family?. 14/M here. I have a very big family, and due to the Coronavirus situation I know that when it clears up my family is going to be throwing parties and gatherings again. I hate going to these social events. I hate being around others I don't know as well as my parents and siblings and I hate going outside in general. Everything is just so awkward and I'm essentially just suffering out there. When it's hot, I'm very uncomfortable. When it's cold, everyone is inside and then it's just as bad. I still try to go out and spend time with the older ones especially because, well, you never know. As time passes, I rethink some of my past decisions and hate myself for some of the things I didn't do with my family. Then, when I'm in that situation again and can do it, I get too scared and give up. I really don't want to lose my chance to leave a good impression on the family, while I'm still young. Suggestions?"
dp67ljz,"If you live in a major city, I bet there are meetups near you, try meetup.com. nnIf you're not ready for that, maybe try finding a new hobby that gets you outside of your house, like hiking or photography. Personally, I feel like social media and too much time on the internet screw up our psyche more than just being alone.nnRemember that people like to talk about themselves. my go to trick is to just ask tons of questions about the other person. "
evu3pou,"I guess the grass really is greener on the other side. I completely disagree with girls are born with value. From my experience, you are automatically assumed you don't know shit and can't lift moderately heavy objects and are talked down like you are a child at any hardware supply store. Physical attractiveness is the only thing that gives a woman ""value,"" and that is something not every woman has. It's much easier gain value to build and create, than to change your biological nature with cosmetics and surgery. I'm not sure where exactly you are coming from with this argument but I'm making an assumption that this is what you mean. I don't get free drinks or food, I don't have men pay for my dates, I don't get spoiled or are given or expected materialistic things. I never have men do things for me or have never had anything handed to me in my life. I never was treated with less pressure, and as an only child with neglectful parents I had to do everything including taking care of my parents. nnI understand what you mean about men earning their respect through hard work and earnings. I have never understood why some women are so obsessed with wealthy men, since most are narcassisitic jerks. A wealthy hard working man can pick up any beautiful gold digger, but a wealthy hard working woman will only pick up men who find her physically attractive. An old man is wiser, an old woman is worthless."
ika7d0," Twitchy uncontrollable Social anxiety. Hello, I’ve been suffering from social anxiety for almost 6 years now. I’m 23 years old now and for the life of me can’t get a grip on being normal and making friends and not being worried about meeting new people or attending class or events. I do have a girlfriend and am comfortable meeting people one on one if we are doing an activity such as surfing. Over the years I’ve had a hard time holding healthy relationships with my significant other due to being so damn anxious about meeting their friends or family, shit im even to anxious to meet up with my own family sometimes. Evening something as little as going into a dive shop to sign up for a boat dive had me eyes twitching from the social aspect of talking to the cashier or thinking about how I don’t have a dive buddy for the trip and need one in order to safely dive. I try to put myself out there but can’t hold it down. Whats so embarrassing is the twitching that comes along with this anxiety, it looks like I’m on drugs or just a plain weirdo having eye spasms not being able to keep eye contact. Working out and eating healthy helps alot but nothing seems to solve this issue. I also have no friends I hang out with. Please someone I need some help with this, it’s really debilitating. "
7hq8ns, hiding in the bathroom at work parties. I had to attend a Christmas party. We were stuck on a boat for 5 hours. It was hell so after 30 minutes I sat in the bathroom the whole time. I'm really scared someone noticed. I don't want to go into work today. Am I the only one who does stuff like this? 
kp4pqx,Parents. I'm 16 and I have social anxiety disorder I am also a generally really anxious person. I went to a therapist and that didn't help at all. I was like I need to see a psychiatrist so that he can prescribe me with medication cause I can't live a life like this and my parents were like nope. For some reason they strongly disagree with any kind of medication. I almost killed myself when I was 15 because social anxiety and inability to ever go outside has led me to severe suicidal depression. Life fucking sucks.
eyc2jmh, Wow you have the courage to go downtown on your own and skateboard alone while there are people around you...fml then 
cx5a3cn,"I know how you feel. I've been to plenty of customer service industry interviews where they are asking for someone ""bubbly and outgoing"". Clearly I am not either of those things and it's obvious to anyone who spends 5 minutes with me. I've been rejected from soooo many interviews. Even Mcdonalds rejected me. I did manage to get a few jobs in retail stores. I think the reason I got those jobs is because of how I present myself. I dress well and do my make up (i'm a girl) and that is how they want their ""sales"" people to look. Once I start the job they soon realise that I'm not a sales person at all. And I was constantly getting reminded of how I am supposed to be acting and being told I'm too shy and too quiet.. Anyway. In the end I started applying for call centre roles. I don't know about other people but I find it so much easier to talk on the phone than to make eye contact with people. I totally over analyse my own body language and dealing with people in person makes me so self conscious about where I am supposed to be looking, where do I put my hands... Um anyway, sorry to make this reply all about myself lol. Honestly practice does work. I went to like 5 interviews before I got my first job. I'm looking for a job now and even though I have some work history behind me I still got rejected from the last one I went to (based on my personality in my opinion, see my post in my post history to see how terribly it went.) Keep going to interviews, those interviews are practice. Every time I go to one I just count it as an experience. You really need to make a resume though. My brother went to Uni, then had no job for three years. He has severe social anxiety among other problems. He still had to put together a resume so he had something to submit. He didn't have anyone to be his reference because he had never had a job before, no work experience, he kept saying he had nothing to put on his resume. He just had to make one anyway. He used one of our neighbours as a reference because he mowed their lawn a few times. Anyway, now three years later he actually got a REAL job with no experience, and with his social and emotional issues. This is getting long, my main point was, please just type up a resume, we all had to make our first resume with next to nothing on it. And please don't give up, I felt this exact same way a few years ago."
740k8f," Meeting celebrities. Have you ever met any of your favorite celebrities like singers, band members, actors, etc and how was the experience? How did you deal with your anxiety? I once bumped into one of my favorite artists at a club (his gig was there and I was basically waiting for him......) and there wasn’t anyone else at the club except me and my friend at the time and then this artist just walks in, I freak out, my friend doesn’t know what to do either, it was hella awkward. He stands there, right in front of my eyes and I force myself to say ”hi” and that’s all I could say, I couldn’t get anything else out of my mouth. He keeps staring at me and says hi too and kind of waits for me to say something else, but since I don’t, he leaves and waves at us. I could’ve died right there, it was a moment I had been waiting for months and I couldn’t say anything, I just froze. In front of my favorite person, like ever. Since then I’ve been scared of attending his gigs, because of the possiblity of bumping into him AGAIN and him remembering this awkward moment between us (he doesn’t remember me, I know.) but anyways! I hate anxiety. :-) "
ieo5bk,"Social anxiety is ruining my life..I don’t wanna live it anymore. Just venting to myself don’t have a choice. Not looking for attention but I just need to vent no one else to talk to anyways.I’m a 17 yr old girl-and I’m living with ptsd and as a result severe social anxiety. My father was a schizophrenic and hung himself when I was very small and I woke up and found his body just hanging there lifeless I can remember when I touched him hoping that he was alive.everything abt me changed as I got older I have no friends not a single one no social life nothing I feel so lonely. How do ppl make friends? I spend my life indoors either playing the game or doing something else and my family always gets mad at me because I never go anywhere but I just I can’t take this anymore everytime I step outside I’m always so anxious, scared ppl are looking at me judging , thinking I’m ugly or I’m weird or awkward.i can’t even keep eye contact, I always think I’m walking weird or that other ppl notice that I’m anxious. I just dint know how to talk to ppl without being super anxious.Even going to the fcking grocery store is a pain I’d rather just stay hungry sometimes than even go because of my anxiety. I have panics attacks sometimes whenever I go outside and I’m around a lot of ppl even yesterday I went out the house for the first time in a month took the bus with a lot of passengers I felt like I was abt to die I just wanted to go home .Even Going to the mall I feel overwhelmed, counting my steps, looking around to see if anyone’s looking at me. I wish I could just hide in a shell somewhere and never come out. I dropped out of regular school because of this started homeschooling now. How am I gonna ever live onmy own , work a job , go out have friends have a life if I’m like this go out have a life I hate myself so much I have no confidence weed and alcohol helps me sometimes to socialize that’s when I truly feel like myself but I’m not even allowed to do that right now.

r04xuo,"I need an advice for a formal event i’m attending on Saturday. This might sound odd, but it’s a family event and i’m so f*** scared. Backstory, i was adopted (I’m the only one in my family who was adopted) so i’ve always felt a little different from everyone (even though i know everyone loves me bla bla bla). The problem is, i’m not super close with my cousins, or aunts and uncles (i have 12 cousins, and a lot of aunts and uncles), while all of them are all super close with each other. I’m talking they all hang at the beach all the time or hang out on the weekends. To make things worse, all my cousins are millennials and are now doctors, nurses, engineers and have kids of their own! Meanwhile, I’m graduating college in December and i don’t have a job lined up yet. The thing is, this event is a celebration of my grandparents 65th anniversary, so i have to be there. I have super bad social anxiety, which acts up when i’m in a room full of people who i don’t know or are not comfortable with. My parents  and brother don’t truly understand about my social anxiety, and won’t let me just cling to them the entire event especially because I’m 21 years old now. I’m so nervous for this event (it’s a really formal event at a country club) and i don’t know how it will go for me mentally. I suck at talking to my cousins and huge family, and i feel everyone will expect to hear me talk when i hate talking. I could really use advice about how to attend this event and make conversation with my family (or just how to act in general). i’m thinking of hiding in the bathroom for a good portion of the time:("

ob55t1," The 80/20 Principle. If there is only one thing I could teach to my younger self, it would probably be the 80/20 principle, which states that states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes. The reason the 80/20 rule is so important is because time is our most valuable resource. The best way to take advantage of our precious time is to focus most of our attention on the few things that will make the biggest difference in our lives. I believe that the 80/20 principle, when utilized, can help improve social anxiety. Every day, we wake up and we have thousands of choices. If we do not understand the 80/20 principle, then we are bound to waste our time, make bad decisions, and focus on the things that don’t matter. I’m currently 21 years old, and I’m choosing to put my time and energy towards the following things: * Being as healthy as I can be. * Cultivating good friendships and relationships. * Learning as much as I can during my youth. * Building a successful and meaningful career that will lead to financial freedom. Using the 80/20 principle, each of these 4 facets can further be broken down into smaller pieces. For example, “being as healthy as I can be” can be broken down into these core elements: * Exercising daily. * Having good sleep hygiene. * Eating healthy well-balanced meals and drinking sufficient water. * Having a good social support system Obviously, there is lot more to life and to being healthy, but for the sake of this article, I want to keep things short and concise. Going back to my example, once I have these core elements, I can break things down even further. For example, “exercising daily” can be broken down into the following components: * Weightlifting three times per week. * Walking 10k steps per day. * Playing tennis on the weekends. The example above is just one illustration of how the 80/20 principle might work in practice. Another way I use this principle is when I need to decide what tasks to accomplish during the day. I usually break my daily tasks down by what’s important and by what’s urgent. For example, when I woke up this morning, I knew that my most important task of the day was to write this article. The reason this task was so important is because one of the things I want to do in my life is be a writer. I want to publish my own book in the next few years, and I know that in order for me to get there, I need to first practice and build an audience through my blog, through reddit, and through my social media. One of the reasons I love writing is because I want to help as many people as I can. The examples above demonstrate why it’s important not only to use the 80/20 rule on big picture things, like what you want to do with your life, but also on the small picture stuff, like how you can break down your goals into daily actions and habits. Self-awareness is important. You need to decide what you want in life, and then you need to figure out how to use your energy in a way that is effective and efficient. Being burned out and feeling overwhelmed is no fun. Let’s all use the 80/20 principle to the best of our abilities so that we can live lives of focus, of contentment and of incremental improvement. "
siudlj," I can never take a hint. It’s like I can never trust when someone is interested in me. I really need it spelled out for me that someone likes me. I’m too anxious to take a chance I had a huge crush on this girl in high school but she rejected me. Then like a year later all of a sudden she DM me and we started talking I was so happy and excited she reached out but also confused and didn’t know to react since I was already rejected by her. We started talking all the time and she invited me to her grad party. I couldn’t make it because of senior week. Then all of a sudden she says she’s going to the same place I am, and says “maybe we’ll run into eachother!” We did end up running into each other on the boardwalk but I never asked her to hangout She’d say stuff like “I wanna see *this movie*” “Maybe I could visit you at college!” “Wait is there a party tonight?” The whole time I just assumed she didn’t actually mean any of it and was just saying this stuff. Again I was really confused and scared I was just gonna get rejected again. The one time I finally let my guard down and invited her to hangout I got ghosted The same patterns have followed in relationships after that. I get more and more nervous everytime to the point where I just shut down and I’m closed off. I’m too afraid to make a move o ask someone out no matter how interested they seem "
dkmk0xv," That's how Tinder tends to be, for me anyway, everyone on there is usually boring, generic, and uninteresting. But! It's been a good outlit for me to build social skills that I do not have, and I can unmatch and wipe it all away like it never happened. The more you talk the better you'll get at it, it's like riding a bike, you're gonna fall and cut yourself, might even need stitches, but every time you get back on that bike you go a little farther. "
qxzera,"Should I ask my friend why she's been acting different around me?. As of now, I (19M) am a lonely community college freshman who lives at home. I go to school, go to work, and sit at home alone because I have no friends here anymore. I was unpopular in high school and I never had a friend group. I was in the drama club, though, and I did meet a few really nice girls who occasionally would invite me to hang out. But since I was shy and kind of unpopular (and in the closet) in high school, I don't think the majority of their friends wanted to include me in their ""main group"" (I live in a small, cliquey town where people can be very exclusive. My graduating high school class had under 200 students). In that group, I met the closest thing I have to a best friend, though: **Brittany** (19F, fake name). Brittany and I have had a lot of fun memories together and I really love her. Like I said, I didn't have a ""friend group"", but senior year, Brittany and **her best friend, Rose** (19F, fake name) used to hang out with me quite often. We'd have movie nights, go out to lunch, etc. Those were some of the best times I had in high school, and I'm sad I only really experienced it for a few months. Right after high school ended, I didn't see Rose at all. Every time I reached out to Brittany and Rose, asking if they wanted to hang out, only Brittany would say yes. Rose was always ""too busy"" for me, but never for anyone else. She started acting really different around me, and things felt awkward. On 4th of July, Rose and I were at a mutual friend's party during the day (Brittany was out of town), and about 4 people including me got into Rose's car to get dinner and then watch the fireworks together in the park. Instead, they dropped me off at my house, went to dinner without me, and then watched the fireworks together while I stayed home alone on 4th of July. That crushed me. There was only one thing that happened that I could possibly think of that made Rose turn on me like that. I have a brother on the Autism spectrum. He's not a creep at all, but sometimes he unintentionally makes people uncomfortable just because he's so talkative and doesn't pick up on social cues. I found out that he had been sending her messages over Instagram at like 1 in the morning, which made Rose block him. I had a firm talk with him about why he shouldn't be doing that, and he immediately stopped. I apologized to Rose about that and she was cool about it, telling me not to worry about it. I asked Brittany if Rose was upset with me about that or if there was something else on her mind, and she said no. I never told Brittany about the 4th of July thing because I didn't want it to seem like I was gossiping or making myself out to be the victim. But Rose was so kind to me before. She was always complimentary to me, always went out of her way just to say hi to me at school or give me a hug when I was having a bad day, and she was originally the one who would reach out and invite me to our hangouts with Brittany. So it was really obvious that something was bothering her and this uncertainty still bothering me after all these months. But now she's at college, living her best life, has tons of new friends, and we haven't really talked at all since. I've been tempted to reach out and ask what's going on, but I always chicken out. The last thing I want to do to her is make her more uncomfortable around me than she already is. But at the same time, I don't want to just say ""Fuck her. She doesn't like me so I don't like her"" because I really don't think she is a mean person. I just really miss the old Rose. With Thanksgiving coming up, everyone from my high school class is coming home. Brittany and I have been keeping in touch and talking about hanging out when she comes home. I'm probably gonna see Rose again at a little get-together thing Brittany is having, and I don't want things to be bad. It's hard because Brittany and I are so close, but she's closer with Rose than she is with me, so I don't want there to be any tension. I'm kind of stuck in high school mentally, just due to the fact that I haven't gone away to college or made any new friends yet. Should I ask her about it or just pretend nothing happened? TL;DR Someone I used to consider a very dear friend started acting different towards me. I don't know what to do when I see her again"
d30as6e,"So much good information from there!nnThe most important thing that you need to decide at first, do you want to change? This is the most important thing. For a long time I was happy alone and seriously even if I could go back in time, I wouldn't change that, at most I will just introduce the idea of a possibility to change. I was perfectly happy and I don't consider that part of my life that negative. There's nothing wrong with being alone, as long as you are happy with it.nnIf you want to change, then you can read my comment, otherwise, continue on your life. Also, anything that I will write here will be related to my own experience and how I personally felt, I don't know if it apply to you but it did to me.nnIf you want to change, you need to know is that it will be hard, it will take times (a lot of it), it will be so slow that you won't even see yourself change that much (but believe me, you will) and you will need to persevere even though you will doubt yourself and feel like crap some time.nnYou also need to be less negative about yourself, you are not hopeless and you are not worthless. You do have negative trait though, everyone does, but learn to be more optimistic about it. There's some stuff that you will be able to change, like your uninteresting life, and others that you won't be able to change but fix a little bit or at least learn to accept them.nnLet's start pour uninteresting life, why stop you from having one? What interest you and how can you do more of it? I really liked movies, so I started to go regularly, once a week most of the time, often more. I really like SciFi so I started to read more of it, I also started to go to convention, often in cities far away. I was interested in climbing, I did it, same for hiking (though I would really like to do more but transport is an issue, I'm working on that). Find more hobbies and try them!nn&gt; Therapists never helped as I have trouble opening up to people and it always seemed like I don't really have enough of a problem or mental disorder as other people do.nnYou just identified a problem, fix that! That's the kind of thing that I'm talking about. We all have issues that stop us from doing what we want. Now if you want to do them, fix theses issues. Again, it's not easy but you have to start by a first step. From there identify more and fix more. You have trouble opening up to peoples, why? Are you afraid they will judge you? How does some people do it then? Can you make sure they won't judge you? A therapist is there to help you, not judge you, he has seen far worst than you believe me, but the only way you can believe that is by trying yourself, push yourself to open up to him.nnI still have huge trouble to open up to people, I have been working on my social anxiety for the past 3 years probably (to being able to open up to people probably for the past 10 months I would say). I do push myself constantly to try to do it more. Little by little I succeed.nnAnother thing, stop lying. They know you lie, that will make them feel uncomfortable with you, they won't act ""genuinely"" with you like you would in real life. If you don't feel comfortable talking about something, just say that. If they push you, keep telling them you prefer not to. At one point you will need to open up though, but do everything at your own pace.nnI never done RP so I can't really give any advice about that. Any social thing is great though so keep doing it. Even though you may lose theses friends, keep doing it, you will meet other great people and make more friends. If you like RP, what about LARP or DND in real life? In my city there's a pub where you can play board games and every week they host a DND game. Look in your city if you have something similar. If you are too afraid to go, find out what stop you and then try to find ways to get around that issue or to fix it. Are you afraid that they will judge you? Contact the GM privately by email, tell him your story (don't have to go in as much detail as you did here but just tell him you enjoy RP but does suffer from social anxiety and you may be a little too shy) and ask if it's an issue, he may have some advice or maybe even able to convince you everything will be alright (which probably will, more players is always good and even if you don't do much it's better than nothing). I met some of my best friends at that pub I was talking about. They host weekly werewolf games and I started to go regularly nearly 2 years ago. At first I stayed in my corner, not saying much, mostly observing, but little by little I started to talk, to take more place, and even though I'm usually not outgoing, I am in theses events because I developed some confidence there.nntl;dr: Find why you are like this and fix it little by little. Try new hobbies and push yourself out of your comfort zone but at your own pace. "
em11oai," I'm a very kind and respectful person. I like to skateboard and draw as hobbies. It's extremely difficult to introduce myself to anyone due to the fact that i have social anxiety disorder. But, if someone approaches me and talks, i could handle it pretty well. No one does and thats fine, i understand why the wouldn't. "
o3wqln," I successfully turned down the pressure to say YES today!. So a girl I like (a really stuck up but beautiful girl) me and her get along on a very personal level (like she doesn’t think I’m weird at all lol) and theirs obvious attraction (former employee; pandemic made her move back home) Anyway I was on a beach trip with my family this weekend and she texted me saying she in town and invited me to an event… She asked if I was coming back home and I said yes I’m coming back later today… After this I asked her how long was she staying and she never responded… This bothered me because I was honestly very socially drained and physically drained from the trip and just wanted to be in my own bed, and we had already spoken about hanging out in the summer but I didn’t like that she just expected me to drop whatever I had going on my life today. I would appreciated if she had asked me last night, so I had time to mentally prepare or sometime in advanced, and her not responding to how long she was staying was a clear red flag to me that she doesn’t respect my time… Anyway even though I made it home early in time, I told her I couldn’t go and it honestly felt great to say it because I was stressing out thinking of every single way to make it back in time and not let her down. But I knew deep down she didn’t need me there and would be with her group of friends regardless, I would probably have been just her “buddy” for the day or something (even if more had happen Im honestly not that driven by my desires enough to forsake my own comfortability) She’s a pretty girl but I’m looking for a mature partner who will always be there, someone who won’t play mind games with me on ig dm’s and attempt to take advantage of my clear weakenesses ( I had an ok time despite my anxiety attack last night at the casino/resort area…everything was too stimulating the lights, music, and especially the crowds of people) "
qcz68b,"Just a rant. I have had GAD and depression for a couple of years. I think I’ve always had some social anxiety but recently it’s gotten worse. For me, social anxiety is like generalizedanxiety on steroids. I’ve had construction going on at my house recently and I have gone out of my way to avoid walking by windows and going into the kitchen where the construction people could see me. Also, I don’t feel like my family really understands the kind of anxiety that I feel. Pretty much all of them are more outgoing, although some of them do have there own anxiety struggles, it doesn’t necessarily affect social aspects of there life. I’m 19 and don’t really have any friends near me because they all went away to different colleges. School for me is still online, which is fine by me, but that means that I don’t interact with people in person. I try to get myself to go out and like walk around campus or something but I have to hype myself up so much. I also don’t have my license so if I want to go somewhere I walk/bike which I really don’t mind but I think I use it as an excuse to not put myself out there. My little rant is over, thanks for reading:) lol"
ddmped4,"Mostly browsing the internet, fortunately participating passionately in discussions about certain games or things I'm looking forward to with other forum-goers. There's that. I think it's just the physical feeling of loneliness and the sense of having looked at the same interiors and sitting, eating, sleeping routine, that gets to me. As I said I did go shopping once or twice and I remember enjoying the fresh air and taking in the feeling of being outside for once.nnIt's just that every so often, I get really self-conscious about what's been happening lately and it's not a whole lot and that usually puts me into this anxiety-mode where I extrapolate what I'm doing right now to what I might be doing in the future and then I can't turn my brain off from all the negative feelings I get."
fny3plx,"Your idea sounds pretty good for starting, cause it gives a lot of room for variating the level of embarrassment or potential awkwardness! Haha, yeah! You can literally try to laugh, act clownish, whatever you want. When I was in a store a few times with my sibling, I was talking loudly, acting clownish, and trying to gain people's attention. It's not easy, especially when you are in a line to pay. Usually there are some people behind you looking at you. When I was trying to talk to my sibling out loud about weird things etc. Trying to act like there would be no people, it was difficult. Everyone was quiet, and I was the opposite talking and acting weird. When I was saying something, people started looking at me. Then self-consciousness mode 100% haha. Also, there is one good thing to practice. Being slow. Usually when I was in a line in the store, I was trying to do everything fast and be prepared for everything. Now, I am doing everything being very slow, and not something like, holding a banknote 10 minutes before paying. So, I feel like dropping all these little things helps in the long term. Because we are doing these things to alleviate our anxiety in a short term, but it makes it worse in the long term. I've also thought about doing things like asking ridiculous things in a store for example but the thing that keeps me from doing it is that I live in a rather small town, so I'll meet these people many more times probably and the likelihood that they remember me is a lot higher then in let's say New York Same, that's the problem for me as well. That's why I am doing some stuff when I am far from my neighbourhood. I run regularly, so sometimes I have some small talk with people that know me. How did you deal with knowing that the people that were in your challenges could remember you or when you knew that you'll have to deal with them a lot in the future? Tbh, I don't have easy time with that. Sometimes I said that my social anxiety is more towards people that know me rather than strangers. Hm... one thing that helps me is to not categorize people. I mean that there is no one more important than someone else. So, I am trying to perceive people close to me as they would be no more important than a stranger. I've recently started practicing being a bit more open about myself. I am just trying to say about my plans, things I do, my thoughts etc. Being the same person IRL like I am here. I am perceived as being a quiet loner, but you can see here how talkative I can be. So, when one of my friends (we almost have no contact anymore, because I don't want to talk) asked how I was doing, I started to tell more about me. I need to show my true self. Even my family members don't know me at all, because I just don't talk. It's more like performing and saying prepared things or avoiding conversations. They would see that I am a completely different person, but for some reasons I hide myself. Also, conversations are more enjoyable when I talk without pretending, like here."
mmltec," How to accept your social anxiety (disorder)?. As a part of you? I feel like im less than because of it, basic things are because of it. I feel that im lagging behind my peers.I would be sexier, funnier, more confident and better to be around by without it. I would have more friends and wouldn't fear intimacy that much. I would be able to go places that have lots of people like a beach, concert or market and enjoy it instead of zoning out. It doesn't make me attractive or quirky. I dont think normal people can ever understand this since they dont themselves suffer from it. "

g4az2dy,"Hey bro! I'm 18 and used to also have Social Anxiety until I was 15, so I completely get what you mean. Feeling like you aren't interesting is one of the worst feelings when it comes to Social Interactions, because you feel like missing alot of opportunities and friendships. What I suggest you to do if you can, is to join clubs or places whete you can meet people with the same interests as yours : what are your hobbies bro ? I love piano and skating for example, that allowed me to meet new people during high school and even outside. I also suggest you to asks for directions and for the te in the street (making small talk with stranger) : you'll then get used to talk more often and it'll lower your anxiety 🚀 Hope these tips helped you. I actually have an Instagram page which teaches about Social Skills : You can also hit me up in my DMs so we can fix your issue together and take your social skills to a level you've never seen. Take care bro, I hope we'll work together soon🙌"
cwiqau4,"Oh absolutely, there have certainly been times where I've misread their behavioral changes and been wrong about them, which is somewhat reassuring when I start freaking out about losing a friend, but on the reverse side of that, I've also unfortunately been correct more often than not.nnI'm so terrified of losing people that I pay painstakingly close attention to how they interact with me or respond to things I say or do. I'll notice even slight changes in the way someone texts to me, from the way they spell things commonly, phrases, the density of their texts and stuff like that. If someone has typically in depth or at least long lasting conversations with me, and then becomes even remotely more short with me or whatever, I'll pick up on it instantly. I notice the patterns pretty quickly. The content or nature of someone's jokes might change, and I'll notice that, and question why that's changed. nnIt's hard to explain, but it's like each person, even through just texting has a personality to their typing, specific to the recipient, and I'll notice when that personality towards me changes even in the slightest way. That's usually followed by a 24/7 state of dwelling on it and freaking out, which then triggers my issues with depression and it becomes a bit of a whirlwind of my entire life falling apart, at least in my eyes. The person in question usually has absolutely no idea. In the case I mentioned in my original comment with my best friend, they don't even seem to realize the terror that's been sweeping through me the past couple of weeks, and the one time I calmly asked if I was being phased out, they snapped on me so I've learned to leave those fears hidden away now and just wait and see what happens."
4szr9z," 16, Never kissed or been Very romantic with a Girl, help?. Hi, I'm about to turn 16. I'm from the US, and i'm 5'6, Half Thai, half white. I'm considered handsome, ""hot"", and attractive by girls. I'm muscular (have a v cut, 6 pack) and play lots of soccer, one of the best players in my school. I get high honors regularly. I'm ambiverted, maybe a bit more inteoverted, as i'm shy arlund new people (esecially girls) and can be loud and crazy only witg my 4 closest friends. I'm entering 10th grade, 9th grade was my 1st year of school with girls since 3rd grade, as I went to an all boys school since 4th grade (ugh). Generally i'm a pretty nice guy, not in the popular crowd, but not a loser either. When I talk to girls, I try to make sure I'm nice, but tease/flirt with them too. Most (not all, but it seems the majority) of my friends have all kissed, gotten nudes and dated girls. A couple of my friends claim to have had sex too. I feel like shit, because I'm pretty shy and awkward around girls, and simply making small talk with a girl I like is a big deal, so kissing and sex/romance seems so foreign to me. I'm just worried about my lack of experience, and whether love/dates/sex will actually come if I try hard to look for that stuff, or if I should let myself stumble upon a girl I like? It's so dissapponting, having girls say they like u and being very attractive (I swear I'm not vain lol) and being to socially awkward to make a move, It sucks. All comments and advice appriciated, thanks! "

pn8gd6,"I finally told my parents I might ah e social anxiety. I told them the difference between introversion, shyness and social anxiety. Also this was translated from Spanish so some words might be wrong. I told them through text even though we are in the same house lol.. Social anxiety. Shyness and introversion explained. I really think I have social anxiety (I don't like that word in Spanish in English it is social anxiety) or social phobia. I found a video that explains a little, I saw a thousand videos and I think that's what it is. But I couldn't find a video in Spanish that would explain it perfectly. Then I will try too. Introversion and extroversion: It's how people are classified and how you are and where you were born, you can't change that. An introvert is someone who prefers to spend more time alone than with others, who does not like parties so much and being with so many people. An extrovert is someone who prefers to be surrounded (I don't remember how they say it in English) who likes to be around people who love parties etc. Shyness: someone who is a little scared or nervous in some cases, but it is not so intense and it is a character trait. (A way of being, they are there and it is not a bad thing) but if you can make friends ... it is difficult for them but they do it and when they know them more they are no longer nervous with them. Someone shy can be an introvert but he doesn't have to be, he can also be an extrovert ... that means that if that person is an introvert he prefers being alone most of the time but he gets nervous with other people but he doesn't mind not having so many friends. A shy and outgoing person is someone who gets nervous with people but still finds it difficult to be with people all the time even if they don't talk as much. Someone with social phobia / social anxiety. (Socially anxious) you feel fearful in almost all situations. (There are two types of generalized social anxiety (I do not know if it is written here) that is that he is afraid in everything that has to do with socialization ... it can be asking for food ... just being surrounded by people, walking outside where there are houses or cars etc! A person with specific social anxiety is not afraid in all situations, but most are, but there may be some who feel perfectly fine, for example they may just feel nervous talking face to face with someone, but not walking outside. Basically social anxiety is twice as much if not worse than being shy. It prevents you from doing many things that you probably want to do. It makes you exaggeratedly very anxious and nervous even just sitting at school may make you nervous. Social anxiety is not normal, It is not a personality trait. It may be generic (but not as likely) if someone in the family has some type of anxiety (it does not have to be social) there is a greater chance that you l or have. But most of the time the (develops I don't remember how it is said in Spanish) will appear…. This happened in many ways for example if parents are very protective or strict ... but most of the time it happens when someone has been bullied (they have been made fun of and it affected them a lot) for example a person may have already been shy and someone bullying them for a long time and it affects them a lot. That can turn into social anxiety. Social anxiety is not something you can just put down. I don't think it can ever be completely cured ... if there is a way to handle it and reduce it a lot but only with the help of a professional. Someone with social anxiety can't just talk to themselves and will be cured. No. It takes a lot of work. So now that I have explained what all that is, I'm going to say because I think I have social anxiety (I'm not totally sure but maybe 70% sure that's enough) someone shy wouldn't sit in fear just sitting in school or in a part where someone is in front of you (an example in the choir when we practice at the table ... there are people in front and next to me ... when we are singing it is not so difficult because others are looking at their books and lyrics but when the songs are not on the paper and everyone is just looking everywhere I feel as if they are watching me and the only thing I can do is look down and not see them in the eyes only that they are talking. I shake really ugly and I feel like I want to GET OUT OF THERE FAST. That alone is an example. Now because I have social anxiety… hmm it's not difficult… okay you remember when I was in kindergarten and I told you and I peed in front of the whole class while I was presenting? Okay… before it was my turn no I I agree as if I wanted to go to the bathroom I don't think I was putting up with it before but when it was my turn I got very nervous and I asked the teacher if I could and to the bathroom but she said that when I finished presenting .. but I was there in front of everyone Maybe it was because I was very anxious or maybe I just believed because I put up with it a lot. (I don't remember) BUT !!! I did not always speak in elementary (and still did not speak) but I don't remember feeling nervous I just didn't want to talk. In third grade when Mrs. Arbelaez's ugly teacher laughed at me a lot, for a whole year. All changed. I don't remember well because it was a long time ago but what I do remember was that after she laughed at me for a long time I was just very nervous in all situations. Before it was not. I even remember that when we were in the computer lab doing an exam on the computer WITH HEARING AIDS I heard many teachers behind me laughing (It was not me) and I assumed it was my own, so I took off my headphones and tried to listen to you. that they were talking and since he can't hear I assumed it was me so I started crying. And it made me feel every time I heard people laughing. Not now It's ugly but I still feel exaggeratedly very nervous in situations that I don't think are just shy! And telling me that (I’ll get over it) that it will happen to me is not true (if I have social anxiety) because it will always be a problem only that someone helps me and a much smaller problem is already over. But in case you are going to say that I love parties and going to the mole and stuff and I don't have social anxiety ... that's not true. You may be an outgoing person with social anxiety. I like all those things and I want to be people although it is very difficult to haveses if I go to parties and everything but I just sit there watching people without speaking BUT I have fun! Y alfin después como 35 minutos de escribir todo esto a mano. (Lo escribí todo yo sola) después de hacer todo esto para que ustedes entienda PORFAVOOOORRRR léanlo todo y con cuidad porque tarde mucho y quiero que lo lean TODO. No tienen idea de cuantos videos vi de social anxiety como unos 100 (y no estoy exagerando) y no me vallan a decir que porque me dormí muy tarde. Porque después de que acabamos de limpiar el carro luego luego empecé a buscar videos en español para enseñarles (eso fueron muchas horas) y escribí todo esto también. Entonces PLEASEEE léanlo TODO!!! y díganme lo que piensan."
foyads6," Break things down into more manageable steps. If making friends is too hard for you right now start by doing things that are doable. For example, make a habit of just saying ""hi"" to strangers when you go for a walk. Or maybe start by chatting to people online. If this is too easy, try voice chatting. These are just example because I don't know exactly where you are at. You can probably think of better ones because you know you better than me, but if you just persistently do mildly to moderately difficult things gradually they will get easier and you can start tackling harder tasks. Progress is slow and you will feel like giving up, but don't. You just have to have faith in the process. To quote Pattabhi Jois ""Practice. All is coming."" "
d57r8lv," I'm going to try doing that this week. I bought The Hitchhiker's Guide Trilogy (5 books) last week and decided I would take a 15 min (-ish) bike ride to go to the tip of a park (a huge stretch that is surrounded by water) and I would read my books there. Then Pokemon Go came out (-ish, got the APK since I'm in Canada and its not officially released here) and it just gave me another incentive to leave my home. I haven't taken my bike out for a ride in at least 2 years. I just haven't gotten around to do it yet since it rained and it was cold all week last week and during the whole weekend. My sister has been playing like 20 minutes on my phone while I was driving yesterday. She enjoyed it. Installed it on her phone, and we might be going to hangout together outside too. As for other people, I haven't gone out yet. I don't know if other people are playing too in my city. I haven't seen many hangout spots yet. "
gzsrki,"Will I look weird going to a pool by myself?. I’m 14. I’m at my dads house this week - My dads house has a small neighborhood community pool that you need a key fob to get into. It’s currently 96 outside. Most people that go to that pool are elementary - middle school aged kids, with their parents or groups of high schoolers. Everybody is usually there with a friend and I’ve never seen anyone there by themselves. Now with covid we are supposed to social distance in the pool but idk if anyone is doing that. I don’t have any friends where my dad lives so inviting someone over isnt an option. I would have to go by myself. My dad doesn’t want to go. I feel like I would look weird and people would judge me. I’m really tall, really pale at the moment, my swim suit is bright orange/pink and my hair is a faded purple color. Last time I was at the pool people (middle-high school aged) stared and were whispering and moving away from me and some parents were staring at me. I felt really awkward. And it wasn’t fun by myself."
4w50vp,"Sharing a Room with Two Strangers, for a Week. I just got this new job and as a way for everyone to get to know each other the company has rented out some cabins that we will live in for a week. I'm 19 and this is my first job. I will share a cabin (maybe even a room) with two complete strangers. I am very anxious about this since I am pretty introverted and feel extremely uncomfortable about sleeping in the same room as two other dudes that I've never met. I can't tell them I'm sick because part of the whole thing is an introduction and education about how the job will go down. So I have to be there. I just don't want to share a fucking room/cabin with two strangers for a week. The place is about an hour away from my home, therefore I feel like it would be better if I just drove there every morning and drove home every night. What do I do?"
e5n299," depressed af this winter. what can i do to get through this darkness. its cold and dark all the time and my sa seems to be worse, like why is winter this depressing. can it not just be summer again. w what you guys do all winter? ive got serious cabin fever but my sa is worse than summer so going out just seems stressful. dont know what to do, time is going so slow.

8skrnr," My Only Friend Doesn't Want To Spend Time With Me. I'm a 19M who graduated high school last year. The only friend I had all through high school and up until now doesn't seem to care about me. He was always a little hesident about spending time with me outside of school but now he just completely makes up excuses to avoid me even though I haven't done anything but be a good friend in return. He is a pretty shy person in general and never invites me to do anything. About 1.5 months ago I invited him to see Avegeners Infinity War knowing he likes superhero movies but he came up with the excuse, ""I would need to go to the bathroom during the movie and miss some of it."" I few days ago I invited him to join me at the local outdoor swimming pool and at first he couldn't give me a solid answer and then said it depends how much homework he has. The thing is he's unemployed and retaking an English course that is only 3 days a week. I asked him about the pool again yesterday and he acted like he didn't know what I was talking about. Should I tell him I'm done with his crap and give up on him? "
phxq33,"I have been a hermit for so long I don't even know what to do outside. It's not that I don't ever go outside but I usually only go when someone invites me. Which is like once a month. I am started to feel really sick of sitting at my computer all day. But I always end up doing it anyway. I want to go outside but every time I start to have these doubts. Where do I even want to go? What will I do? I live in a small town so I have to use my car to get around. So one of the first anxious thoughts is - where will I park? People can be really hostile towards those who park somewhere they aren't supposed to. There are Facebook groups dedicated to vandalizing badly parked cars. I myself ended up with a ""You park like a cunt"" sign behind my windshield once, just because I was not a local and didn't know I shouldn't have parked ""correctly"". My second thought is - where will I go? I don't want to go to any shops because I don't need to buy anything. There is no other reason to walk around town for me. I can't go to any bars or pubs, I am definitely not ready for that. There are no museums, no theaters, cinemas are closed or only play movies at 10pm. If I do end up going somewhere neutral like a park it feels pointless because the reason I went out is to have human contact. But I just kinda hope it... happens to me? I hope that I won't have to initiate it. I have no idea what people do when they go outside. How do they discover which activities are available in the area? Yeah, and the typical city people advice of Reddit, ""just join a club or take up a hobby"" doesn't apply here. If these thigs exist here they are definitely not advertised anywhere. Does nepotism rule the world? Even when it comes to going out? Am I fucked if I already don't have friends as a starting point? I live in a society where social circles are pretty closed off. People can be extremely cold at first, before they get to know you. I just feel so fucking awkward when other people can see me. When they can judge my looks, my posture, my facial expressions, my clothes."
ilgwss,"I got invited to a group trip but am worried about my SA. How do I enjoy myself and not worry so much?. One of my good friend's and her bf invited me on a weekend vacation. It's a rare occasion to get to spend this much time together because she lives far away and I have also been dying for a vacation. The issue is that there will be 2 other couples and one single guy there too; all of whom I've never met and we will all be sharing a cabin. I initially was not going to go but my friend assured me that she wanted to spend the entire time with me bc she didn't know the other girls that well and the reason she asked me to tag along was because of that. She also said the guys would mostly be around the guys and vice-versa. That honestly made me feel better and like the trip wouldn't be bad but I keep psyching myself out that I will come across as awkward or embarrass myself by blushing profusely. I feel anxious just thinking about being around so many new people because I am not great in social gatherings and never know what to talk about with new people. Like it just feels so forced and unnatural when I try making conversation. &amp;#x200B; I also get so clammy when attention is completely directed on me and feel like I'm going into this with people ready to judge me since mostly everyone already knows everyone else. I'm also skeptical on whether or not this is going to be a romantic set-up since I'm the only single gal there and know my friends have tried talking this guy up who's also going before even though they claimed it wouldn't at all be a set-up so there's that added pressure and anxiety too. &amp;#x200B; **I just keep thinking about the most menial events like everyone sitting together and me just awkwardly being there, not knowing what to do. I actually do want to go and we will only be around each other for 2 full days so I'm trying to calm down &amp; prepare myself for what to expect. How do I get through this trip when social gatherings cause me such social anxiety?**"
etiuyh,"Almost had an anxiety attack at school today. So today in 9th period (study hall) the class was over and I was looking forward to getting home for the weekend. As the bell rang, I went over to my locker to get my coat (decently long walk). When I’m anxious I am out of breath and when I got outside it was windy and rainy, so that is the perfect recipe for disaster lol. The wind+rain+out of breath+anxiety got to be too much and I had to put my head down when walking and honestly I’m surprised I didn’t freak out on spot.. Also I didn’t see my bus number at first so I was so close to having my first anxiety attack"
ohzv7d,"Does your voice change whenever you're anxious around people?. Hi guys, so I have debilitating social anxiety. I'm 21 and had it since I was in elementary school and this has been happening to me for as long as I can remember, ever since I developed social anxiety at least. Whenever I talk to ANYONE outside my family (since I'm not shy around them) my voice changes. It doesn't matter if I've known them for 5 years or 5 seconds. I have a different voice around people outside my family. It's been happening since I was a kid and I haven't spoken about it till now. I feel the voice whenever I'm shy and insecure, which is around. Basically everyone. It's like a different persona. And it is, since obviously I'm not myself around people and hide my entire personality. My voice is higher pitched and sometimes it's even hard to speak. I sound like a completely different person. When I'm by myself or around my family members, my voice is deeper, not as meek sounding, very expressive, and just myself. I hate this so much, it's been ruining my life and not allowing me to live. I've been suffering at school, jobs, or even during small talk. I even had the voice with friends I knew for 5-6 years, who eventually left me because of how dreadfully boring I was due to the anxiety. I have a very extreme case and have sought out psychological help though it hasn't gone further than just being talked to and basically told to ""be more confident"" during therapy sessions, and somehow, nothing ever helped me. I'm no better than I was as a kid. I've shaken a lot for no reason, during completely normal interactions, even doctor's appts when they came too close to me and held my hand since I felt like they were watching and judging my every move. I'm so self conscious around people I constantly feel like all eyes are on me, that people are observing my every move and notice even when I lift a finger. I have very low self-esteem and fear I'll never get better. It's not just the average shyness where I might cutely freeze then remember what I was gonna say a second later and eventually open up and be my goofy self. I never open up. I agree with everything others say and only respond if I'm spoken to. BUT THE VOICE IS THE MOST ANNOYING PART! I HATE IT SO MUCH! Last year, I was actually on the path to overcoming my anxiety. Right before COVID started, that completely flung me backwards. I had a few interactions with people (in class, ordering food) WITHOUT THE VOICE. IT WAS A MIRACLE. I felt so much less anxious to the point the shy voice didn't take over. But then after COVID, it got 100x worse. It comes without me controlling it. I literally open my mouth and if I'm speaking to someone I'm uncomfortable around, it happens. Then as soon as I get home, it's gone. I can't even mimic the voice when I'm by myself or w/ family. it only happens when I go outside and talk to people. This is the weirdest shit ever, anyone relate??"
bpk9m3, I wish people understood what goes on in my head.. My boyfriend an his friends are gonna hang out an he invited me to go hangout with them while they skate together. My bf doesn’t get it at all he doesn’t understand why I can’t just open up an talk to people like I’ve known them for years. An I try to explain but he just doesn’t get it. He doesn’t get all the thoughts that run through my head so fast I can barely keep up it gets overwhelming. I just don’t know how to explain it in a way for him to understand how it is in my head. Anyone else feel this way? 
fn3sg08, Yes when I ride my bike but I end up realizing that I'm not that important and they'll forget about me within two minutes of seeing me. 
fp18hyb,"Mine stems from three things; my weight, genetics, and friends always leaving me. Genetics because my dad suffers from social anxiety and while his is not as severe as mine, I was unfortunate enough to inherit it. My weight is, I think, the main reason why I'm socially anxious. I've always been fat, since I was seven years old. I'm not morbidly obese, but still fat enough to keep me from going outside where people can see me. My body is something I can't hide or pretend I don't have, so the constant reminder that people can see how fat I am makes me extremely anxious. I know everyone thinks ""Oh, she's fat"" as the first thing that comes to mind whenever they see me. I fucking hate that. Also, since I was a child, I was never good at maintaining relationships with others. I used to have ""friends"" for short periods of time and things would be great until something happened to separate us. For example, when I was a kid I had three girls that I considered to be my best friends. Our parents were coworkers and friends, so we would go to each other's houses often. However, when my parents stopped being friends with their parents, they stopped talking to me. Things like that would happen often, I'd finally make friends, then bam, I had to change schools or move countries or people would stop talking to me. This made be unable to make friends as a teenager and adult. The last friend I had was in 2016 and it was this girl I really liked. I was even considering taking her to prom. But one day she just simply stopped talking to me. She said she couldn't hang out with me at school because she got a job at the school's library during lunch but I knew she lied because I always hung out at the library and never once saw her there. I never asked her what happened or what I did to make her leave, but that experience scarred me for life and gave one hell of a depression. Since then, I pretty much became a misanthrope and haven't had any friends at all. I just gave up, which in turn has worsened my SA to the point where I don't know how to talk to people or even have a job."
4jnxbv, How to exercise with SA. I tried going to the gym today. I signed up for a membership and everything. But the gym was super crowded and all the stuff I needed for my routine was being used. When I stood around waiting I felt like everyone was staring at me and giving me weird looks so I left and canceled my membership Are there gyms for people with SA? Is there a place I can get cheap workout equipment? All I really need is an barbell a set of weights and a bench to that I can bench press on. But those three things came out to over 500 dollars which is money I don't have to spend. 
fvrxcd3,"It's tough for sure. I've found a couple things that make it easier for me. If it's going to be a sober date make it something outside, go for a mellow hike/walk, mini golf/go carts, etc. Being outside seems to put me at ease a bit since theres the distraction of the activity vs sitting across a table face to face talking. Plus it makes it more fun anyways. Otherwise alcohol helps, theres a reason why most first dates for people over 21 involve booze. Dating is a bit scary for everyone."
f7p3lb3," I feel like you need to let go off the memories that started all of this, or accept that it's the past and it's time to move on. That's just what I believe, idk.I'm struggling as well but I also think abt the shit that caused my SA, everytime I go outside and interact with new people. "
g2wj0tt,"First of all I want to say that your story is valid and I as a person who was diagnosed with SA relate to most of the things that you said. I was always a shy person and everybody new it. All my life I was that girl who doesn't really talk. I don't think there is one situation that made me like that. I just feel like I was always like that but each year it's been getting worse. In elementary school I had to do a lot of presentations. I was a punching bag for teachers. They really hated that I was talking quietly, not participating and just wanted to make me feel bad about myself, like I was less than everyone else.I was forced to talk till I cried uncountable times. I started to self harm because the pressure was just too much to handle. The only thing that helped me during that time were my friends. I was friendly almost with everyone at my class because I have known them for the whole 9+ years. They knew how scared I was and they accepted me and they were the only reason why I didn't hate going there. I could be myself only with some of them. One of the teachers thought I was just faking anxiety because I act like a different person when I'm with people I trust. That hurt me so much because I don't fake it! I'm just scared of you judging me and making fun of me. Then I started High School which was a nightmare. I wasn't used to meeting new people. I was with the same ones for my whole life and these people didn't know about my problems. I was so scared that I developed an eating disorder and my self esteem is so low. I'm starting my last year in a few days and I know that I'll get bad again. My health has been so great most of the times I was in quarantine. I didn't have to see anyone, go anywhere, life just stopped and I was so relieved. I don't have any friends at school. Whenever someone tried to speak to me I either froze or I just talked about basic stuff because I don't trust anyone enough to tell him my actual thoughts or opinions. I do try to challenge myself once in a while but there is just so much that I still can't do. I was able to go to two concerts by myself (which ended up being the best times of my life), I can shop in a specific supermarket by myself, I can take a bus or train, I was able to get a summer job last year which I never thought I could do. But I can't drive a car, bike, go literally anywhere new just like that. I'm scared of getting a different job, I don't hang out with anyone because I'm scared of judgement. I don't have life experiences like people around me do. I just feel like a failure and a lot of the times I feel like I shouldn't be alive. I'm sorry this was long but who cares right? I'm lonely and I don't have anyone to talk to about this. Take care"
hdeom2," I just want to stop struggling. I want to stop feeling defective. I am so tired.. This is a plea for help. For a long time I've felt like I wasn't cut out for this world. I've always seen the bigger picture, seen how often futile life seems. As early as freshman year of high school I knew that I wouldn't enjoy a life of working for a cold corporation for their benefit and barely getting anything for myself for 40+ years. I knew that college wasn't going to fix my suffering, that it was only a band-aid. I haven't worked since high school, and my last job I quit after the first day due to overwhelming anxiety. I'm 22 and didn't complete college, I have about half the credits for a B.S. I'm contemplating returning this fall, but so many things are weighing on me right now that I feel like I can't breathe. First and foremost is that I am terrified of working. My anxiety is so intense and so ever-present that the mere thought of even submitting an application makes me feel intense fear and dread. Every day, my family interrogates and harasses me about why I am not working. My family are not open-minded about emotions, in fact growing up emotions were barely ever discussed. Mental health may as well not exist. I can't explain to them why my social anxiety is so terrible and so exhausting that walking into a store and applying for a job is not feasible. **They don't understand. I am alone every day with my dark thoughts, trapped inside with them.** I constantly feel like a failure and that I can't show my face. The only thing I enjoy anymore is biking, swimming, walking and reading outside in nature. My other siblings, including my 16 year old brother, work decent hours without a problem and are on the path to success. They can also drive. I don't even have a driver's permit. I am horrified of driving, the anxiety is too much. I don't know if I'll ever be able to drive on a highway, or pass a driving test. The funny thing is that the permit test is on a computer and I feel comfortable on computers and know that I'm intelligent enough to get a permit considering the types of people that drive. **But I am too scared to go take the permit test.** My siblings and I were expected to succeed no matter what. Always pressured into getting high grades, to go to college, to do everything right. Guess what? I didn't. I did well academically in high school, but my anxiety started to crush me (questions about my future career) and led to me no longer attending college. Now all of my old friends graduated this month with their Bachelor's and I'm ashamed of myself. Despite not talking to any of my friends anymore, I'm embarrassed and feel I'll never be able to reconnect with them now. I feel like I have failed in life and I don't see any hope of ever catching up to my peers. I am 22 and it seems too late to pick up the pieces. My family members would never admit it, but I know they despise me. They bully me and put me down constantly, telling me to just ""get a job."" Now, the latest development is that my mother wants to move to a smaller apartment and throw me to the wolves. She has threatened that I won't be able to come with her and my siblings if I don't have a job in a matter of weeks. I am absolutely terrified right now and have never felt more acute anxiety. I have lived in a cocoon of sorts for a while, and I have tried taking baby steps, but I am not prepared for this. I can't survive on my own yet. **I don't know what I am going to do.** I am completely stuck in the mud right now and lost. I need serious, life-saving advice. I don't even know where to begin looking for a job that might be friendly to socially anxious people. I just emailed my library, which is one of the places I love, about possible opportunities for part-time. I could function there, in that type of quiet and slow environment. I can't work in retail or a restaurant. But I fear it is too little, too late. I am so scared guys. **TLDR;** No license, no job, no car, no independence. Terrified of applying for a job and actually working somewhere for 20 hours+ a week. Family preparing to move and will not include me. I am not ready. I am aimless and have nobody to ground me, nobody to help me get my bearings. Thank you if you read this. Any advice that a kind soul can provide will be greatly appreciated. "
fnog5na," You may feel safer and i used to wear my earbuds like an accessory but it's best to just listen to the people around you unless you're at the gym or going for a run go for it but anywhere you can talk to people take them off, listen, and observe. "
qbsbbh," Hype me up to go to a social outing next week. So I’m in college, this group here is organizing a rock climbing adventure next week with the schools mountaineering club and I’ve always wanted to do outside rock climbing. It seems like it’ll be a lot of fun. However the thought of going to the meeting to sign up and learn more about it tomorrow and more than potentially have to travel in a car to and back from the event and interact with people there is making me anxious. I don’t wanna come off weird or shy. I just wanna relax and have fun and possibly make some friends and memories. I also last week had what in my head was a bad interaction with a guy in my class. He’s really cute and we were paired as partners and while he was being really nice and talkative I was being really shy and awkward. I tried to complement his pen collection and all I could say was “those are a lot of pens” ughsibsbsjsbs. I wish I could be this smooth and confident person. I used to be really confident but I’m not sure where it’s all gone. Anyways hype me up on why I should take a chance and go on this rock climbing trip with people I don’t know! Scary vibes but I want to push myself &amp; practice my social skills "
efjzeei," Yeah I’m gonna try going in the store. I just tell myself “what’s the worst that could happen?” The thing that’s hard for me is this feeling of “man they’ll think I’m a total dork who knows nothing about guitars.” Like, I would have less of an issue buying a Porsche (if I had that kind of money), because I wouldn’t feel like an idiot since cars are something I know. I would feel the same if I decided I wanted to start playing baseball and I had to go pick out gear. "
g4fc48u," thank you, i only do it since recently because i figured i needed to have an activity. i go for a bike now when i feel too stressed, not sure it works but i like it enough. it also helps with my fears of cars, roads and all that. maybe it’ll help me get my driving license and feel more at ease. what kind of dog do you have? do you have hobbies? "
dkz9q0x," Thank you for the advice, that's awesome! I'm glad your wedding ended up being a positive, memorable experience for your and your husband. &lt;3 I like the idea of reading your vows to each other in private. It just seems way too personal to be reading aloud to a bunch of other people. As for the destination wedding, thank you for informing me about issues outside the country, I never thought about that. Luckily, we have a friend who's a priest who said he'd be willing to marry us, and he's going to be in Oregon in April. I live in Texas, and have always wanted to visit up North and see the mountains, so this seems like a wonderful opportunity! :D "
einxhoj," Yeah hats make me more anxious because I'm standing out more than I would without one. Sunglasses indoors is the same but if it's appropriate (outdoors) I feel more comfortable wearing them to hide my eye contact. And in public I always end up just wearing a plain un-branded t-shirt with plain jeans not too tight or too baggy and I'd never roll them up, too trendy. "
dm4khog," It's hard isn't it? You want to ease into these situations, have people understand that you're scared and understand why. When people are scared of swimming, they ease into it gently, tip-toe into the water and then the next day they can go a little further. Exposing yourself to social situations is like being expected to jump into the middle of the ocean when you're afraid of swimming. It's not easy to find a way of doing so at your own pace. The 'I just want to run' is so typical of that feeling when you feel trapped by a social situation. If the other person has no concept of social anxiety or they don't realise that that's what you're suffering from they draw all kinds of other conclusions about you from your behaviour and treat you accordingly. It's a shame that there's so little compassion or understanding of it. I don't blame them though, if it's something they've never suffered from before then it must be hard to even begin to imagine the daily impact it has on the sufferer. There are ways around it though. You can practise mindfulness/meditation in a secluded environment, you can exercise more to burn off that extra energy and frustration. Treat every social situation like a learning experience, pick one thing you would do differently next time, even if it's still awkward as hell the next time. For example today, I was trying to have a conversation with someone and I kept saying the wrong words repeatedly and stuttered to the point where she couldn't understand me. She reacted by frowning and saying 'what? excuse me?' What I took away from it was: next time I'm going to speak a little bit slower so I have time to process my words a bit easier. I really hope this helps. Feel free to message me anytime if you need to chat and vent about this more. "
5eznmq," My SA has improved in the past year so I'll write a little about that. Someone on another thread a few weeks ago asked me now I'm dealing better with SA and this is basically what I wrote, changed up a little. I wanted to repost it, in the hopes it'll help just a little. **How I was**: When I was 16-18 I had a string of bad experiences that brought my self esteem down to where it didn't even exist. The worst of those experiences was becoming a camp leader, none of the other leaders liked me and I was too quiet and I was told not to come back after that. Every day was traumatic and I had flashbacks about it for like 2 years, I was extremely ashamed. After that, the words, ""socialise"", ""mix"", ""integrate"" just struck fear into me. Starting college reminded me a lot of that. I was so anxious that my brain would literally empty. I was putting a lot of pressure on myself to have really great friends and for people to like me. In college you're ""meant"" to get along with everyone because you're ""meant"" to peak, basically. So I talked to a lot of people, awkwardly, but forced myself. It didn't work, my self esteem was non-existent, I hated myself and no one else particularly liked me either. I became bitter and didn't like other people. I didn't realize I was bitter though? Being an outsider I found myself starting to notice people's flaws more because I didn't understand why they were better than me. Every social interaction I had basically left me feeling criiiiinge afterwards, even if nothing bad happened. Then I did work placement and I actually made some friends. This is when I realized that maybe the problem isn't as much me and I thought it was. After finishing college I experienced a release and I realized I actually *like* being alone to a certain extent, and I don't care what people think of that. Not caring what people think of me has changed my perspective, and has allowed me to strive for actual pleasant encounters, rather than for me wanting to come across as an awesome social butterfly. **Things I have realized recently that have helped:** 1. I'm judging people. Which is why I think people are judging me. Stop judging people. 2. Don't allow yourself to cringe or beat yourself up. You are your best friend. If a social interaction doesn't go well, recognize it and let it go. At most, if you do cringe and feel like crap when something bad happens, try and recognize your thoughts are irrational and let it go. I started a new job, my first real job, and it's super social. I have such bad imposter syndrome but I'm keeping my head above water. My bf's mother works in a cleaning position, one day I ate lunch by myself (the people I sorta knew were at a full table, but btw it would have been a big step for me to sit with them anyway), and she asked me if I was isolating myself. I felt really embarrassed and annoyed at her and I actually cried a little in the bathroom because I realized I must look like an idiot. Then later I realized I'm getting upset over something which in the grand scheme of things, means nothing! No one died. She was only concerned about me. If I looked like a fool, I can change that by talking to people the next day. If you do something embarrassing that doesn't mean people are gonna think you're an idiot forever and ever and ever. Stop beating yourself up, if you're going to have a meltdown about an awkward or embarrassing situation, keep it brief and make sure you let it go. By let it go, I don't mean ignore it, try and put it into perspective and realize it's no big deal. **Helpful stuff**: 1. /r/howtonotgiveafuck. There's some good videos there. Giving a fuck what people think is a huge part of SA. You're not going to become extroverted and confident over night with this. But it will help you shrug things off and be happy regardless of what people think or say about you. I find that not giving a fuck is about having the confidence to talk to someone after you embarrass yourself in front of them, to continue to be yourself regardless of what people think. IMO, it's not convincing yourself people didn't notice, which is advice I always see and hear. I'm not talking about being super chatty and fun, it can just be chatting about nothing, which is also a good thing to practice. 2. Also, a little exercise to try that helped me, is telling yourself your nerves are actually excitement. And don't sit there hoping someone won't talk to you, say to yourself ""I want to talk to this person"", it won't always help you approach people but it will stop you from giving out a ""don't talk to me"" vibe, and will make it easier if someone talks to you. 3. Smile more. Think about something that makes you happy and smile. Not fake smile, real smile. 4. LISTEN. Do not think about what you're going to respond. Just listen to people. You'll have less time to think of a response, but it'll be a more genuine one. **How I'm doing now** I'm still quiet and anxious. But I'm not as quiet as I used to be, I don't hate myself for a new reason each day. My confidence is massively improving, I have 2 friends at work, one of whom I actually talked to first! Yay! I smiled at my neighbour today. I talked to a man while our dogs sniffed each others butts. I don't feel like slapping myself after these things either, I actually feel happy. It's baby steps. It took a long time for me to have these realizations. I would say, push yourself outside your comfort zone, but don't pressure yourself too much or be hard on yourself. And know people's opinions of you don't mean anything I was with my boyfriends friends and they were playing loud music and driving quite fast through the mountains. I was extremely anxious, I get sensory overload a lot. And then I said to myself ""this is exciting"" and just let go. And that kind of helped me make the leap to do more scary things without it making me feel worse. I kept thinking about that quote from the Princess Diaries, ""The brave may not live forever but the cautious do not live at all"". I know this advice may be unhelpful to some people. I know it's easier said than done. Also, if you can, get a dog. "
eh9qn3j, I feel very at peace in the rockie mountains and at a sunset over a calm beach. I love the sounds and smells of the ocean 
r78yet, Going outside today reminded me that I’ll never be able to live a normal life. I wasn’t even that nervous before I went out I just felt bad but once I was around other people I just genuinely wanted to die because I knew this would never get easier. No matter for how many years I am around people it doesn’t get better. It feels like there’s no point in even trying because I know I will never actually become like everyone else. I will keep struggling my entire life 
e7ol8xk,"Im 16 and as I live in the countryside I started jogging around the roads, nobody knows me so it is fine. I also do push-ups amd abs before taking a shower. "
7bi8d5," I snapped and it paid off.. Kinda silly story, but please no hate. My family and I moved to a different state. I don't have many friends because of SA, and it always played a burden on my relationships with people. 5 months later, and i have yet to make any friends, have yet to find a job, and have a non-existant social life. I was deathly afraid of meeting someone new, and anytine i tried, my brain kept screaming at me to get out of there. The friends I have are thousands of miles away, and I just felt so lonely. It took me 21 years to build myself up whilst struggling with SA. Last night, I woke up crying, shaking, muscles twitching and gasping for air. I was not happy with my lonely life, I felt like there was no way out. I stared at my wall for an hour, wiped my tears and grabbed my phone. I couldnt take it anymore. So then I downloaded tinder (of all apps to open) swiped right on every single profile until I got a match. Not the safest decisions but I asked this person to grab some coffee. Turns out this stranger was a nice person. And I guess I finally made a friend. I guess it wasn't so bad. I'm taking this experience and I'm gonna run with it. Edit: Thank you for the praise everyone, i teared up reading them. It really was nerve wracking but I paced myself and reminded myself to breathe. Of course afterwards, I went to an empty park and sang my favorite songs by the river to celebrate "
g2rd3ci," It’s normal to fell creeped out by a old man who you don’t know, considering he cat called you. Just keep taking small steps, maybe tomorrow when you go for a walk, you will fill less anxious "
esfab0g," Just stay as calm as you can when you’re there, breathe and take a walk on lunch. You probably won’t make friends the first few days but they’ll come! "
daxtozo," Any recommendations on upcoming judgement free events in the bay? Also have had social anxiety pretty much all my life and live like 2 hours away from SF, and have found a couple of really awesome raves by lurking on /r/aves long enough to find events near. To OP, I would recommend just finding an event and going, and maybe alcohol too that helps haha. But yea, that's pretty much what I did and ended up having a really awesome time. I too was feeling that feeling of wanting to experience the magic of a rave while also being super nervous about it due to my SA. Definitely glad I ended up going, as a music lover it really was as magical as I imagined it would be "
dot7q7x,"I noticed that there are certain type of people who make me feel comfortable immediately and I’m not sure how to describe them well, but they’re like really warm people? They’re like these old ladies who live in a small red cabin with only their 10 cats and who bake cookies to their grandchildren every weekend. They can be any age though, but met only a few younger people that I get this feeling from and the other one of them is my friend. It just feels easy to be around them."
jql0pl,"I’m never leaving home again. First of all sorry if my English isn’t perfect, it’s not my first language, but onto what happened. Yesterday I got invited to my first *party*. It wasn’t even a party, it was a small gathering of less than 10 people, which is permitted in my country. Anyways I (17M) was so nervous when my friend asked me to come over. At first I didn’t want to but since there weren’t many people there and I knew most of them from school I decided fuck it, I will give it a try. The whole way there I was literally shaking while driving my motorcycle because of my anxiety. The place is very isolated and I had never been there so he texted me the position. Now I didn’t know if they were trolling me but when I arrived finally at the place, which took me way longer than it should have since it was so hard to find, I found a home with no lights on. I started to text my friend asking him to come out, and he didn’t respond, so I decided to call him even if I despise phone calls. I called him about 15 times and he never picked up. After a while a man came out and he was approaching me, I could barely speak because of how embarrassed I was but I managed to somehow explain to him that I was at the wrong house. Finally my friend responded to me and told me I was at the wrong place, even though I was exactly at the place where he shared the location. He texted me a NEW location which was wrong again, same scene as before. Then he texted me what I think was the real location (it matched his description of the house), and at this point my shitty’s iPhone 6s battery gives up and decides to die on me. At this point I started to cry. It’s a bit embarrassing but at this point I had been driving for over 2 hours in the cold (it was 9pm), had knocked on 2 stranger’s door and I didn’t have any way of reaching my friend now. I cried all the way back home and I had to explain to my mom what had happened when I got home. I just feel that every time I try to get out of my shell I feel like shit since I don’t know how to behave around people. I think I decided now I’m never going outside and meeting people again. I won’t have friends but there are other things to life: I got my music, my video games, series, movies, pornography, etc... Changing schools last year was my final attempt at having a social life and it hasn’t worked out and I honestly don’t know why I should keep trying when it makes me feel like absolute shit and I keep failing. So I guess I give up."
cyxpf4u," I was like that for the longest time. People say it's just an effect of being depressed, but I don't think that was it, at least not for me. I spent most of my childhood in survival mode due to my social anxiety, and just escaped into video games whenever I could (my version of your TV?). I think spending all that time in survival mode prevented me from enjoying things the same way other people did, and prevented me from exploring new things and developing strong interests. Eventually I got really into survivalism, bushcraft, norse paganism, primitive camping, primitive archery, and things like that. I probably should've guessed it earlier, since I've always liked nature. I just never really checked what kinds of hobbies and views were available for that, so previously I never built up my interest in nature to its full potential. You might have a different interest that you've always sort of ignored. If you have any guilty pleasures or anything that unexpectedly appealed to you in the past, explore those and see if you can find something that fits you. "
elz47n6," Yup. Walking outside is embarrassing. It's upsetting cause while all my friends look forward to going to the spa, get nails done ect. I feel embarrassed to get my hair done "
nkk61x," Does anyone just imagine all these possible awkward social situations that might happen and get irrationally anxious about them??. I’m lying awake in bed thinking about a road trip (for work) I’m taking with a couple coworkers. I don’t really know them well and I’m not that comfortable around guys (I’m a woman). I’m so anxious about dumb shit. Like what if we go eat at a restaurant and one of them goes to the bathroom? What am I going to talk to the one sitting at the table about? What if there’s awkward silence? I hate awkward silences, they make my heart race! What if I have to sit right next to one of them on the plane? There will be pressure to talk the entire time! I might want to sleep but I’ll feel awkward. What if we eat something shady and I get sick or have gas? What if we want to do something athletic? I’m not athletic and they’re both grown men! I can imagine they might want to go kayaking and I’m going to be so awful. I also can’t really ride a bike in a straight line (I have a minor physical disability that no one really knows about) but my friends always make fun of me for the way I ride a bike. And eating at the house we’re staying at! Do we all have to eat every meal together? Am I going to make my own food? Do we all have to cook in the kitchen together? If I try to just cook at night will I be viewed as anti social? I’m worried I’m going to get socially exhausted and withdraw completely. Also one guy isn’t flying back with us so I’ll have to go to the airport with just one of the guys on the way back so we’re going to have to make conversation. Having to make conversation gives me anxiety. Also usually at the airport I buy candy and eat it or just kind of watch dumb shit on YouTube but I want to appear super mature around my coworkers and make a good impression. What if he wants to eat at the airport? I feel awkward eating with guys especially if I don’t know them well. Gah this is such an exciting trip and a good career move for me but the social aspect of it all is making me so incredibly anxious. Okay I think those are my major anxieties. "
fpfl5u2," Nah it has gone beyond that, now I just feel immense anxiety being outside and sometimes I can feel myself almost starting to cry for literally no reason... "
ky9iam,"My social anxiety. I have bad social anxiety, but how can I address it? I saw several therapists, one said I have it, the other suggested meds and exposure, but later dropped it. I don't have any friends, just acquaintances every now and then. I tend to offend people I feel like too. Never had a girlfriend, too unconfident/kinda lonely to put effort. I get nervous around people because I feel like they'll see me as awkward, or like a guy that doesn't socialize, or whatever, and I don't want them to feel uncomfortable. I get really nervous before meeting someone, or before talking about something but I do fine in the meeting. Once I went around complimenting people, it was received well, though I may have come on too strong for some people. Started feeling unconfident later since people were out with friends/family and I felt lonely and I didn't have anyone, but didn't want anyone to know, since if they knew they would get close to me and find out who I really am, just a lonely person who doesn't hang with people and doesn't do that many interesting things but likes to think and write, listen to music, read self-improvement. I am interesting, just not socially. I lived in a house with 5 others I didn't know and I forced myself. I was too scared to go downstairs so I would spend an hour or two distracting myself before I was like ok, you're going to go downstairs and no matter what they think just know what you're doing. I was overthinking things like oh if I go down and cook something, what if they are in the kitchen and I have to not make it uncomfortable otherwise they would feel pressured to let me cook. Or if I bring food down, they're going to judge me for eating the same thing, or wonder why I have it in my room. Also I had a table there and I was worried they would judge where I put it, or take it apart, or judge me when I eat, and I would rather eat in my room, but I was worried they would see me take it up and judge me for being weird, or then start bothering me. Or I was worried we would small talk and I would have to tell them I wasn't doing anything except just reading, thinking, working a bit, etc. To not seem like I was in the house for too long, I would go outside and just take walks and sit outside for hours. When I got back I would hope noone ask me where I was, since I wasn't anywhere. I didn't want them to think I was alone all the time. I got through almost 2 months of this. I also got a position as a resident assistant on campus and it bothers me a lot, since I don't want to be seen as awkward, scared, or have people realize that I actually couldn't support them socially since I struggle more there. I do send the info out but it feels really contrived, since I don't want to be seen in more detail. I also don't want to put that I want to meet them because I don't think I can handle that. One time I force myself to greet everyone I met in the hall but I felt like it made some uncomfortable or it came out wrong. One time I met one in the bathroom and I forced myself to ask him questions but I feel like it came too strong. And it was awkward too but I felt like he, who's couple years younger, was the one trying to compliment me since he said I got a nice haircut. I had wanted to quit and did tell my supervisor, but then I figured if I do just the requirements it's ok...but then I do feel like my residents can be kind of annoyed, or see me as a boring person who can't make things exciting for them (since I struggled myself throughout) like other people. I do try to let them know some of the events but I feel like they can tell I don't care. I don't think they are oblivious to the fact that I avoid letting myself be known more and stay in my room. I just hope they think it's cuz I'm busy, not interested, rather than cuz I'm scared, I am a couple years older than most of them. Tired of being different. So yeah, I've got along fine, I guess."

98k9kp," College isn't worth it (for most; no that's not an insult). Yeah this user shares in the cringe and boiled-blood when that expression is used, like it's a put-down. But this user means after dropping out years ago after 4 years in it, two at one garbage excuse and two at another, it's almost all the same. There's little to no difference between states, colleges, restaurants, courses, teachers (not calling 'em professors, most are NOT worthy of the title....few are). It's not that there's such a thing as a good state (as an AnCap-minded INDIVIDUAL there's not really such a thing...holding out hope for Liberland and BF-proposed floating cities though, make an AnCapistan a reality somewhere) but that they all suck, to varying degrees, with some just not quite as suck-y as others (NH is among the least disliked). One still has to go through some level of further indoctrination that virtually everything is assault and not to put something in one's own nutrition (although alcohol does close the third-eye and feed the parasites, not a prude, just be irresponsible responsibly and don't force one's own shtty beliefs on others) just to begin entering said concentration camp with AlkyEDU and Havn modules. There's still an inordinate and unnecessary amount of jackbooted thugs roaming around on patrols and sentries looking for any excuse to harass and document/record one's own information and features into systems private people trying to live their lives as anonymously as possible (at least until dream careers work out, then being a celebrity is welcome as long as it's voluntary self-doxxing, but don't push someone on the street into a spotlight without their permission; this goes to wannabe-reporters/projects with pukes on bikes with go-pros asking loaded questions!). Can't go to the local excuse of a club/bar to work on social-ineptness/anxiety/social-skills without having a squad van that shouldn't exist in face with unconstitutional dash and bodycams on people when there's ALREADY PRIVATE SECURITY in the form of bouncers this user has no problem with (people can handle themselves!). SHOPPING (generally) SUUUUX and after gaining the 'freshman 15' one is gonna lose 30 pounds the next 4 years after that, and is probably the main difference between any and all places, what poison-sellling little-shop-of-horrors there is to be frequented by electricity-and-warmth-producing machines for hyper-dimensional forces. Almost everyone is a wuss, insert own 'culturual-appropriation-story' here and encounters with outraged 'liberals' (not liberal) and reactionary 'conservative' (not conservative) agitators clashing when they're all leftists (stupid labels; one collectivist vs. another collectivist vs. another collectivist vs. another collectivist, old and new, classical and progressive, no matter, all authoritarian and un-libertarian). No one really 'parties' anymore, at least good parties one will likely be invited to somewhere. There's no 'naked miles', to this user's chagrin for years (wanted it to be like the movies). DON'T.TAKE.OUT.LOANS.OF.ANY.KIND! No mortgages (dethcontracts), no cars or houses one does not truly OWN, NO APARTMENT LIFE (IT SUUUUUUUUUXXX; nothing but a thumping, noise, screaming, barking, laughing, puking, stomping, knocking, slamming, shifting, SMELLING, INFESTED experience, DORMS are probably worse and smaller)! Stay at home, live with parents/friends/guardians/airBnB/homeless shelter and Uber/Lyft/WALK/BUS everything until one makes enough money to GET OUT. GET OUT. GET OUT! GET THE PHUGGOUDDAHHERE!!! Before the coming collapse! Decentralize all teh tings! Listen to podcasts, READ BOOKS, watch YT/Minds/DTube/Btchute videos, WRITE STEEMIT ARTICLES for money, DO SOMETHING that makes yuh happy (mainly), a lot of money, and changes the world for the better! Don't fall into a 9-to-5, monitored, harassed, sleepless, starving, boring, unhappy, poor, poisonous, toxic, lifestyle of broken dreams! Find a counselor or sub to talk to/rant on and use whatever cognitive dissonance for coping one can to allow one's self to do so until fully healed! Don't succumb to the 'matrix' and contemplate, let alone go through with, 'cidal thoughts! Unless one has some sort of GUARANTEED (not much of such a thing, really) shot at some sports team, letterman/scholarship'ed experience and/or degree that WILL be needed/help with one's career, ONLY THEN, at one's own volition (this experience isn't one-size-fits-all), feel free to go for it, go to college, but only if yuh WANT to. Listen to one's own heart and plan things out. Narrow things down and make an educated guess and run with it! Peace.Luv.AndANARCHY! "
fa762l,"i dont even recognize myself anymore. i used to be extremely outgoing and social. in high school i remember thinking how people who needed alcohol to have fun were so weird and boring...and then i started drinking a lot and became the kind of person who needed alcohol to be social or talk to people i didn't know. for the past year, i haven't worked and have barely left my house. i live with my boyfriend and a couple months ago we moved to rural north dakota and i know nobody. tonight i went to a cookout with my boyfriend and his coworkers and their wives (all people i have never met before). i decided not to drink all of 2020, so i didn't have any liquid confidence. i thought smoking might help so i brought my wax pen, but im not sure if it just made me paranoid or not. either way, the whole time i was there, i felt like i was going to throw up. people tried talking to me and i just had like one word answers and couldn't think of anything else to talk about. and i can never look people in the eye. i ended up having my boyfriend drive me home way early and it was so awkward leaving, and i could tell everyone was going to talk about me when i left because i was being totally fucking strange. after being isolated for so long, i have lost all ability to socialize. i cant even go to the grocery store by myself and i dont speak to anyone in person besides my boyfriend. how do i regain social skills?!"
fv8r8j,"I wish growing up... I wish I was encouraged by my parents. I wish I was encouraged to explore who I was as a child and explore different activities that would have socialized me at a young age like most children who develop normally do. I wish I was close to my extended family. For some reason, my parents were never really close to theirs. We got together from time to time but never enough to develop an even semi-close relationship. I wish I was a Girl Scout. Seriously, at a young age, I always wanted to be a Girl Scout. I heard they do so many great things to help girls development. Community service, camping and bonfires, etc. I wish I was able to join the soccer team in high school. I would’ve made it if my GPA wasn’t so bad for missing so much school. The high school coach was my same soccer coach from middle school (the first and last school sports team I had ever joined) and he asked me if anything was wrong. I wish I went to school more. Sure, I graduated high school on time, but I didn’t truly enjoy the high school experience because I missed so much especially during junior and senior years. I isolated myself because I felt abnormal even though I masked it pretty well when I went to school. I was actually “popular” for a while, but that faded because I stopped going to school as much. I didn’t want anyone to see the state I was in. I felt like a fraud because I was. I was faking this confident persona when I actually have so many self esteem issues. I’ve never seen myself as good enough. I wish my parents were more involved. Both have always, for the most part, been in their own worlds. They don’t know what it takes to raise children in a developmentally healthy way. They’re unhealthy and unstable people themselves.. so what more could I expect? Most people aren’t completely healthy &amp; stable though, but I guess both of them were just off the rails. At the same time, if they were as bad as I say they were, maybe I wouldn’t have the self-awareness to recognize what’s happening and have the desire to change my path. I was just accepted to a university from a community college. So I’m officially a junior now. I have 2 years left of school. I want to make the most of it.. I thought about joining a sorority because it really does sound like a girls scout for young women. they do events, community service, have fun together.. I just want a solid group of girl friends.. I miss having friends. Having people :( I’m sad. I want to feel enough. I feel sad looking back at life and not having enough memories to look back on. Not having enough social interaction because I isolated myself for so long and I received little to no encouragement from my parents because they were social recluses themselves.. Sorry. I just wanted to share my thoughts. Please feel free to share yours too. I’m a good listener."
d58krmu,"I know exactly how you feel. I have always been skinny and could never gain weight. However, I decided last year that I was going to get out of my comfort zone and hit the gym. Hitting the gym is not only hard for SA people, any skinny guy feels insecure in gym with your typical big tough guys. However, with small steps, I was able to feel at home at the gym while being that skinny guy.nnYou need to start small. I was lucky enough to be able to go with a friend at first. He wasn't really into the lifting culture, we actually had to go once per week to the gym in addition to our school's gym class. We had to go to the school's gym, so it was very nerve racking to work out in front of people that I see everyday. However, my gym class was called ""Back to fitness"", so the first time I stepped in the school gym it was with my class. We were given a great tour and explained how every machine works. We were also given routine examples and a list of exercises recommended. nnI was really afraid of other's opinions, so I always wore jogging pants and long sleeved shirts, so that they wouldn't see my tiny arms, but the thing is that I did go to the gym. At first, I would just do a lot of running(40 minutes) and then go to the free weights for 10 minutes, as I was afraid of doing exercises wrong. nnWhen the school year ended(2 months ago), I wasn't packed with huge muscles. I only went to the gym for 3 months 2 times per week and didn't have a real routine nor appropriate nutrition and wasn't trying very hard. However, I realized that I had a lot of time ahead of me in the summer and that I had to turn my life around. I was fucking tired of having SA(which also gave me depression) so I decided to hit the gym outside of school. But where was I going to go? There are about 15 gym for me to chose, which one was it going to be? nnI decided to go with the equivalent of Planet Fitness where I live. Why? Because the customers are known to either be poor or old. I knew that I was going to feel safe working out in front of older people. But before making my decision, I went scouting the area every day, at different times to see when it was the least busy. That happened to be 10PM, 1 hour before it closed. I spent about 2 weeks doing research on exercises and a good routine before feeling confident enough to actually go. nnHere we are, 2 weeks later at 10PM. I am sitting outside this place to go buy my membership. As I pay, I notice that the gym is empty. I have all my stuff on me, but I still can't go. I have no idea what I stopping me, but I was just too afraid. I just go back in my car and go home. The next day, I decided that I had to go. So there I go back in my car at the same time and get changed in the gym. I only pulled a cardio workout and scouted the area to see where everything was. After that, I went back home and did a lot of research to understand every machine. nnIt's now been a month since my first time at that gym. No, I didn't notice any changes in my body, but my mind has changed a lot. You have no idea how good I feel in the gym. I get a few nods everytime I walk in. I am still scrawny, but I am not afraid to ask this big guy if he is done with the squat rack. It also cure my depression. I am finally motivated to do everything that I wanted. I wake up happy and motivated.nnNow that I got my story out of the way, I want to give you some tips and advice. Yes, you may feel motivated by my story, but chances are that you will pussy out like me the first time you go, but that's fine! You need to fail here. You need to congratulate yourself for all the small steps you will make. You need to celebrate your first workout and see this as an achievement. Anyways, here goes my tips:nnn* Do some researchnnYes, you need to know what you are doing. Having SA means that you afraid of looking like you are lost. Going to the gym will be a new experience and you will be lost if you don't have a plan of exercises. Bodybuilding.com has helped me a lot.nn* Know what to expectnnYou need to know that everyone will think that you are skinny. They will acknowledge that you are skinny and new to the gym, but that's great! That means that they are expecting you to be lost and using low weights. How perfect is it to do exactly what others are expecting of you! They will also offer help if you have a question about a certain machine.nn* Use low weightsnnYes, you might feel stupid squatting the bar by itself, but so did I when I first squatted. What matters is form, not the weight. No one will laugh at you if aren't curling as much as them. They will laugh at you if you can't even do the exercise properly. nn* No one judges you therennGyms are places of self improvement. Everyone is there to better themselves and have at point been fat or skinny. They know what it feels like to be new. Also, they might not even see you. People are busy working out, they aren't busy looking at who just came in. nn* MusicnnMake that one motivational playlist and blast it your ears, it will make you forget about everything else. nn* Be ready for failurennAs I said, I once just went to the gym and only did cardio. You can just walk in the gym, do one set and leave. Just go. It doesn't matter what you do and how long you stay just as long as you actually do something.nnnnFor anymore help concerning bodybuilding itself, I suggest you look at a lot of videos. They will teach you how to and what to lift. I am only a dude with SA lifting, I am not qualified to teach you how to lift.nnDo not give up. Physical activity gives powers, I mean it. You will feel so good after a session at the gym. You will have energy and be willing to better yourself. Good luck in your journey and feel free to PM me if you need more motivation or tips, I am here to help!nnOh and BTW, don't listen to the people commenting to quit the gym. Do not fucking give up.

hf4z0c,"I dread hanging out with this girl.. I(19M)'m usually not the guy who suffers from anxiety in general (let alone social anxiety), but... The quarantine months have been really tough on me and my family. To start off, my grandparents suffered from a few health problems, and with the whole covid-19 thing going on... well, they haven't been that easy to deal with, and they got me very worried. Secondly, I failed a couple of exams at university for the billionth time, and I now feel pretty damn useless. Lastly, my long-time crush told me she found another boyfriend (tbh, fuck her, I stopped trusting her a long time ago). Now, I still enjoyed hanging out with my friends for the occasional bike ride or group dinner, and I also went to a couple of parties (I had great fun there!). In general, I feel like my social confidence has improved, mostly because of the fact that my acne got somehow better. I talked with soo many random people just to have some fun with them, you wouldn't believe that! But... as a consequence of what I talked about in the first paragraph, I feel very weak and tired: my overall energy levels have never been as low as they are now, and I'm getting less and less productive as the days go by. I refused many invitations from the aforementioned friends because I just couldn't mentally process so much stuff all at once. As for the icing on the cake, well... I asked a girl out a few days ago. Ours is a platonic friendship, but in all honesty I'd really like to take it to the next step. We used to get along really well with each other, to the point where most of our common friends would ship us. Or at least, that's what they used to do before the quarantine, ya know. I haven't met her in a while at this point, and I'm extremely unsure about what will happen. My ""confident self"" thinks that I got this down, that I can try and take this thing to the next level. The other side of me, well... wonders whether she still enjoys my company, if she has found another bf in the meantime and so on... I'm fairly sure that this kind of failure would wreck me for good. I hardly slept the last few nights because of these thoughts alone, while I kept dreaming about our past experiences and conversations. Trust me, it wasn't as enjoyable as it sounds. I'm not even sure why I wrote this post in the first place. I probably just wanted to get it off my chest and hear what you guys think about it, since I haven't told anyone irl yet. Also sorry for my bad English - I'm no native speaker and my concentration is currently floating around the Milky Way. TL;DR - The last few months have been particularly shitty. I want to take a ""friendship"" to the next level, but my recent failures and concerns are driving me insane and holding my confidence back. Any tips to deal with this?"
n3ot8t," Possible social anxiety?. I am not looking to be diagnosed by a complete stranger but I just want an opinion by someone with SAD because I've been really confused. First of all, not only do I get anxious talking to people I don't know well but I often feel anxious around my friends. Anytime my two closest friends ask to facetime I get so so anxious that sometimes I try to find any excuse to get out of calling them (which I always feel bad for) and then when I do facetime with them I get all sweaty and shaky. And it's the same situation for when my friends ask to hangout in person. I think the main reason is beacuse I hate those awkward pauses in a conversation and I feel like most times I have no idea what to talk about. Secondly, my self esteem isn't great. I often catch myself comparing myself to others. It's espscially when I'm at school and it feels like people are staring at me. I'm always worried about how I look and how I act. And if none of my friends are in my class I can't make converstaion with other people which is the worst especially when I have to do group work or group presentations. Like I said before my self esteem is bad which means that I always put myself down. For exemple, if I answer a question wrong in class I say ""I hate myself"" or ""I'm so dumb"" repeatedly in my head. And I find that I dig my nails in my palms in these kind of situation where I'm anxious. No, not even close to point where they bleed like Betty from Riverdale. It's just slightly but still I thought it was important to mention. Lastly, lately I've been feeling really unmotivated and useless. Which is most likely not related to what I think is my social anxiety. I don't have the motivation to exercise, to do homework, to make food, basically anything. And I know it's not healthy physically and mentally and I even feel guilty about doing nothing all day but I just have no motivation to do anything about it. I'm even scared to post this... I feel like even if this is a social anxiety subreddit that maybe people are going to judge me for digging my nails in my palm or for not even wanting to hangout with my closest friends. I don't expect anyone to reply and if you don't want to that's totally fine but if you do thank you so much &lt;3 "
76jhxv," Can someone tell me what is going on? My entire anxiety story.. I'm 23 years old. I was diagnosed with anxiety about a year ago when I was 22. So I want to tell you guys what happened, what medicine I'm on and then I want you guys' advice. I have never had anxiety before. I was the team captain of my football team, I took a public speaking class in college. I was extremely nervous to go out on the field at the beginning of games and when I had speeches, but never encountered this type of anxiety. However, I noticed that I would get a bit shaky when speaking up in class especially if I would drink coffee and not have breakfast. I notice my neck would twitch. So last year, I was gave a history presentation. I had coffee and no breakfast. I stood up in class gave my part of the presentation. During the presentation I got really nervous and just read what I had on my paper instead of actually giving a normal speech. Right after the speech was over I started feeling the blackout feeling kind of like someone has when they get up too fast. Scared that I would pass out, I just walked straight out of the class room. Sure enough right after I made it out of the door and closed it, I passed out. I felt better after passing out. I went back in the classroom. Was my regular self. The teacher fussed me but I told her I was feeling weak and went get some food. I was clowning around with other students after. No anxiety. This was on a wednesday. Fast Forward to Friday. I have school again. Before the history class I have an economics exam. I'm running late to school. Just have the coffee, no breakfast again. Go through with the exam, feel good about it but quite hungry and a little shaky so i buy a candy bar out of the vending machine. I get to history class, people are doing presentations. I'm already done with mine from the previous day and no that I don't have to do anything but something just triggered me. I felt like I was about to pass out again. I put my head down until class is over, I still feel like I'm about to pass out, I'm panicking, so i walk fastly to vending maching and buy another candy, thinking that its my blood sugar or something. I eat it, I get some comfort for a second and start feeling it again, I go to the little store and buy a gatorade scared I could pass out at any minute. Extremely self conscious. I drink it, and head back for my car. As soon as I get to the car, I have my first panic attack, I'm laying down scared I'm having a heart attack. I get through it. I immediately go to the Dr. She thinks it could be something with food, tells me to focus on eating and drinking well over the weekend. I do that, but monday when its time to go back to school, I can't. I'm all panicky thinking that I must be sick. I'm having diarrhea etc. Tuesday I feel great at home. Wednesday when its time to go to school, all panicky having diarrhea again so I go straight back to the dr where she gives me an anxiety test. Sure enough everything on the test I'm thinking wow, this is exactly what I have. So she gives me .5 mg xanax as needed and celexa. I start taking my medicine. Xanax works like a charm. It’s the most relieving thing ever. I feel exactly how I did before I ever had anxiety. I took it only on school days or when I have to get up in front of class. So I take celexa for 4-5 months and it moderately helps. Learning of bad side effects of SSRIs though I decide not to take celexa anymore once my spring semester ends. I go through the summer and summer classes without taking any celexa or Xanax. My anxiety is heightened however, and I have to focus on breathing many times but I did it. I got through the whole summer without either drug. In August, I go to the dr because I have ear problems. She has to clean out my ears (it hurts) and I pass out. I tell her how I quit my meds and after passing out she tells me that I should consider getting back on them. As the fall semester approached, I got nervous and took my dr advice. I got back on the celexa. Man I felt great. Especially after about amonth on celexa. On a scale from 1-10 my anxiety was about 2 at max. 6 weeks into celexa I feel so great that I test my anxiety. On a bus that I was riding I decided that I was going to stand and give a girl my seat….. Bad decision. I begin to feel faint, start wobbling and shaking. I hurry and grab a Xanax as my vision is going black. It instantly saves me. I’m pouring down sweat. When I get to my destination, I try to explain to my gf what happened by my speech is slurred for about 5 min. After this episode my anxiety has been bad ever since. That leaves me to today. I’m on my celexa but my anxiety is very bad. I feel like I want to quit my anxiety meds. I felt great this past summer not being on it. It was challenging but I did it. I graduate in December and start working though and that makes me nervous. I don’t want to have anxiety everyday. I just wish I could go back in time before that history presentation to how I used to be. I’m not depressed, but it’s just extremely annoying how difficult everything is now. What advice do you guys give? Should I opt out of celexa? And just take Xanax as needed with a supplement? Or should I just stay on the celexa? Or should I wait until I start working to quit taking celexa? I have a supplement on hand called ""Genius Joy” It has B vitamins, D Sam-e 1000mg, 5HTP, and other stuff in it. Should I get off my celexa and try that? Comments on the entire situation would also be helpful! Thanks so much guys! "
enrjyon,"For me my home isn't my comfort zone, it's hell. I can't go out at night because i'm 15 and because it is really dangerous here to go out alone at night as a girl. If i go outside at day i feel like there are so many people who are constantly judging me just because i'm alone, i know that it's stupid. I want to go outside and experience social interactions but my social anxiety wants to stay home and sadly i'm not strong enough to fight that yet but i'm working on it. And hearing your story actually gave me a little bit of hope that i'll make it! :)"
q6wc4l," Worst fear has happened. I (22m) was walking behind a couple of women at night on my way home, and I had to assume they were terrified of me.. Background: many of the girls I've been friends with have had either really scary things happen to them or people they know, or have known men that have done shitty things. So the thing I'm most afraid of is being seen as or compared to those men. I've heard many stories about women being terrified of men walking behind them at night, and wondering if that man was going to harm them in some way. So I was out for a walk yesterday, and I didnt realize the sun was already setting when I was about 30 minutes away from home, so the second half of my walk was in the dark. About 10 minutes away from home, these two women turned onto the sidewalk in front of me, and I was walking behind them for a while. I would've changed my route if I could have, but theres really only one way to get back to my apartment from where I was and apparently they were going that way too. So here I am, some random guy these two women didnt know, and were probably terrified of me. I tried not to think about it too much on my way home, but I cant help but think I'm somehow a bad person because of what people have told me about their experiences in the past. I didnt try to talk to them, or interact with them in any way, because I thought that would not be welcome. I'm not going to ask for sympathy or pity or whatever, and I'm not trying to spin this as some ""woe is me, my plight is worse than these women's"", it's just been bothering me and I needed to get it out. Hope y'all have a good rest of your day. "

I have a self destructive behivour I dont even like my self. Im waste of a man, waste of a life. I dont go out anymore or try to make friends cause it will only make me hurt/hate my self again. I have lost interest in makin freinds coz i never get them, The real ones, Im sure i always bore people, having no personality, So how can a girl like me.. I feel like im not good enough. Maybe its truth. I try to impress people to get them to like me or give me attention. I try a lot to make ppl laugh. But nobody likes me. Never got loved. Idk how to stop this. I never been loved or important or been liked by anyone. I get ignored. I feel the need to get a Gf or girls to like me online or to masturbate.

I have no confidence, calmness, strentgh. Im depressed. Insecure. Afraid of ppl leaving me. Im the worst version of my self. Idk my real self. And challengin my thoughts is so hard. And nothin really special ever happened in my entire life. 18 years of pointless livin Its like i chase girls online to make me ""Happy"" it should be the opposite. But i cant make friends with girls also. I chase everyone its never ppl chasing me Its never a girl liking me first or falling in love with me. and i please people just to give me attention and make me feel ""valued/worthy"" i guess this is why i always depended so hard on porn. Im just fucking invisible. No one gives a fuck about me, or misses me, or likes me or loves me, or even cares to start a convo with me. I just feel like i was born for nothing. Sometimes i wish i died. Im 18 idek how to have fun or meet ppl or make friends. Whats wrong with me? I have no plans no job or goals or big dreams or hobbies or passions, No one loves me i dont blame them. Im like an bactaria to this world. Im in bottom for everything. Only good thing about me is i know 2 langauges. Im not special. Just an invisible foolish idiot with no life. I have such a small mind. Im passive-aggressive. I have no qualities, no orginal opinions or creative ideas or big thoughts or sharp thinking. Im just nothing. Im at absolute 0. I always bore the fuck outta ppl. My convos are always boring. I always say 3 sentences other person says 1 word like their teeth is being taken out. Its always like they are forced to talk to me. Its like i always say close-ended things.. that ends any convo so soon. I always feel like people are too good/cool for me, i feel like they are smarter/funnier/cooler and assume no one likes me.I keep comparing my self to everyone even super stars in movies or tv shows. So what do i do to be likeable? Cool? Smart? Funny? A person with personality? How do i stop being opssessed with textin girls and porn? Ppl say be yourself? Idk who my real self is, who am i supposed to be? "
e6u16bx,"I bought a Guda Drum and started playing it in isolated parks, but now I play it around town. Most people aren't interested enough to talk, which is more than fine with me, but sometimes I get questions and compliments about the instrument. Aside from school, it's the most I interact with others, but I think it's a good start."
o6p667, Freaking out because I went skateboarding in long sleeves on a hot day. My dumb ass is freaking out because he went skateboarding in a long sleeve shirt. I didn't even think about what I was wearing cause I basically left to go skateboard on a drunk impulse. 
f0txp5c," Yeah, this isn't a very healthy way of thinking. That's like building a house on sand. I suggest you got to a cognitive behavioural therapist and learn about self-acceptance and the ability to enjoy life even without the approval and love of others. With your current philosophy ""I'm a shitty worthless person who can't do anything on their own. I need this man's love or else I can't bear to live. Then I'll truly be a shit."" you're going to be anxious all the time because he might stop loving you. Whenever he disapproves of what you're doing, you'll feel like shit. You'll have to bend over backwards for him even you don't want to for otherwise he might leave you. How can you gaurantee that he'll love you in two seconds? In a week? A month? A sandy foundation indeed. Not very healthy at all. Feeling Good by David Burns is a fantastic book that teaches cognitive behavioural therapy and it has a great chapter on why love is not a need and how to overcome neediness and live a more emotionally independant life. Check it out. "
ek0aify, I am not good on a bike at all. Never got thru the whole learning thing. Lol. I would make a flyer and post it up for anyone who wants to listen to music and sing along in a car ride there to call you. This way you can make your own fun and hopefully make a new friend. 
d8sbw91," The fact is that my therapist said it would be better if I found some activities that i like. So we set some hobbies I proposed as exposure exercises. I thought I liked them, for example I always wanted to do horse riding when I was young. But as time passed I was doing the activity only as an exposure exercise for my therapist, I was thinking ""if I don't do this, I'll fail for and therapist will think I'm a loser"". "
l7mnes,"Social Anxiety Relationship Advice: Is it an appropriate and respectful way to communicate where I’m at?. Hello, I (25 F) have been seeing someone (35 M) for two months and he’s pretty cool. I have social anxiety so I tend to be emotionally guarded. We’ve been having sex since the second date but all dates have been 12-24 hours and sex is honestly 1-2 hours out of each date. Some things we’ve done together - dinner/breakfast (he always cooks for me. I’ve baked for him twice), long walks, dancing together around the house, Netflix, exploring cozy local bars pre-lockdown. I asked him out for the first date and he’s been initiating all our dates since then. He is starting to open up about his anxiety (he still doesn’t know I have it, I’m very high functioning so it’s not visible). Today, he called me for the very first time on the phone to just chat. He did bring up a couple weeks ago that we should have a conversation about us some time and told me it’s okay for me to tell my friends and family that I’m seeing him. Not sure if this means we are dating? I am bad at social cues. I need everything to be spelled out. I’ve always coasted on being hot and just hooked up mostly because I find emotional intimacy difficult (got my heart broken by a person I loved for six years so I’m super cautious). I don’t know much about how to respectfully communicate to my man that I like him but I’m nervous so I’ll be a little bit slow with bf/gf labels. But I intend to stick around and I truly think he’s wonderful. I’m seeing him this Saturday and this is what I plan to say: “- I think it’s still early to be full-blown boyfriend and girlfriend. - But I want to know if we are more than hooking up. - Because I realized I like you a lot more than that, and I want to know where you are at. - Is our current pace okay?” Does this sound appropriate and respectful to y’all? I’d really appreciate your input because I do like the guy and this is new to me! Thank you so so much. TLDR: I (25F) am new to relationships and would like to not label bf/gf yet but do want to stick around and let him know I’m very much appreciative of him (35M). How do I communicate it respectfully? Very open to become his gf if we keep liking each other more and more."
rw22l9," What social group would you join?. I’m 22m working/studying from home for the past 3 years. All of my good friends have moved so I have to start over on my social circle. I have a hard time getting motivated to do anything social outside as I don’t gain ‘enough’ from it, even though it’s exposure. I’m into cycling, animals, nature, gaming and none of those I found good social opportunities for. I like to knock out two birds with one stone so meeting girls my age is half the goal besides having fun. People recommended me dance classes but I’m as romantic as a rock. There aren’t any Meetup groups in my age group so I’m wondering what you’d do, or are already doing in this situation :) "
qok9my,"the old neighbor lady did a complete 360 degree turn in personality. Im still shocked.. So we have this old woman neighbor who was always super nice to us when she saw us and our dad in our back yard. I remember just a few months ago when he mowed the back lawn, she and him would have long conversations. She even gave us bags of goodies for our mom. Well, tonight (technically last night cus at the time of writing this its 1:07 in the morning), that all ended. So we wanted to spend father-son time by having a bon fire/cookout. Just me, my little brother, and dad. We have this sunken in spot in the ground where we put charcoal and logs for the fire. We were all sitting, eating little Caesar's pizza and roasting marshmallows while listening to classic country music on my dads tablet. It was so relaxing and nostalgic. But it all ended when we all went in the house to use the bathroom. I was the last one to use it, while my dad and my brother went back outside. When I got done and went back outside, I saw the neighbor lady in a pink night robe talking to my dad. She was yelling at him about the fire, saying how ""it was right next to her garage and she has gasoline in there"", and other stuff like ""that could catch fire on trees and kill people."" Now, its one thing to complain about someones bonfire on their OWN property but then she out of the blue started attacking us for our religion. She told my dad ""You say that your a man of God yet your having bonfires that could kill people"" (Like, bruh, how is having an innocent little bon fire a sin? Whats even funnier is that she was cussing as she said that. Whats even more blood boiling is that she was frikin invading our privacy by holding her phone camera up to dad FILMING HIM!. She said that she ratted on us to the fire department and they said they would talk to us and my dad said they never did. She then brang up the time my little bro smashed her garage window with a baseball by accident. At the time my dad went to her house and offered to pay her but she said it was totally fine, but tonight after complaining about our fire she said ""And ye' break my window and dont say anything about it"" (Like I said, At the time my dad literally went to her house and offered her money, but she declined). My dads a peacemaker type and he hates confrontations so he was keeping his cool and nicely saying ""ok, we'll put it out"" But she wouldnt let us go. she kept saying stuff about safety and crap. because of my social anxiety I was cringing so hard That I was nervously shoving gramcrackers down my throat. Me and my dad were SHOCKED! Its like she was drunk or something. her personality changed 360°. Its almost as if she was bottling it all inside her all the previous times we had fires, and she snapped."
8vd9jl," I'm scared of doing anything fun alone.. So we currently have a heatwave that will last about a week here, and what do people usually do? Go to the beach, pool, whatever is available. But pools and beaches are FULL of people. It is my worst nightmare to be half nude in front of hundreds of strangers, I wouldn't even be able to enjoy the water. I wish there were private bodies of water I could go to where there's nobody, but I live in a metropolitan city... if I could go with someone I trust, I'd do it, I do have friends but most are busy or I couldn't ask them something like that. It's not just going to the pool, just anything really, like going to see a movie, a play, public activities, grand openings, etc. I just can't bring myself to do anything if I'm on my own. I feel like I'm missing out on so much, and it freaking sucks, i just want to be normal and enjoy activities even if I don't have anyone with me, but it makes me feel like a damn loser and I think everyone will see me this way if I go anywhere alone. I can only do grocery shopping and stuff like that because it's important... "
dj2lbwr,"I went to something very similar to this. It was a week long outdoors activity residential (hiking,rock climbing, etc) for kids my age that have a stutter (like me). Nearly EVERY person with a stutter also has SA because... Well duh? It was pretty heart warming and cute now that I think about it. All us kids being so awkward, stumbling on words all over the place trying to be friends. ;) Good memories..."
f5rhq6d, If I were in your case I wouldn’t worry about it. What’s amazing is that you got out of your comfort zone and benefited from it a lot. I never really did that and I probably should. I was in a similar situation but my mom forced me to go to camp. I barely talked to anyone there and everyone made lifelong friends except for me so that sucks lol. 
hp2apc,"I feel like I’m so behind in life.. I’m scared my whole family Will find out how stupid I am. I realized today the reason I hate being around my grandpa so much (more than just him being a complete asshole when I was younger and treating my grandma like shit) is because he asks me millions of questions about myself and I can’t handle the stress of answering these questions in front of my whole family. For example he will ask me about my college studies and I HATE talking about anything to do with me.... wanna know why??? (And I’ve never shared this with anyone) I feel too dumb to be in college. I’m wasting time and money on this because I know I probably can’t finish and/or don’t plan on living to see it through. Anyways yesterday my grandpa was here and he was asking my younger cousin about her school and she has everything planned out and has been known to be the smart grandchild for most of my life. I’ve always been fine with this as I don’t want anyone’s attention, ever. It just got me thinking wow I’m almost 20 at the end of this year and I don’t know anything about what I want in my life or what career path I want. I’m so stressed I can’t enjoy the rest of my camping trip. I want to go home and out of the public and my family where I’m open game for any and all questions... and when I don’t have an answer everyone will see how stupid I am. I truly feel like I’m incompetent and slow. I used to be very smart and feel a lot better about myself. But now it’s like either I’ve lost touch with who I really am or I really am this hallow of a person."
hofjrj,"Just a rant, you don’t have to read.. I was just on a beach vacation with my stepdads family. And something about being around large groups of people, especially people I don’t know as well, that just makes me completely shut down. I get such strong depressed feelings. I find that I don’t ever know how to respond to people. And I can feel how the energy changes when I enter the room. It’s like everyone walks on eggshells around me because they’re uncomfortable. They talk to me like I’m a baby. And rarely invite me to do things with the group as a whole. I’ve already dealt with being the one who didn’t get invited, but I hate that I’m 24 and still dealing with this issue. I can’t help feeling like I begin to dissociate the minute I enter a room full of people."
e4zvx3p," &gt; Hello everyone. &gt;I'm not sure if this is the correct sub but I have something to get off my chest, sort of. I'm sorry if this is poorly written; I'm not very good at writing. I am feeling depressed for about 2 years now but it wasn't as bad as it was these weekend. &gt; I’ve been in scouts for 8 years or so and it’s a great place to meet new people and friends. There was one girl, well actually two but I want to talk about the first one, Sara. I’ve known her for about 5-6 years and have liked her since I met her. 4 years ago when I started high school I stopped attending scouts because I was in another city; I tried to keep in touch with the group though. Still, I didn't hang out much with Sara because I was kind of socially awkward (at the time I didn't realize that was the reason). But as I was growing up I started to have more and more feelings towards her. &gt; &gt; So from a year ago, I noticed that the scouts were becoming more active and since it was coming to the end of the year I had more time to meet up with them. It was a little hard as first to fit back in since the group seems to know each other from kindergarten but I managed to fit it pretty quickly. There was one trip we went on where there wasn’t much work to do so we just hung out and had fun. It was a group of our head of Scouts, Sara, Sara’s friend, an older scout and myself. One night we were drinking and someone shared some weed. I had smoked it before so I knew what to expect but the others didn't. We were all having fun playing drunk volleyball and they were trying to teach me how to dance (didn't succeed) among other activities. After a while the others were sleepy as it was late but me and Sara were wide awake. Everyone else went to sleep while we hung out another 2 hours and had a lot of fun. She said she had a boyfriend but also said she wasn’t really the relationship type. We had a couple of more nights similar to that one. I had to stop meeting up with the scouts when I started college since it was in the same city that I went to high school. I fucked up a whole year in collage and dropped out. &gt; That brings us to this particular weekend. There was an annual Renaissance Fair that set up next to the base for the Scouts. Everyday we played that game where you would sit on a barrel, someone would throw at a bullseye and if they hit you would fall into the barrel of water. After that we drank thought the night until morning; we repeated this over 4 days. &gt; &gt; Me and my friends had some weed left and smoked some and everything was good. But after 3 smoke it fucked me up good. I couldn't think, I couldn't do anything so I just sat and tried to think straight for couple of seconds. After some time I went out to get some fresh air. 5 minutes later, one of my friends, Tim, came outside and we talked. Then came the second of the two girls I mentioned at the start, let’s call her Amy. Amy was drunk and sleepy. She sat down with us and asked me if she can lean on my shoulder and I said sure. Everyone except Time decided to stay. So after a while he went home and Amy asked me if I wanted to go sleep with her in that room. I didn't know what to do. I said I don't know and that I wasn’t that sleepy. After some negotiation I agreed and we went towards the room. The room was right next to the kitchen where everyone else was. As we were passing by Sara grabbed my hand and said something to me (I can't remember what exactly) and I went with her and Amy and sat down to watch what was happening because I was too fucked up from the weed. Sara sat next to me and said she wanted to dance with me but I couldn’t even move. She was pulling me by my hand but I just wanted to sit down and chill. Eventually she back down next to me and just held my hand. We started talking and somehow I ended up sitting outside by myself. Amy came by later and asked if I was alright. I said yeah that I just wanted some fresh air. Then Sara came again and asked me the same. Amy left and Sara and I started talking. She asked my why was I depressed. I was a bit in shocked since I never told anyone about it and wasn’t planning to; I tried to hide it as much as I could but I guess I didn’t try hard enough. She was holding my hand the entire time and hugging me. She actually knew I liked her because our head of Scout told her, on her birthday, when her boyfriend was in another room. She put her head on my shoulders and kept asking me if I had something to say to her. My heart was pumping so fast and i couldn't do anything. I wanted to say so many things but all I could say was, ""I can't think"". That was literally the only thing I could say. We had some similar things like when we were sitting down she kept reaching for my leg. &gt; &gt; Now after 3 days I feel so bad about that night. I feel like I hit rock bottom. I never felt so sad. Feels like I missed a chance with her. The second day I still felt a bit fucked up from the weed. I made some more mistakes like the second night I smoked a bit more and it fucked me up even more. Good thing she didn't want to drink that night. I said that I don't feel good and that I am going home to get some rest. When I got home I felt like a big piece of shit. I sat down in front of my PC try to get a hold of myself. I put some music on Spotify and just burst into tears. I didn't know what to do. It was the first time that I felt so bad that I started crying. I even tried to cut my arm with the knife which actually helped for a bit so I could compose myself enough to go to bed. The next day I just tried to act like nothing happened. And again that night I felt so sad that I couldn't do anything. I couldn't eat, sleep, play games, listen to music, nothing. I had volunteered to help clean up the Scout’s HQ the next day. I got there early and sat down. After a couple of minutes Sara came. My heart started racing again. We had some time to talk before everyone else came and then we hung out together for most of the day. I had more important things to do but i just couldn't go. Now my father is furious because I missed my driving school. &gt; &gt; And that more or less is everything. I just realized I missed some details. I just hope nobody that knows me sees this. Hopefully it is not too badly written because I am not very good at writing like this. If you got this far I just want to thank you for reading. Did my best to make this more readable while still conveying your thoughts. Some parts I didn't understand enough myself to correct. "
qzidc1," Am I weird for having a reflex to avoid friends?. Whenever I see a friend group in the distance, coming towards me I feel stressed because I feel forced to interact with them. I escape this stress by walking in a different direction or even hiding behind a shelf until they’ve passed me. After that happens, I feel a mix of relief and guilt. Is this considered as being shy or just super weird? "
780gg6,"Living at home, constantly reminded of having no future. UPDATE: just want to say thank you so much to everyone who has commented,  it really means so much. nnAs it is I have no future. I'm unemployed (over a year) and have little to no interaction with anyone outside of who I live with.  I don't talk to them either really. nnIts becoming unbearable.  I'm constantly questioned what are my plans? what am I going to do?  I'm told I have no future and that I can't depend on my parents forever. I'm told I need to make money,  it doesn't grow on trees etc I'm constantly reminded of all these things nnI don't know what to do. I'm petrified to apply for jobs. Anytime I do apply, I never hear anything from them. I can't even imagine going to an interview if I were to get one,  I'd be too scared. nnI'd like to make money online and have been looking into it but I don't know where / how to start. nnDoes anyone else live at home? Can you relate?  How do you deal with constantly being reminded of how you're failing at life? Are you questioned on what you're doing with your life,  how do you answer these questions?  nnI'm essentially mute because I don't have answers or responses to anything. All I can think when I hear this is that I already know I'm a failure, I don't need to be reminded. I don't know what to do, I don't have all/any of the answers. nnIf you're in a similar position,  do you have anyway you make money. Or are you living off savings / your parents?  I try not to spend much but I'm using savings and my dad keeps giving me money and giving out to me about having to give me money,  even though I always say I don't need it."
e0iwk79, Ugh I totally relate!!! I confided in one friend about my quietness and how I *hate* how people comment on it. We later go on a camping trip and she kept saying “wow. You’re being so quiet” I was more hurt than mad. 
4tm0i4,"Travel Anxiety + Hard Decision. Hi, thank you for clicking on my post. I will try to keep this short, but it is kind of a long story. I am 18 years old, have had anxiety ever since I can remember, and don't take any medication. I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend Bob for ~ 3.5 years. Bob has been wanting to go to a music festival 1,000 miles away for awhile. I've avoided thinking about it for a long time. We have absolutely nothing planned, nothing prepared, 0. We have to leave tomorrow to get there on time. It is 3-4 days long camping. No electricity, no showers, you have to sleep in a tent, no indoor toilets, no cell phone service. In addition, we have to leave three days early in order to drive there. I'm scared of everything. I'm scared of leaving my house, I get terrified if I feel a little weird, I'm scared of going pretty much anywhere, I'm scared of driving, I'm scared of socializing, I'm rly rly scared. First, I was scared about going that I would feel out of my body (DP/DR) and just get so scared and have a major panic attack and just be horrifically miserable. Then I was scared about being too scared to leave the tent and ruining the trip. Now I'm scared of all those things + me and Bob getting in a fight and ruining it for him. The relationship between me and Bob has not been good recently. I've been flip flopping this whole time about going vs not going. Bob was upset with the relationship because we've been having a dead bedroom, and I think that got him in a depressed mood. He returned the tent and mattress we bought for the trip and said we weren't going (2 days ago I think.) Then he's been saying stuff like the relationship might have to be over, it makes him miserable, and he resents it for ruining the trip and that he's not mad at me. After that he's been saying he needs space and doesn't want me around him. Bob has had a history of making me leave his house during a hang out when he gets mad at me, or for telling me it's miserable spending time with me and turning around to drop me off when we're going to an event. I'm worried about getting in a fight during the trip. The reason why I do want to go, and why I'm very conflicted about saying no, is because this is Bob's dream vacation. His favorite band is playing their last show. He's been looking forward to this for months and working lots of overtime to save up for it. I don't mean to make Bob sound like a bad person at all. He does have some depression and anger issues, but I also have lots of issues with anxiety and expressing myself. He is a great person and great boyfriend. Bob is still upset for me that events I haven't attended in the past such as parties. I have gone to some, but there has been a lot that I didn't go to because of my anxiety. It does sound like a very fun vacation, and I wish more than anything that I could go and have a great time with Bob. But, after writing all this out, it really seems like I shouldn't go with the current state of the relationship. I think he would have a better time going alone. But, I don't want him to resent the relationship and me for not going. I'm so, so, so conflicted. This is entirely my fault for avoiding and not preparing for the trip ahead of time. Yesterday Bob said we weren't going at all (not even him alone) and I said I'm so sorry, next time I will prepare better, and he said there won;t be a next time and he's never looking forward to anything again. I don't think he still feels that way today This morning he said he would go on the trip alone and didn't think it was a good idea for me to come but that he wants me to come. Then he took back that he said it would be a bad idea but he'll understand if I don't want to go. I want to disappear. This was supposed to be an amazing trip and a great time for us together but I feel I've ruined it all. I feel too scared to go. I don't know what to do. I have 30 minutes to tell him if I'm going or now. Thank you so much for reading, sorry if I missed anything. I would greatly appreciate it if you shared any thoughts/advice with me."
no1u0g," I know there are a lot of people here who have jobs and have social anxiety. How do you do it? (desperate ranting). I’m wondering how you deal with it while your at work. Do you just do it and then when you get home you’re exhausted? I’d like to know what I will have to expect? Will it be like when I was in highschool where I went to school and the whole time it’s like I wasn’t even alive and just in another world? But it can’t be like that on a job, right? Or else I’m gonna fuck up. I just feel so weird around other people. I feel like I don’t belong and like...I’m living in a different reality? I feel too weird. I just do not know how i’m supposed to do it. Ive been going outside more recently just for like errands and shit..but i don’t think it’s gotten better! I still feel so out of place! It’s probably cus I have zero friends and very little experience with socializing and friends...But how do I just make a friend?? I guess I just need to say fuck it. I’m so persistent on not pretending but I need to suck it up and just fuckin pretend if I have to. Is that what you guys do? And then when I get home I can be tired and sad...Do i have to just pretend i’m a different person at work and while I’m filling out the job application and when i’m on the phone? I feel like that would just make me want to die even more eventually. "
j4y1wd,"(Kinda long post) I have a solid plan/strategy to approach strangers but I have zero confidence.... In trying to find opening sentences, I don't want it to be a game but if I can have a more solid idea of how strangers really react to things u say I can have a better idea what to say in the moment. The first thing I thought, i go university, I know a lot of beautiful places around here, my uni has a lot of countryside and nature. I doubt many of the students know about the places I've been, so I think I can go up to a girl and ask if she wants to go on a walk with me. (yes a girl, I want a girlfriend and of I don't try to speak up and slowly build up my confidence now I might never find a partner. No she isn't my test monkey, I understand she is a real human with real emotions and I want to explore that, if that makes any sense) Anyways, I'm good at making convo, but I'm not good at starting it. Most people think I'm quiet or shy or a loner in general. But it's because I expect people to come up to me and give me a chance. I want that to change, I want to be the person who goes up to people to give them chances to express themselves. That's why I wanna do this. Also I feel like this will work because I'm at university and just like me, everyone is scrambling around looking for friends all the time. It's a new environment with hundreds of students. I'm sure they'd appreciate it if they get noticed. And the only thing I can think of that I MIGHT have the courage to say to her is if she wants to go on a walk with me. To a cool nature place thingy I know. U can see the whole town from up there and no one else really knows about. And it's not the only cool place I know. I need someone to tag along with to go on adventures with! But that's not my top priority, I just want that human experience. Some company for once. Ok taht was unnecessarily long, so I know what to say, I don't really know where to go, maybe library or around town, the bus stop, who knows where I'll find someone that catches my eye. Okay, so why am I still scared as hell? I know I'm never actually gonna do this!! It's way to scary. I'm gonna stutter or be really shy or smthn will go very wrong. Or I just won't do it at all. But I had it all planned out! What's the real secret to confidence..... Is it something u learn. All I need is the courage to say ""hi"" and boom, the convo part is easy as hell 4 me. I've nevr had any real friends or relationships at all. I've never done this kind of thing but I know I need to if I want things to change."
emq1df6,"It has been affecting my relationship a lot lately, and my partner has been asking me to seek therapy. I have epilepsy which due to college stress has worsened and I think it has had the biggest impact. Last semester there were modules to which I went to the first lecture and that was it, I tried my hardest to study at home rather than have to be surrounded by people. Without realising it every movement I do in public I plan ahead. This morning while getting ready to leave the house I broke down because I could only find a white hoody which I couldn’t possibly wear as it would attract attention to me. I also wanted to take my dog out for a walk but there was too much traffic outside. When crossing a small road, when not in a crowd, I could stand at a light for 10 minutes waiting for a gap between cars as I can’t get myself to press the traffic light as I don’t want to stop the cars and have them stare at me. Sorry for venting, I just don’t really have anyone to say this to and my boyfriend just finds it ridiculous."
flde5ie," lol i feel this i started the year wouldnt say thiriving but i had a lot of things going for me that would get me out of my comfort zone and i could see improvements started uni, started playing soccer, was going gym, got a new job. now litterely all those things have been cancelled, the introverted part of me is secretly loving it but I know its going to be very tough to get back into it. "
f2x1vq6," I suggest you read that book because it covers everything from panic attacks, to fear shyness, and all that stuff. Also check out A guide to rational living by Albert Ellis. Of course you had ""beliefs back"" then. When I say ""beliefs"" I mean your automatic perception about situations. For example, if I threw a baseball towards your face, you'd automatically think ""Oh shit a ball is coming to my face. It could really hurt me. That would be terrible"" and as such you have feelings of anxiety. Similarily in social situations and other situations you have automatic beliefs or perceptions, that are irrational, that cause your negative feelings. For instance, ""It's absolutely necessary that I act perfectly in everything I do and in front of people. I HAVE TO win everyone's approval."" EDIT: I also had social anxiety as far as I can remember. It's irrelevant when you got it. "
oymwl1," i wish i was some genius or be someone else.. i always compare my self to others and feel like others are superior to me but i try to tone it down by telling my self they are human as well. and also make mistakes i know i have to love my self and stop chasing approval of others but i dont know how i wish i was smart or intelligent but i dont know what i should be smart about or how to be intelligent at work before i speak i think about what if they think im stupid, so i just shut up for a whole day sometimes, sometimes i wish i had others personalities i think of ""if i say this it might come off as desperate or needy worst of all stupid"" idk how to change my ""people pleaser"" personality is it good to talk? is it good to be quiet? do i need to be balanced? im 19 and i live in a small town in iraq/kurdistan. soccer is basically the only hobby available wish i could so martial arts or swim everyday but i cant so i just do push ups everyday. im gonna avoid porn forever but it will be hard since no dating in my town allowed unless you get married. im gonna delete all my texting apps. maybe i need a goal but i dont know what to choose so many fucking options in the world and no fucking opportunities for me. i try to study and get to college hopefully next year. i compare my self to batman or Einstein or twitch streamers all successful maybe charming and have gfs wish i had skills but i dont know what skill is most useful for me im trying to learn arabic and learn martial art from youtube or read a book. i want to learn so many things and im curious about so many fucking things in the world and so little time and so little resources to experience them. so many careers so many people so many books and content on the interent. infinite knowledge around the world and i cant have it all but what matters most is what makes me happy instead of chasing approval right? i just dont know what that is. right now i work as a mechanic so another skill for me to learn "
gm1ael," Waited in a hospital for 3 hours before I gave up on trying for a urine test. I went to pee this morning, that was a huge mistake. Went to this place and went to do the blood+urine test thing. But once you have already let your urine go, you are stressed in so many different ways (caretaker was waiting for me, people in line waiting for me), my soon-to-be urine water switched roles to become sweat instead and on top of it all I was aware the nurse or whatever was looking as I was trying (to confirm it was me doing it, I did not do any drugs etcetc).. it's hard to really focus on waterfalls and getting that urine out. Especially with social anxiety where all of my thoughts and focus were on what she was thinking and if she ever saw my baby dick. "
r1s1xb," Scared. Hello. I'm a 19 year old university student who is continuously typing and rewriting words in hope to find words along the way. I'm studying such a stream which requires me to be vocal and be able to tenaciously tackle my opponent. I've recognized that I'm struggling with social anxiety at this moment. And I'm too scared to discuss this with my parents. I'm afraid this will impact on my studies as well as in my social relationships. However, I try to be fake confident as much as possible in order to get my stuff done and so far it has helped. But still there are few instances where I feel like I should be more vocal and take action before the fire puts out. In these scenarios, I'm unable to. And I can see my oppurtunities slipping past through me. I feel like I can't perform my best if I have other person who knows me previously infront of me. I feel like they judge me as incompetent and probably makes fun of me. I really just want to do things on my own and not to wait for others. I really don't know how to proceed further and would be really helpful if any tips are given to tackle my current situation. "

Do you have any hobbies, are you part of anything? Try picking up something, and don't worry if you don't like the first thing you try.

ii5hnq, What are you all like at family gatherings?. I keep thinking about how awkward I am at family gatherings and at my most recent one I brought a friend and feel like I kind of avoided most of my family. It got me thinking about how my family perceives me and I feel like they probably just think I’m a b*tch because I keep to myself so much. I made a little small talk with my aunts and uncles but remember me and the friend going outside away from the crowd and staying out there most of the time. My cousins are my age but I never know how to talk to them so when I saw them I acted like I was busy. One of them also brought his new girlfriend which made me feel even more awkward cause I didn’t know how to introduce myself without it feeling weird and unnatural so I just played it off like I was caught up in a conversation with my friend. Does this sound familiar to any of you? I literally see this side of my family every/only on holidays so I feel like I shouldn’t still feel this awkward around them but I do.

b3u4h3," How I Became Socially Anxious. I don't know if I have ever had the disorder, but, I have definitely been extremely shy since I was about 11.When I was 11, I started playing Skyrim. What a brilliant game. It's so unbelievably immersive. You can do so many things in so many different ways. You can be a thief. You can be a hero. You can be a thief who just kills anyone who gets in his way or one who carefully tip toes around the place, taking great care to not be seen. Although let's be honest, you'll probably just be a stealth archer. You're always constantly working towards something. That next cool set, double-enchantment, having three words of a shout you think is cool, getting Max one-handed, destruction, whatever. I can't put into words how much I loved Skyrim. That's the problem. I really, really loved Skyrim. I loved it so much, that whenever my friends called over I didn't answer. Why would I? Skyrim was better. I loved it so much, I didn't call over to them. We lost contact. I didn't care. The only time I left the house, was when I went to school. I talked to my friends there and all,but...well. In my country, the Summer holidays are absurdly long. About 2 months or so in primary school(I believe you filthy cheese-burger eating,crisp-crunching Americans call it Elementary School. My English ancestors call it primary school aswell, I think?). So anyway, after 2 months not talking to anyone, I went into secondary school looking like a vampire. I was about as pale as you could get. I still am. I had terrible social skills. But... Secondary school,as we Irish call it,forces you to talk to other people. They feck you into a class with people you don't know, and as I realised, it's fortunately easier to make friends then it feels. Because of this, I realised how much I missed talking to people. I realised how fun it was to play football with your friends, or fuck around for 2 hours in the sunshine. But now,I felt afraid about all that. Calling over to someone's house was a mammoth effort and I would always sweat buckets and stammer even more than usual. That makes it sound like I did still go to other people's houses. I didnt. I don't. That's what would happen if I somehow did. So...yeah. I fucked myself over, and now I feel like my house is a prison. I don't feel socially anxious in school anymore, though. I used to hate school soooo much because of how many people there were. I'm somewhat used to that now. Maybe I will be able to leave the house now. The problem is,I just don't know what is or isn't socially acceptable. Would I be seen as weird for asking to come over to someone's house? Would it be weird to ask someone if I could play a tennis match against them?(I do play tennis with the few friends I have,sometimes.My parents force me to do tennis training.)I'm not that awkward. I can make people laugh without too much effort,or I at least when they're people I feel comfortable around. I'm just clueless,alone and afraid for what the future holds. "
fv2it86," I’m dreading Friday, either going bowling or golfing with my friends. Idk why but I just hate upcoming things, but I need to expand my boundaries, so it’s worth it. "
pt96n8, Something I remembered about school. There was a time in high school where I hardly had any friends so sometimes during our breaks I would just sit alone in the class and read or something but mostly I felt very pathetic sitting there while I could hear the groups of people chatting in the hallway who could see me through the door so I would go on long walks around the school and pretend like I had somewhere to be when I passed people and after a little while I'd enter an empty bathroom and stay until someone walked in. I did get friends later on but they were really into Table Tennis and something about tt tables turned them into giant assholes and they wouldn't let me participate or talk at all so I was forced to do all that again sometimes. 
ouz889," Some simple (subjective) truths about social anxiety I've learned. The best preperation for social situations are smaller social situations. The day starts with me walking on the street. Then I am in the store buying some soft drink. Then I feel ready to meet with a friend or approach someone to have small talk with. Guys, before hard social situations, do something smaller. It gives you the feeling of being capable and especially when you do well, you get confident. When you seem less anxious, you get less anxious. Let's be real here. When you are anxious, but you manage to come across as not anxious, you have no reason to be anxious. That is why we want to do the following things: Speak loud, speak slow. Keep your head up and your arms away from your body. Stepping on the ground harder or moving your arms are tips I've never really heard about, but I discovered them to be effective for me. When I stand outside in public and lift my arms up or make a little dance move or pushing my fist against my chest gets me ready for action. Your body is what enables you to interact with the world. Move your body. It makes you feel less fragile. When you wait until you feel ready, you will never do the social interaction. If you do it anyways, you will at leat see where you are at and you will get irrational negative beliefs out of you (not being able to talk, completely failing, ) "
e1vsopc,"I don't play that much, normally about 2 hours a day, some times I go months without playing video games at all. I make the effort to go out at least once a day even if it is only a walk to shops and I have college most days, when it isn't the summer. It isn't that I spend too much time on it, maybe I worded that wrong. They just don't understand why I like gaming when I could be doing something else that they like, for example reading a book in the garden. nnI have quite a few hobbies, photography one of them so that keeps me busy."
bruqaj,"Tomorrow morning I will go for a run, with as little anxiety as possible. I usually donÂ¬Â¥t do morning runs, but its time for a change of my lifestyle. I will wake up earlier tomorrow, drink a glass of water, eat half a banana and run and not care about what people think bout me or if my hair looks messy after sleeping!"
dg9us97," Wow your story is actually very similar to mine, I discovered the severity of my social anxiety when I went to a ""open air"" rave, I don't know how to say it in english, basically a festival in an open area, it was actually very beautiful, the setting was in the middle of a couple of very beautiful mountains, the stage lined perfectly to the sunset and the music was very powerful.. But then it started getting crowded, waaaay to crowded for confort (close to 20.000 people in a small area), also I had taken a hit of LSD beforehand, because I had already used it before and felt great and I felt empowered to change things I thought I would feel the same in a social situation. Well, that day I began respecting LSD, set and setting. I loved the way it throws my brain into this hyper state of mindfulness and wonder, but I didn't realize it could also throw you into a downward spiral, feeding your fears even faster and making them feel extremelly real, that day I honestly thought I was going to turn crazy... But in a way I miss it, everything was so beautiful, the music, the mountains, nature. If only my anxiety hadn't got in the way. And the mind reader thing is very present indeed, I act like I know that im going to screw everything up and then I proceed to overthink things that could go wrong, basically making me feel awful and weird all day, and when the time comes you're just not on the same ""vibe"" as people that are there to just enjoy the moment, so it becomes self-fulfilling, you're awkward not because you ARE awkward, you're awkward because of all that negative thoughts prior to the experience, I like to think it's like I am a reverse coach, instead of pumping my team up I just shout incredibly offensive and deep rooted insecurities at them. That will make them play well im sure! haha... I like your idea of the topics notes, it's not trying to predict anything, it just gives me the confort that I have something to fall to in case things go ""wrong"". Could help with the anxiety.. I ended up deciding to go, I talked to a friend about him driving my car and he said that he wouldn't want to go if I wasn't going, so yeah, even though now I don't have an option to quit I actually feel kind of good, I know I must face my fears if I wish to grow, so im going to take this as a growth opportunity, I hope all goes well haha =p Thanks for the words, I was feeling very helpless the day I posted this.. (Im not a native speaker sorry for my english) "
cfdm74,"I have such a negative outlook. Sometimes I feel really worthless about myself. I just hate it.. I don't even know if it's possible to change. This is probably going to be a long post sorry. But here goes. I have recently turned 23 years old, Male, going into my last year of college next month. I have bad anxiety, low self esteem, and possibly depression and on the spectrum that seems like it's taking over my life. It doesn't help that I am such a negative person with a negative outlook on literally almost everything. I complain about a lot of things, to the point my family get's mad at me. The smallest things annoy me such as my siblings when they do minor things, if anyone jokes around with me I take it offensive and get aggressive, then get yelled at. Which then I take being yelled at to heart and start having negative thoughts about myself. I now live with my parents due to being unable to afford an apartment with no roommates, after I was previously living with a sibling (who lives now with a friend). I help out a little and pay bills each month so I'm not living rent free.  I have never had a real job but make money by reselling video games and electronics for the past 4 years locally and online, wanting to even have my own store, but that's not enough. It doesn't help that I feel picky about job searches. I don't want to work at a fast food restaurant (too much people which would make it stressful), cleaning jobs, manual labor (construction, lawn, outside jobs), etc. I don't mind retail as that's similar to selling stuff and I even applied to many places recently, and even went on an interview last month that I thought went well, despite being extremely nervous prior. I got a rejection email a few days later. I am tech savvy and feel like I could do better in an office setting or doing something with computers, but when I see job requirements I feel very overwhelmed and under qualified because I know there's always someone much better than me and that I have no ""actual"" work experience apart from interacting with customers for sales, and some volunteering I did before and a school club I was in, even though I'm told to just apply and be confident. I have never had any internships either and I'm now trying to apply to them and prepare. But feel overwhelmed and like I'm not good enough, to the point I get scared that I won't have any kind of job after graduation. I am in school for Video Game Design, but I feel like crap compared to peers who I know some constantly work on their craft, had some internships, and are way better than me. That really discourages me. It also doesn't help that I have no networking like people should in this field. It's something that seems really difficult for me of course. I make my own small games too but have not in a long time due to lack of energy and ideas, apart from school group projects and game jams, which in the end of those I am always told I do really well and the people loved having me in their groups. I mainly focus on the art and design aspect.  I never really had a social life ever, no friends apart from very few ""school friends"". I have never had a girlfriend either and probably I never will. I have been on only 1 date, 2 years ago with someone from online dating, which I will never do again. (girl was way different in person and seemed rude texting the whole time, plus people never respond). I also wasted time on a girl (online) for 6 months after that who actually talked to me first but I pushed boundaries when she wasn't really quick to respond to me and I'd constantly get mad. Eventually she changed her number and ignored me. I even started doing crappy in school at that time since I spent time stalking her and gained weight (I have since lost nearly 20 pounds since and am doing much better in school.) I figured I will never talk to a girl again after that point. I feel like I'm an average looking guy though sometimes I feel like I'm really ugly (If you really want to see me, PM me) I actually missed chances with some really nice girls who seemed interested in me during Middle and High school because when they'd talk to me I'd start acting really weird and push them away. Same with when people tried being my friend sometimes. I am very shy and socially awkward. I am also afraid of showing people how I really am. Nobody wants a negative person with probably nothing to offer anyone around them. They want confident and non clingy people. Sometimes I am content with being alone and just accept the fact, but other times I long for people and feel like crap especially when I see couples and attractive women in stores, school, or on the bus, etc. You can't depend on others for happiness as they say. I can't drive due to a minor vision disability so therefore I am almost always home unless I have to go out. I have hobbies and interests such as retro gaming, making youtube videos, computers, game design and producing my own music MIDI's, drawing, and watching TV (mainly cartoons), among some others. But lately all I ever have energy to do is lay down and daydream of the worst scenarios, and therefore I only do things if it's for school, never really for fun, like I lost interest. I feel like I am not good enough for anything and quit easy. I feel even worse when my younger siblings have real jobs, could drive, and are very happy often and they do not let things get to them. I don't want to feel like this anymore. Sorry this was long."
e4h2vwm,"Maybe go out to drinking/strip club with your construction pals? I once spent an entire summer working with my dad. For 2 months he was the only person i spoke and hang out with, very bad for my mental health. I would not give up online dating, but I also do not know exactly what ""pretty rough scenarios"" refer to. Also maybe signing to some course of your interest? (language, sports, camping etc...) I know its very scary and I probably would not even have the balls, but its a lot less pressure than school. Online friends should also not be underestimated. Many times it does not lead to anything, but I have a friend who met her wife playing World of Warcraft. If your psychological state is very weak (there was a time I could not even speak on the phone inside my house due to panic attacks), consider using some medication and therapy, there are many antidepressants to try that do not have serious secondary effects."
cx4wutt," I get a similar feeling. If I spend one day without meeting anyone I start to feel pretty confident. After 3 days the constant stream of negative thoughts start to die out. After 5 days I start to shrug my social anxiety off as 'no big deal'. Then I run out of food, go out, meet the first person on the street and... it hits me harder then ever. "
pdxsut," Debating on whether or not I should do basketball. Haven’t played competitive basketball since I was in 7th grade. I’ve always loved basketball but the thing that made me stop doing it was because I’d always get so much anxiety playing. Even though, deep down I loved playing the game, I always felt like I couldn’t play as good as I could have possibly have, compared to how I play really good when I’m just by myself, playing in my backyard. My fears were always about getting yelled at by coaches and teammates, and of players bigger and better than me, and I always let that get the best of me. And trust me, the anxiety was bad, on days I’d have b-ball practice I’d just sit in school and think about not wanting to go to practice because of the anxiety, and not even wanting to play in games because of the anxiety. But when I’m in my backyard playing, it’s just completely different, I feel comfortable, not afraid to make mistakes and I’m just acting like myself. I’ve always thought, like man, how good would it be if I could play competitive basketball and not let this anxiety control my headspace and effect the way I play…. So high school basketball tryouts are coming soon, and even though I’m afraid of feeling like how I did in the past, when I played basketball competitively, I feel like in the future I’ll regret not playing basketball for my school in high school because I let the anxiety control me and prevent me from doing what I wanted to do. So yeah just wanted to post this to see about anyone’s thoughts. "
dg8e6a3," That's intense, dude. I'm really sorry to hear that. We can chat a bit if you need some companionship. I've been there, believe me. Two years ago, I was completely lost at sea, completely confused, self-hating and wanted to end the pain. Things got better though, and it's near-impossible to do it alone. It takes courage, though, that's the thing. I know it seems like going to the gym right now is the end of the world because of the possible awkward interactions, but in all honesty, nobody cares... nobody cares if you fuck up. They might snicker, but they won't think about it again. So it should be something you do for YOURSELF. Anyway. What's ailing you/where are you from? I'm from New Brunswick, Canada. "
m3vs4x," I’ve got a story of hope for my social anxiety people. So for years I’ve been too anxious to approach any girl. Today I saw this cute girl who was bagging at my local grocery store. My first trip I was with my grandmother so I felt pretty uncomfortable trying to ask her for her number. I couldn’t stop thinking about her so I decided to just bike down to the store with a flat tire lol, I went in and there she was just chilling. So I went in and a had a bit of a brain fart when I started talking to her and I gave her my number instead of getting hers which I was a bit upset about. But hey I stepped outside of my comfort zone and went and did something I never thought I could do. I hope all of you are able to get out of your comfort zone, I’m telling you it’s a freeing feeling. Social anxiety is the most irrational fear, it doesn’t make any sense, so just fight back and throw yourself into uncomfortable situations. Best of luck to all of you "
fdd8e9i," That’s true. I went way too long thinking it was the other way around or believing I’d just magically become confident one day but alas, I’m ready for hard work and scary times! I recently graduated so I’m aiming to make friends with or at least become good acquaintances with those at a job I’ll hopefully get soon. I’m also planning on joining yoga classes (I tried it once but dropped it due to SA but I plan to stick to it this time around) and volunteering outdoors once spring rolls around! But even small things like smiling at people while walking my dog or going to a cashier instead of self checkout are a daily goal. "
7edbfa,"Showing affection in public. On Friday, November 17th, I confessed my undying love to my closest friend who has helped me through the hardest years of my life. And he loves me back just as much. The kind of love that comes only once in a lifetime. We spent the whole weekend fantasizing about our future together and how much we've helped each other over the past year. Today was the first day we saw each other since Friday. And it was... a combination of awkward and amazing. The whole bus ride (which is about an hour long), was largely silent say for a few sentences to each other. We could feel the butterflies but we couldn't really act on them. The whole day was largely this way. For lack of a better term I'm largely the ""dominant"" one in the relationship. However, this is the first relationship I've ever been in, and I'm finding it really REALLY hard to find ways to show my unending oceans of love, at least in public. The whole day we're around each other is in public. On the bus, in classes, in the hallway. Everywhere we go we have people around us. So, I ask to any of you out there, do you have any tips or pointers to get past the social anxiety and just focus on the person I want to be with forever? I'm normally very quiet and I want to break this shell. Thank you."
dliart8," Thanks! I appreciate the encouragement, and am making plans for a short solo backpacking trip "
p475hz," What is worth doing in life? I want to stop wasting my fucking time and be good at something. i need to have better goals than ""making friends"" or ""Getting a Nude online"" and since i cant make any friends i feel like i have no personality. and i feel like everyone is better than me at everything i need to have a meaningful or useful goal but i dont know what. reading? exercising? but whats the point of those? i want to learn more but i don't know what i should learn, i want to work hard to gain skills but idk what skill i should have there is just too many careers and too many books and too many skills to learn and so little time.. i dont want to be a failure i want to be smart and witty and assertive but im like 20% of those.. im working with my dad to be a mechanic. im trying to finish school.and im 20 tomorrow and i failed 3 years in school. i don't want to waste any more time chasing people or spending time watching porn but i wanna do bigger things. sometimes i compare my self to famous historical characters and feel small its always me chasing others and im tired of this. i want to have friends without me chasing them all the time, no one chases me, or truly likes me. I feel like i have no value i know this isnt true but why dont i believe it? im also anti-social but i dont wanna die alone and i want to learn from others, but i don't even know what to talk about with people. i live in a small town in iraq/kurdistan. there isn't much to do, you cant even date here the only hobby i ever had is soccer because its the only thing to do. this town is a killer of dreams and i Compare my self to others. like people on YouTube or successful twitch streamers. and i feel like shit compared to them i know everyone has problems so sometimes i dont feel that bad about my life, i know i need to only focus on me and improve but I don't know what to improve.. i try to talk more to others and go out more, trying to quit porn but i want to do bigger things i feel like rn i should focus on work/finishing school and learning another language but all 3 sound super boring so i watch YouTube from time to time or listen to music or read comics since there is nothing to do outside of work "
e0aa7r2," I've had more than one therapist/psych suggest I could be autistic, despite me telling them straight on I didn't identify with it. 'Oh, you're kind of a loner and you're experiencing depression/anxiety and you're having trouble adjusting to daily routines in college? Yeah that's gotta be autism, get tested for it'. Heck, my own mother whose main problem is being too perfectionistic and achievement-driven for her own good once got told her colleagues thought she could be autistic, because they 'didn't want her to keep pushing for changing performance in the department for the better and she just didn't seem to get the hint??'. So, yes, I do think a hasty misdiagnosis isn't uncommon, but deeper level testing can show the differences. One aspect that often gets conflated with a disorder is High Sensitivity. People on the spectrum seem to match with that, too, except in autism it's like that high sensitivity is turned way up from 'can't breeze over things and processes very deeply' to 'doesn't have a filter in incoming information at all anymore and gets totally drowned in the processing noise so no usable result comes out at all anymore'. Normal sensitivity is like having a high speed highway with a normal amount of information-cars passing through. High sensitivity is having an extremely busy densely packed high speed highway in your brain, meaning reaching conclusions can take longer and some events are processed with way more nuance. Autism is like having that, except the cars get into messy pileups because there's even more of them, where information overload just jams processing entirely. High sensitivity is actually relatively common, ~20% of the human population shows it, and related 'personality traits' like the shy-bold continuum exist in many species, even fish and bugs. It's useful to have a sub-population of more alert and cautious individuals, you never know when unexpected things happen that require a different approach from 'do what we always do without overthinking it till it works'. Sometimes you 'need' that one cautious monkey who's capable of watching a trap from afar, and figure out a way around it. Or that one slightly more paranoid sheep that sniffs out a blight early and leads the herd away. The reason they're never the majority in the population is that a) there is a cost to deeper processing, like often being pretty bad at 'think quick!' competitions and boldness displays, it takes energy and time, and b) if everyone's taking a more thorough approach to things, it's no longer more thorough than average and it stops being an advantage as much and c) if everyone's too cautious to act, you're gonna have a lot of hungry monkeys when instead you could just go and get the damn banana Joe, everything's fine don't overcomplicate things. I like to think cats evolved to be more and more highly sensitive overall, so even your average cat is a distrustful little fucker compared to dogs ; P that's just my take though, not science. It can be difficult to deal with since it makes it easy for trivial events to blow up to hugely complicated struggles in your head, like 'do I go first or not'. People with normal sensitivity levels aren't as prone to over-analysis and a rush of emotions like that. There's a flipside, though: studies have shown that highly sensitive persons, if given positive influences, ALSO process these very deeply, and actually achieve more with it. A harsh bit of criticism can stick in your mind for a long time, but all the same, HSP's are more likely to take positive advice or interesting ideas to heart, and truly think them through in order to get something good out of it. It's been conceptualised as vantage sensitivity. If your environment sucks, you're going to suffer the consequences more heavily in terms off stress and negative feelings, but if your environment has opportunities in it, you're going to spot them and take advantage of them more, too. For me, being highly sensitive kind of worked against me as a child. Even if my parents tried to protect me from their adult worries, I picked up on a lot of implicit negativity and internalised it. I knew my mom was stressed out over me having problems in school, and instead of just shrugging it off and playing with friends I spent a lot of time just pondering that and feeling bad about it. Early stressors can make highly sensitive people more anxious pretty easily. Some useful handholds can also give them the tools they need to get back up and improve their lives. Note how you didn't just superficially read some feelsy-goodsy books to cover up how you felt, you spotted advice you felt you could do something with and actually used it to good effect. Heck yeah on that, it's awesome you got the courage together to go 'fuck it, I'm gonna try this'. I've also gotten a lot better, I still have bleh days and I don't think I'll have as many spoons in my daily life as some people, but at least I feel growth is possible and I can move forward towards the things I want rather than feel like I'm trapped being helpless and weak. "
d08z6n,Almost had a panic attack in nyc while high last night. I smoked a joint by myself last night and as I was walking back fo my apartment I felt the high coming on and my heart started racing. I realized I was experiencing intense anxiety but I just turned up my music and kept walking. “It’s all in your head” I kept telling myself. The 10 minute walk back to my apartment building felt like it took half an hour.
pedxn9," The relationships I’ve lost. I grew up and I’m average looking. I would say I’m just so shy when it comes to taking to people. I’ve lost friendships Irl I could of had online. You see so many people, your friends from school that you thought where your friends, don’t even follow you back, don’t even want to start the conversation with you. Girls that don’t want to talk with you leaving you on read. I get it, I’m not who I say I am. I’m a person with that should receive respect. Those with big following found a way to be confident and not give a fuk what people said and just did them. Over looking at yourself, your minor mistakes are bad. Perfection isn’t key. So I made a snap story to my 7 friends on there which isn’t even a lot. I don’t know who’s going to read this because I even get anxiety from what I post. That something bad is going to happen. I listen to so much music and it helps. Until you can accept where you are and find out what you wanna do. Believe in your self. Look in the mirror say you got this. You can win. It takes a lot to be more social. Well we all can do this. I’ve been dealing with this for years. I’ve lost irl relationships. I could of been famous. That’s how you become famous, those with social anxiety, they’re the ones that don’t get ahead. Well let me… I’m a begginer at using my voice. Just I feel like that if it wasn’t for the environment I would of been set out what i was destined to do. It’s not to late. I’m 19. Join that club, join what you got to do to meet people. Say hello, don’t fear rejection. Go for a walk, get your thoughts settled, drink plenty of water, rest, mediate. Those are all something I want to do more of. Dealing with school, dealing with work, dealing with people, you just got to believe. I believe in you and everybody. I hope I find light under the tunnel. No friends hitting me up. It’s been my social anxiety. Not able to make people want me. You got to say you can do it and make people want you. Just I’ve been around the block. How am I supposed to get over good people I lost on the way of my life ? Plenty of fish in the sea. But if your shy it’s ok. You too can make friends. We got this king and queens. "
eks59dk,"For me, I think it has to do with my mom being so socially anxious (she primarily raised me and my siblings). She is super ""shy"". She even writes out eveything she's going to say on the phone before a phone call. So might be somewhat of a genetic/environment type deal. Also, I think just being a little more neurotic than the average person doesn't help. And, hating what I looked like as a teen definitely impacted the self esteem. Looking back, the social anxiety started around puberty when I'd avoid busy streets when biking to the pool because of a fear of people seeing me awkwardly waiting at stop lights. High school dances were never pleasant. Cue eating disorder at 15, social isolation from basically 18 to 24. Perfect storm for some severe social anxiety."
sfcvob," What physical symptoms do you get?. For me it’s usually being very tense when I’m out walking around/doing tasks in public places, to the point that I probably look robotic in how I move. Also back pain, shortness of breath, etc. "
e0ul7kw," I read your post about dreaming too. Sounds like you have a lot of emotion inside you, lots of hopes and dreams, but your anxiety is getting in the way. I'm the same, there's lots of us out there. It's hard to explain to people that don't suffer from anxiety and depression. The two work together to create an extremely debilitating condition that is sometimes, without help, too much for our will to overcome. You have to understand it's not YOU that's the problem, it's this illness that wants nothing but to harm you. And you have to fight it with all you've got. If you sulk around in your home you're just letting it win. Being out in public felt so strange and uncomfortable because your illness doesn't like those environments. It would prefer you stay at home so it can slowly consume you without distraction. Do you enjoy alcohol? I'm obviously not going to recommend you drink your troubles away but it can be a very useful tool just to get yourself out there and socialize a little. If I lived by the ocean I would go out and enjoy it too. Also you know two languages which is kind of cool. Do you speak Spanish? I've been trying to learn Spanish for a long ass time "
paj6pk," As a boy with this stupid disease, It's mentally painful and embarrassing living in a society with stereotypes of men being tough, or bold.. It's not like I'm transgender, or hate my gender or anything. I like being a male, not in a sexist way but I just like who I am. But what bothers me is when I see tough males being portrayed as loud, hanging out or drinking beer with friends, and being able to take insults and fight back. I have no friends, and Im too scarred to go outside in fear of just our neighbors being on their porch. I also have this weird thing where im uncomfortable around other males but I feel fine with females. It's really strange. Anyways thats my vent. Thanks for reading. "
kwqhkt, Is an empty head a healthy one?. I'm finally learning how to let go of my worried thoughts and just be in the moment. I realized that when i get in this state my head gets completely empty. It's like i didn't have a brain. Only body and instinct controlling my actions. And that feels awesome. I saw a hot girl walking on the street and went outside to walk my dog just so she could notice me. Just like a normal man would do. If i were listening to my troubled head i would have stayed inside watching her like a creep. Maybe the cure for us is to just be dumb enough to not worry about anything? 
siw59f,"I (23M) recently reached some sort of breaking point and went on my first spontaneous date/hookup and it went surprisingly well. Really long story ahead but it covers a bunch of issues I struggle with (SAD, AvPD, insecurity about looks, maybe even body dysmorphia, not dressing how or doing what I want out of some subconscious fear of ""expections"" others have, alcohol, loneliness, craving deep connections with people, body contact, not seeing yourself in a relationship...) so maybe others can relate. I guess I also just like writing long posts lmao. The middle section has a TLDR at the end. I’ve never dated, had a boyfriend or been intimate with a man (or other person in general), I basically also had no friends for most of my life post-childhood. I was bullied a lot as kid and I’ve had social anxiety since I was about 12 and probably have avoidant personality disorder too (r/avpd), though I don’t care much about the labels. I didn’t know about AvPD until recently and reading some of the experiences of others the past few weeks has been eye-opening and incredibly helpful at identifying what’s wrong with my life. I've basically been living in a self-made prison half my life (as I've seen somebody write) and ""social anxiety"" only covers some of the experiences and issues I have, I feel. Perhaps this story fits better into r/avpd because I feel like folks over here actually often turn out to have partners and be married and such, which always baffled me (before learning I probably have more than SAD). But then I also don’t want to minimize having a personality disorder, guess I’m overthinking things again. Not sure why I'm even sharing this story - I guess to share something positive, to show that most of our worries and insecurities are totally made-up, and that we are actually capable of doing the same things as most people? My life has been a complete mess up until now (because of SAD/AvPD) with no sign of improvement until recently, so if it seems like I managed to do this because I only have “mild” SA or something, that’s totally wrong and I wouldn’t mind sharing more about my life and experiences in the comments. I basically spent my entire teenage years and then my student years alone in my bedroom with zero human interaction outside of school hours, no exaggeration. I guess I’ll get to the story. Again, there's a TLDR at the end of the middle section. ____________________ I've been studying in this city for almost 3 years, because of covid I haven't been there often - I've basically been homebound since March 2020, except for some lab work and exams. It's not like I would have done much anyway because of my SA (and likely AvPD), so I would have regretted not doing anything during this period regardless of the pandemic. Last week my last exam took place and after finishing it I realised this would officially be the last ""relaxed"" night in the city and in my studio before packing and leaving, which hit me kinda hard - I basically regret my entire life, I regret not doing anything, I regret turning down invitations, I regret not meeting people or not getting closer to the people I met, and this also applies to the last 3 years. So many missed opportunities to do things or become friends with people I feel I’d get along with. This regret has only been growing with the years (fueled by 2 years of near-total isolation because of covid and losing some loved ones), and the last few weeks I've been thinking *a lot* about my life (and I've started doing therapy again). I went my entire life believing I’m an extreme introvert but the last few months/years I’ve started to seriously question that (and many other things about my life). Anyway, I prepared a nice meal after my last exam, picked a good movie and opened up the bottle of wine I had bought a couple of weeks earlier, I guess for this occasion. When I'm a bit tipsy/drunk (2-3 glasses of wine and I only do this once every few months, don't worry) all my anxieties and insecurities go away and I feel mostly happy, it's as if this self-made prison in which I otherwise live just vanishes. I think this was actually part of the process of realising I'm not who I've fooled myself into thinking I am. I only drink by myself though and I did it for the first time rather recently, I think out of some kind of fear of what I would say/do around people that I otherwise wouldn’t. I’m sure that if I drank around others I’d just be a “normal”, social person. As I had done often before (just to look around with an empty profile) I downloaded Grindr. I got chatting with this normal looking guy who texted me first, and he eventually convinced me to sent a photo of myself. That might not sound like a big deal, but I hate being in photos and how I look and as a result basically no photos of me exist after the age of 13 or so - I have never uploaded a photo of myself to facebook or something either. It was a selfie I took a couple weeks earlier in a new outfit I haven't dared to wear yet, because it’s not what I usually wear or some other stupid reason - my wardrobe if full of things I like but have never worn. I actually thought I looked decent in the photo (at least conscious/rational me thinks so if that makes sense). He said I was cute, had nice eyes and had no reason to be so insecure/anxious (which I again consciously believe, I jus't don't *feel* that way). Despite my lackluster social skills I'm pretty good at reading people and I felt this guy was ""safe"", and I was just so lonely and deprived of affection (or just human interaction in general, I'm not very close with my family and hadn't seen my only two friends in weeks), that I asked him if it was OK if I came over just to talk/cuddle. He said that sounded great and that he was too tired for more anyway, which I assured him wasn't a problem as I wasn't interested in anything sexual (for real, I was just looking for company). I still can't believe I did this but I brushed my teeth, got dressed, hopped on my bike and went over to his place. By this point I was actually fully sober again - the biggest and hardest steps (sending the photo, putting myself out there, setting a date) had already been taken. He was waiting at the entrance of his dorm and we went to his room. I immediately felt comfortable and at ease around him which is fairly exceptional, he just had that vibe I guess. I feel inferior or intimated (not sure what the best word is) around maybe 95% of men around my age so I guess I had some luck there. Perhaps I also just reached some kind of breaking point where the regret and loneliness got bigger than the anxiety and things holding me back, or maybe it was still the wine. We talked for about an hour, I actually opened up about my anxiety, how this was my first time meeting a guy and so on. Though he couldn’t believe why a guy like me would be anxious he could actually relate because he was like that as a teenager (or so he said), and he was extremely supportive - he also complimented my eyes, hair, body and some other features and he was totally genuine about it (again, I consciously believe these things and tell myself them, I just don't *feel* it). I'm actually mostly good at one-on-one conversations I think, it's when more people are involved that I completely freeze up. Eventually he asked if it was OK if he me gave me a hug (which I hadn't dared to ask yet), I said yes and oooh boy. A couple days prior I actually wrote in my diary that I could never see myself having a relationship or being sexual/intimate with someone, and that because I’ve been single my entire life everyone just “knows” me as the single guy so I’m “supposed” to be single or something I guess. It just didn’t seem like something for me or that I could see myself doing or initiating. The rare times I’m out in public by myself and I see others with friends, a partner or family, everything seems to come so “naturally” to them and it seems like they don’t care at all about what’s happening around them and that *hurts* and always gives me an overwhelming negative feeling. But I’ll continue now… What followed was a whole lot of firsts over the course of two hours (though we stayed fully dressed) and I'm honestly shocked I did the things I did. From basic hugging to gently touching and kissing each other, to staring in each other's eyes uninterruptedly for minutes, to tickling each other and eventually french kissing, then the same things but laying down facing each other. It was wild and honestly felt like a dream afterwards, I genuinely have never felt as good as that night and the hormones that got released had me smiling for days. Mind you, I’ve never been physical with people like this, even my family was/isn’t really big on hugs or anything (though they're good people). He never did anything without asking or me making clear it was OK and I felt like we actually got some chemistry going on, so I have zero regrets this happened with him (and not with a first actual boyfriend). I was extremely awkward and passive at first (and couldn’t maintain eye contact for more than 10 seconds or so at the start) but by the end was doing most of the things he did. Eventually it got really late (or early), we hugged each other goodbye and I went home. For me this was a one-time thing (I’m leaving the city anyway) and for him this was a casual thing he does regularly with different dudes (as he had already told me at the start), so that was it. **TLDR**: I've been extremely lonely and isolated my entire life, especially the last two years. It was my last day in a city as a student, I had huge regrets about never doing anything, never meeting anyone and never getting close to people (this had been going on for months/years), and had a nice relaxed evening by myself with some wine. I also mentioned some of my avoidant behaviour, insecurities and other thoughts I sometimes have. I downloaded Grindr, sent someone a photo of myself for the first time ever after chatting for a while, met up and we talked and were physically intimate for hours. ______________ I feel kinda bad about writing these things because I don’t want to make anyone jealous or feel bad about themselves, nor do I want to brag lol. But I guess my point is that I had never done anything with another guy for 23 years, was convinced I’d die alone never having even touched a guy and then this just… happened, in the moment, going with the flow. And it was a totally memorable night and not a catastrophic failure. Maybe most people are actually nice, and maybe I’m not as weird, special or incapable as I subconsciously think I am? Perhaps behind that layer of anxiety, insecurity and restraint, there is actually a “normal”, loving person waiting to break free? When looking in the mirror I guess I also *feel* a tiny bit of self-esteem for the first time now, since that night I’ve noticed I just look a bit “different” when looking at myself. I guess I also see myself having a relationship in the not too distant future. Really weird how one experience can change how you feel about yourself, in a positive way for once. It actually really messed with my head for a while, I felt totally attached to him already (which I guess is a normal physical reaction) though I realise now that I’m just so deprived of affection that I got attached to the first person that gave me some - I don’t really get hugs from family either, and then the entire covid situation the past 2 years took away daily interaction with fellow students as well, though that was superficial. I largely still ""feel"" the same internally as before but I actually see myself dating or just meeting new people in general now, which I guess is a huge step forward. I’m not sure how actual dating, having a serious relationship and sharing everything with someone will turn out though, this was just a fun night with no strings attached. My issues haven't just vanished overnight. I guess “just doing things” isn’t going to work as advice for most people (it doesn’t for me either and reading positive experiences here always seems so alien) but I guess I reached some sort of breaking point and I managed to turn it into something positive rather than something negative through a series of fortunate coincidences. I contemplated posting this for a while and might delete it later, but fuck it. I've been thinking a lot about life lately and writing things down is nice."
jz7pyb,"Does anyone else feel like their social anxiety has prevented them from developing hobbies/talent?. Hey all! I am a 25 year old female who has dealt with social anxiety my whole life. As i've gotten older i've started to reflect a lot on my childhood and why I am the way I am and was wondering if anyone else has noticed a similar connection between anxiety and the development of hobbies/talent. As a child my mother literally forced me into every sport and after school activity imaginable. I remember feeling intense dread every time I was enrolled in something new and would beg my mom to let me stay home. All I could think about is the potential to make a mistake and have people judge me or being scared to meet new people and make friends. I didn't realize at the time what I was feeling was anxiety but now I realize how bad my anxiety has been my whole life. Now at 25 I am thankful my mom did force me into those things because i've been able to develop very good social skills and basically appear to other people as if I don't have anxiety at all (despite freaking out in my head). However, I've also noticed that I don't have anything I truly enjoy doing or that i'm good at. For example, I loved volleyball and soccer but all I remember from childhood is being terrified to go to practice or to a game in fear of messing up and people judging me. This applies to every hobby and sport I have ever done. This will sound pathetic but I even remember being 15 and being put into guitar lessons and feeling anxious that the instructor would judge me for not being good. I'm starting to feel intense regret that I have never allowed myself to explore potential talents and get really good at one thing because i've always been so anxious to do anything, despite actually enjoying the hobby itself. I truly admire athletes and people who are so dedicated to what they love to do and I have regrets about how much I have limited myself in life. Can anyone else relate to this? I wish I could back in time knowing what I know now and just enjoy life and stop overthinking literally everything!"
f4ivwld," Exactly, and I hate it because I know it can come off as rude but it’s more over-stimulating than anything. Yeah it sucks:/ we’re always fighting about it and I try to convince him that no other person on the planet would be cool with that and for some reason he continues to blame me for not being able to sleep through it. He also says he’s loud so he can’t say anything to them, but it doesn’t bother/wake them when he’s loud. Unfortunately the floor is pretty bad😔 and he’s pretty heavy. I live in a mobile home and for some reason someone put tile on top of probably poor quality particle board . Very poor decision. So now the toilet area is really sketchy, but I am in the process of having someone come fix it. It’s not fair to say someone’s house is too far, but for them expect you to drive the same distance. It’s give and take, but my bf has been that was as well. It’s frustrating and I’m sorry he doesn’t realize that. Those are really good suggestions 😊thank you! We’ll have to do some of those sometime, especially the hiking because I know I need to be more active. I really appreciate you saying my feelings are valid, and want you to feel the same as well. Thank you for your support! "
eyayfso," My heart feels for you. I'm in the same boat. I'll be 25 soon and still can't figure out my brain and how to stop letting my fears control my life. Not sure if this will help you, but I deal with social anxiety, ADD and OCD. I've found that a lot of my anxiety stems from my inability to focus. When I can't focus I can't address people or my job appropriately, and that just amps up the anxiety levels even more. When my psychiatrist recommended Adderall I was skeptical since it's a stimulant, but it actually helped me in more ways than one. My focus increased, my energy increased, my anxiety diminished a bit. No, it didn't go away entirely, but it has helped in some ways. I've also found that Adderall with a tinnny bit of Xanx also helps. It's what I'll take before a big event where I know I'm going to be a mess. It just helps me feel a little bit more normal. A little bit more in control. Next, EXERCISE. I know, it's literally the last thing you want to think about. But seriously. Do it. I love to swim, or even just go on a long walk. It works your pent up anxiety OUT. My biggest struggle has been just accepting that... this is how I am. Kind people will not judge you for being awkward with them. They will have enough empathy to see past your weird quirks and see who you really are. The essence of you... I'm a new teacher, and I have a lot of anxiety around parent communication. While many parents aren't helpful or kind, there are those few in every class who go out of their way to be kind to me. Those kinds of people are the only people worth having in your life. Those are the kind worth wasting your energy on. Lastly, your anxiety isn't you. It is the monster hanging onto your back and weighing you down. See it as that.Something separate from yourself. It isn't you. It shouldn't define you. When you have those negative thoughts direct them at that anxiety monster and not yourself.... haha I hope that made some ounce of sense. I hope this helped in some way. Please know that YOU ARE NOT ALONE. I'm struggling with you... but one day we will find peace. You are not a lost cause. &lt;3 "
g8y3hj4," Yes I get the neck thing ahaha , I’m scared to take medication :/ but I might try it I’m that desperate. I hate life at the moment . I feel fine when I wake up , but as soon as I start to get ready to leave the house I get dizzy and dissociate, when I walk outside I feel so overwhelmed and get dizzy and anxious , and in class I get so uncomfortable, hot , sweaty and dizzy. I can’t do it anymore. I don’t have the typical thoughts of social anxiety , but I did get billed when I was younger so maybe it’s in my subconscious mind ? "

clzwak," Anxious about a trip coming up. So I (22) am currently with my girlfriend (22) of about a year in Malaysia, which is basically on the other side of the world from where I come from in the UK. I have been pretty anxious about coming out here for a while since it is a big step to stay with her parents and even more scary thinking about how I will tackle social events with my girlfriends group of friends. She has a lot of friends varying in closeness and personality. I have to admit that I am yet to properly become relaxed with any of them, which is perhaps more down to not having met them that much as I stay at home a lot. The trip ill be taking here that I am worried about is one in which I will be going to stay with a group her friends in a villa 20-30 minutes away. On paper it should be good fun in that we will probably be going to the beach, having a nice meal and generally relaxing. However the stress that I have about it is that I am not really good with large groups of people. I also find some of her friends kind of intimidating, which I know is silly, but I always feel kinda like the goofy white boy who doesn't really get asian culture and doesn't match their patter/confidence. With this being said, one of the things that would be prevalent for young people to do in the uk is have social drinks in order to take the edge off of social situations and perhaps become a little more easy going when chatting. I know that alcohol is not a good solution to social anxiety, but in this situation, my girlfriend does not think it is a thing for people to have drinks and hangout especially among her group of friends. I do not know these friends and staying with them makes me think I will be struggling for social energy as I can become very drained from the anxiety. On the one hand I really just want some sort of crutch to keep the anxiety at bay and relax a bit with a beer or two but on the other hand I know that I should may be try to embrace a different way of doing things and get over the fear. This is just part of the dilemma I am facing as in my mind, she is comfortable to be with all her friends and does not understand my issue, and I am being put into the deep end of my anxiety. I really don't want to avoid it all together or make up an excuse as I want to make the effort for her and do the right thing. I just really worry that I will be awkwardly sitting at the side, staring into space or quietly responding to them while everyone catches up and connects. Seeing people easily chatting away makes me kind of mad at myself for not having that kind of social fluidity. I just hope to fit in and I am still unsure if I ever will. Any tips for this kind of event would be greatly appreciated and apologies for the slight rant/tangent. TL;DR In my GFs hometown in Asia and going on a trip with her friends. Not sure how to cope with the large group that I am staying with at a villa. "
f310tqs,"You're not alone. I'm 17 and still don't know how to cook, wash my clothes, order for myself, I don't even know most of street names and venues in my small hometown that I have to ask someone (not strangers) before taking a taxi. The thing is, I'm gonna have to move out to a bigger city (or even go abroad) next year since there are no colleges/unis in here. I'm so not ready for the outside world."
g21lg2c,"I don't remember an exact age but I do remember doing things that felt normal to me. Here are some of the situations: 1. My mom asked me if I could get her a coffee. I declined because ""people would think that I was buying that for myself and because I was a kid they would judge me and probably get me in trouble for buying coffee."" 2. I would not scold my dog when he would randomly stop and not move while on a walk. Why? Because ""people will think I am abusing my dog or something and that I am a bad person."" 3. I was eating lunch at my school cafeteria with my mom after school had ended. There were two girls sitting across me and they suddenly started laughing. I asked my mom if they were laughing at me because I though they were laughing because she was with me. 4. My mom took a photo of me and two of my ""friends"". When I saw the picture I told her how if people saw it they would probably make fun of me because I was in a very weird pose. 5. I have always felt weird about blowing my nose, sneezing or coughing in public and tend to avoid it. 6. Sometimes when me and my mom would pass through McDonalds, I would ask if I could get something from there. If she said ""Sure, I'll give you money so you can go get yourself something"" I would just say ""You know what, nevermind"". 7. If I heard that someone was at home (mom's friend for example) I would try to stay at my room. 8. If I was experiencing some type of inconvenience (hungry, cold, hot, etc.) I would not say anything because I didn't want to ""burden"" people. 9. I wouldn't really say my opinion or for example if I knew something (like and answer to a question) in fear of saying something wrong or people judging me. 10. Answering doors/answering or making calls was usually a no-no. 11. I felt pretty anxious if I was late to school. 12. I would usually check my stuff every day so I don't forget anything. So I basically had to say keys, phone, water, money, etc. a couple of times to make sure I had everything. I even had to say things like clothes, hair, shoes to make sure I am absolutely ready. I also constantly checked if stuff like my phone/bus card were there. 13. Going to the store huh? Before you go to the cashier you gotta take out your money and while waiting in line you have to count it like 20 times to make sure it's the right amount. You already counted it? Doesn't hurt to do it once more. Oh and if you have a list of items you gotta check them like 10 times too. Oh and when you get your change make sure you get the hell out of there as quickly as possible. I was a shy kid(still not very social lol), so some of these could be out of pure shyness, but however I did fear the judgement of other people so I think I can count those situations as ""signs of SA, but not quite SA yet"" since it didn't affect my daily life much. P.S. This comment took 25 minutes of reading and constantly editing to fix mistakes and add stuff. So, I hope it was relatable and that it was at least somewhat close to the answer you were looking for haha"
dfypm09, Weed makes me more anxious when stuck around people but if I'm alone or outside walking in nature listening to music I always get so relaxed. I could be in a really bad mood or sad but after smoking I get super mellow and it silences the chaos in my over analytic brain for the rest of the day. 
nkakot,I Don’t Understand. Some background info before I get in to it. I just turned 25 and I’ve struggled with social anxiety ever since high school. It was much worse back then but I’ve been able to keep it under control for the most part with therapy and medication. I still get pretty anxious but I can bear with it. So I met this girl on a dating app and we’ve been talking and things seemed to be going pretty well. I find out we have a lot in common like she’s introverted and has anxiety too. I met her at a park to walk my dogs with her and I thought things went pretty well. I was the one that kept the conversation going and asked questions. I felt like I was doing a great job of being outgoing and talkative. She even let me kiss her at the end and she seemed physically in to me. After the date though she didn’t seem interested and her texts were short to me. I asked her what’s wrong and she said “I wasn’t feeling a good vibe and I don’t think we mix well because we’re both shy and introverted”. She told me she wants someone more outgoing...yet she’s introverted and shy like myself. I thought I was doing a great job of coming out of my shell and being more outgoing. It hurt getting told I was still “too quiet” and “not outgoing enough”. I can’t help I’m a soft spoken person. I really thought I was doing well. The fact that another introvert with social anxiety tells me I’m not outgoing enough and too quiet stings. Is there no hope? I try to make effort and I was the one initiating all of the conversation. It feels like everyone wants someone more outgoing and assertive even if they’re shy and introverted themselves. Anyone else experience something like this? I’m just really down on myself because I thought I was doing a great job of hiding my social anxiety and being outgoing.
djgu3zd,"Absolutely. Some days all I want to do is go for a walk around my city. Like a really fucking long walk, where I won't get home for hours"
htk48h,"Social Anxiety within work. Okay so I have a lot to vent about so it might not even make grammatical sense since I’m typing as I’m thinking but please bare with me :( I am the youngest in my workplace. I graduated from college at 18 and got recruited by my work as soon as I graduated. Then at 19, I finally moved to London for my job. I’ve dealt with regular anxiety for a while now but as soon as I moved into the UK, it just went downhill. Maybe it’s because I am an asian girl, but I never felt like I fit in with all these people starring at me and especially with the whole pandemic. Anyway that’s just my background for my story. Here’s the thing: my colleagues and the company I work for are very nice people and do not seem to have any problem with me. Which is why I am so frustrated with myself. I am a very quiet worker and a type of person who likes to get my job done quickly and efficiently. I don’t have anyone I dislike at work (other than my manager he really intimidates me) and I genuinely have no problem with my colleagues. But the thing is, all of them have constantly pointed out that I am really quiet and ask if something’s wrong (Which is so fuckingn annoying lmao), WHEN THATS JUST HOW I AM. But because everyone at work except me is so extroverted and all friends with each other (I am the newest member, everyone has been together for at least a year), I feel excluded and feel like they don’t like me because I am quiet and don’t like to talk with them much. When I do talk with them I make sure I am always smiling and listening attentively and make sure I’m polite. Since this pandemic has started, my manager and team members constantly wanna zoom call each week AND I FUCKING HATE IT. I always dread phone calls and dread having to take out time from MY DAY to have small talks, that I don’t even want, facing all my colleagues through the phone. I’ve tried a couple of times to pull out saying I’m doing something else, but since it’s too obvious that I don’t wanna call if I do this too much, I join the calls. The thing is, these calls aren’t mandatory which drives me fucking insane. Like I constantly feel like if I refuse to join these calls, everyone would think im “not a team player”, but at the same time why bother joining if there’s nothing important???? I piss myself off everyday and my brain has literally gone bonkers. One time during the zoom call, my manager lightly suggested we have a BBQ party altogether since we can’t go to work, and everyone else was all like “Yea totally! Let’s do that”. I stayed silent. After the call I literally started freaking out over this. Omg do I HAVE to go outside and SOCIALIZE with them now?! When I just joined and have no close colleagues?! That was all I was thinking. Then for the next TWO WEEKS, all I was thinking about was if I should go to the BBQ or not. I started CRYING somedays cuz it just blew up in my brain the fact that I would have to socialize and also cuz I got frustrated with myself of why I have to freak out over something so deemed as normal. The thing is, the BBQ didn’t even happen and it was just something lightly tossed in incase the colleagues were bored at home. I really wanna be professional since now I am in the adult working world, but it’s just so hard when nobody at work would understand what I am going through. I feel as if they are very shallow and would not understand a thing about mental health since all of them seem to be so happy working together. They really intimidate me in that aspect for some reason. I even tried searching on google “do i have to join non mandatory social events at work” but all of the answers were up in the air. Maybe it’s because I am the youngest (JUST turned 20) out of all of these adults (in between the ages of 25-55) but I don’t even see any topics we can relate to. Also I am like a literal korean weeb, the only asian whose interests lie in tiktok and shit my generation is interested in (kpop, anime, fashion, whatever u can think of that gen z is interested in) while the rest of them are all sophisticated, white adults who wanna “chill together over a beer” or “go out to the pub”. Like POLAR OPPOSITES. Maybe that’s why I feel so uncomfortable with them??? Idk but they are wayyy too talkative and extroverted. All of them in our groupchat keep saying things like “omg I cannot wait to go back to work and see you all” or “i miss working”, and I’m just like..... No ❤️ I seriously don’t know how I’m going to cope with work when the lockdown is over. Somebody please help me :("
dcwkjnc,"Yeah, I do the same, I can't pee while being around others guys, I can't... and sometimes even when I'm in a bathroom stall, if I heard too much the guy next to me, I can bother me and so I can't pee...nnIt has been a problem for me especially twice, one time when I was peeing next to a guy I know, I had to hear him leaving the place so I would be able to pee, and another time, I was doing some mountain bike with a guy and I had to tell him to go ahead on the track so I would be alone and be able to pee... (btw, it was 1 year and half ago, and it was the last time I went to a mountain bike hiking with someone else (I knew from an internet forum), even if it's a true hobby for me, since then I only made completly alone hiking, even if it pushed me in very hard situations sometimes, like being alone surounded by 10 dogs in the mountains with only a small pepper spray to defend myself... hopefully nothing bad happened, but that was some hard times, and that's how I live with my SA....)n"
6b466z," My body keeps going into fight or flight state when alone with girls, i am completely losing it :(. Hello guys, I'm REALLY sorry for the long post and for my bad english, i'm kinda desperate at the moment and you guys might be my only help. I am 22 years old and it all started since I got released from the army half a year ago. I admit I never had the courage to walk up to a girl at the bar and start a chat, always felt like i'm really ugly, but as time passed I've started to build my confidence, and the fact that I had girls flirting with me also gave me a confidence boost aswell, as for today I have no problems whatsoever having a conversation with girls I know such as from my work, friends of friends, etc, I guess it only happens while i'm alone with her, outside of where we usually meet like work. my first encounter was a few months ago, where I've gained some confidence and sent a message to a girl on Instagram telling her lets go for a trip (she loves motorcycles which I own), she said alright and I went to her and picked her up and took her to some place something like a motorcyclists meet up spot, and out of nowhere in a matter of seconds my stomache just completely lost it and I REALLY needed to go, it was so urgent I lied to her that my mom was involved in a car accident and I'll be back in half an hour and I just left her there and drove as fast as I could to my house, and ran up to the toilet, the weird thing is half way to my home I almost couldn't hold it anymore, and when I finally got home I didn't really have to go that bad but I did, after I went I felt so much relief and went back to her, we continued to a bar and once again out of the blue my stomache completely lost it and im lucky the bar had a toilet and I just ran there as fast as I could as I almost couldn't hold it anymore, after going in I felt a relief for the rest of the day. I thought it was just bad luck, since I was really hungover from yesterday's night drinking. a month has elapsed and my friend invited me to go with up and sit with 2 of his female friends at the bar, so I agreed and we went with our bikes to their house to pick them up, on our way there I just to stop like 5 times to pee, we picked them up and went to the bar, after sitting at the bar for like 10 minutes my brain just went into ""down"" mode, started feeling locked and then felt like im about to throw up, so I told them I'll be right back and went to the bathroom, and as far as I've gained distance from our table my nausea has reliefed and I didnt have to throw up and more so I decided to go back to the table, went there and sat for like 5 minutes, having good time, laughing, and then all of a sudden my brain does it again, and once again, out of the blue my stomache is going insane and I just had to literally run to the bathroom because I couldn't hold it for much long, it was really urgent. I thought once again, bad luck, maybe something I ate or I don't know, just bad luck. a few months has elapsed and my REALLY good friend (and ridiculously beautiful I might add) invited me to her place for the weekend, I know her really well, she served with me in the army and we mostly spent most of our time together in the army, so shes no stranger to me, I can't even count the hours we sat together in our base. she lives 4 hours away from me in a well known tourism town so I said why not, lets meet up with her, go to the local bars and just have some really fun time, sounds like a good plan, or atleast I thought. on the night before going to her I could barely get some sleep, I was nervous, but I thought its because of the long drive ahead of me, so the next day came, and I went out to her, when I met her I felt really weird, my brain started locking up again, and I was really embarrased from her parents and my stomache started acting up again so I had to go without anyone noticing, and I started feeling nausea again. and this point I realized something is off, and third time bad luck is too much, and I've started to realize that maybe its anxiety and my body is going into fight or flight state because its pretty much it's symptoms (nausea and having to go to the bathroom feeling). so I spent the entire weekend in fight or flight state, I barely ate anything the entire weekend, nausea and having to go the bathroom just came and went all the time, I went to the bathroom like 30 - 40 times during the past few days even if there was little to none to let out, but when that feeling came, I just had to run to the bathroom and felt nausea and my brain just locks up. on the first night we went out to the bar from some heavy drinking, and after I got drunk I've noticed im finally out of fight or flight state, feeling absolutley free and I've had the time of my life, laughing, dancing, just really enjoying everything, I thought its finally over but the next morning after the alcohol effect were gone I were back in that state. seems like alcohol solved it but I don't want to become an alcoholic just to live a normal life, thats no solution. So why is this happening to me? why I just wanna go out and have some good time and my body just keeps saying NO and messes up everything for me? i'm really scared of getting the thought that this is my life now, and that I'm bound to live a lonely life because I'll never be able to go out with a girl without having to be stuck in that awful state. forgot to mention I never were in a relationship (I don't consider my gf at the age of 13 lol), but I did have a few one night stands and had good time even thought I was stressed during the act. I could really use any kind of help because I'm really scared that its going to get worse and worse and I don't want anyone who knows me to know about that. Thanks in advanced for any sort of help "
ouyd9y,"I'm just fed up in general lol. I used to try and speak to people in discord servers and stuff like a year ago but I couldn't do it and always ended up just leaving but I thought maybe it'd be easier now because I noticed that the past few times I've gone outside with my mum I've not been scared at all even though I'm usually really nervous even just leaving the house. Turns out I don't find it any easier nowadays though lol I been debating if I should even bother trying at this point in time. in some ways I've gotten a lot better like I used to not even be able to post a YouTube comment when I was young that's how bad it was and like I'm happy I've improved but I feel like I never improve enough. Im still not getting any better when it comes to having actual conversations with people I don't already know and I can't fix it. It also doesn't help that I haven't been in school since I was 11 (I'm 15) so I never end up in situations where I'm forced into conversation which is what everyone days helps best lol. In fact it was because of how socially anxious I am that I couldn't even get through my first year of high school before I asked to be taken out. Idk if I regret it or not because on one hand school was so stressful and I was not myself at all but also it means I lost any friends I did have and I feel like I'm missing out on one of the most basic experiences that teenagers are supposed to have (being in school) and I feel like it's so much harder when I have to educate myself than it is having a teacher do it. all this because I'm too anxious :/ lol I've always been like this for as long as I remember too so idk if its possible to fix it anymore. my mum and nan think it's because of my dad (he was not very nice and he left us but nothing too bad) but I really don't think it is because I rarely think of him which they say its because I'm doing it subconsciously but I just feel like they just have a hard time understanding that most likely nothing caused it I just am this way for some reason lol. if anyone has any advice other than stuff like ""just speak to people"" that will be great (because for some reason everyone thinks that will fix it even though half the problem is the fact that I have no where to meet anyone bc I don't go to school and I'm not allowed to just wander around outside nor do I want to). Do you guys think I should try and speak in discord servers again or just leave it and hope I get into college and meet people there lol"
mz1dif,"A kid smiled at me today. Today I was out in public, just grocery shopping, hanging around in somewhat busy places and walking past cars. If you have social anxiety like me, these stuff probably is a struggle for you. But today was different for me. Why? Preparation. I watched a guy on youtube who said that people have a very close minded approach when it comes to medication for social anxiety. Pills change your brain chemistry, but so does exercise and the cold. So first thing I did in the morning was eating a breakfast, then doing a short workout (just 3 sets of biceps curls). After that I did Proggressive muscle relaxation which is a time tested method to reduce Anxiety. After my workout I took a cold shower which I feel is energyzing and relaxing at the same time. That morning routine takes quite a while (90min). But first of all, listen, I am not a little shy or reserved, no. At my best I can not be myself and at my worst, I am making a total fool of myself. So it is probably worth it. But this routine also consists of things I would have to do later the day anyway, like showering and eating. Breathing. I used to find that tip somewhat dumb and viewed it more as a meme than anything else, definetly not as something that can help significantly. But when I saw the look on my therapists face after telling her that I don't really do deep breathing, I realized that this is something I need to pick up. So yeah, I am pretty new to using Breathing as relaxation technique. But after 2 days of trying it out I think that every anxious situations should start with a big breath. I have this hypothesis that Breathing works even better when you practise Progressive muscle relaxation, because Breathing makes your muscles more likely to unflex. Stopping antagonistic energy. When I am anxious, I have a lot of antagonistic energy towards people on the street. I can't really control it directly, because this is the fight or flight response for anxiety. But what I can do is to try to think positive about people I see on the street and just give them as less antagonistic energy as possible. What happened today was really cool. A kid looked at me and was not disturbed/ anxious/ whatnot but kind of smiled at me. This never happens to me although I am outside a lot. Walking slowly and listening to relaxing music. I think that in all of my most recent good experiences I just purposely took things slow. Slow walk, slow melodic music will maybe lead to slower thinking. And that is I think kind of a good thing. Just take a slow breathe and just slow down, my friend. I guess it is common sense that this is a good idea? I want to recommend you guys a youtube chanel I found: [It is a guy who used to have social anxiety himself and he was able to overcome it and become extremely confident. I am not absolutely sure, but I think he also studied clinical psychology. Many of his videos are clickbait where I just think oh god, what bs is coming now. But when I watch it, it makes a whole lot of sense. For example in a video on how to beat social anxiety he says that what beats social anxiety is ultimately your wish to overcome it, that will ultimately lead to you initiating change. I really like this approach, just taking a step back. The support means much to me, you guys acknowledging my posts and giving tips is really something that I find motivating. Btw I am a 20 year old male and my main focus in life is to beat social anxiety. If you have any thoughts, question, tips, feel free to comment, I appreciate and now I will just play a videogame and be happy about my good day."
dlmz0by,"Thank you for relating to me, it's very comforting that you can! You're brave to go camping by yourself! My anxiety already thought of 20 different scenarios that can go wrong LOL definitely kudos to you. And yeah a lot of people on reddit feels the same way you describe it about having more anxiety in groups. For me, I think since I'm so timid, I need a buffer or a push in a group. I feed off people's energy which is clearly bad for me lol but you raise a good perspective about remaining anonymous. Come to think about it, looking back my experience, I kinda like that thought, never thought of it like that. I guess I can use that for next time. Thank you! And yeah I am not into drugs or alcohol lol I want to conquer things solely on my ability."

6knkfm," Asked a girl on tinder if she wants to go out for a drink, she said yes, now I'm freaking out.. So yeah. I'm 27/m with no dating experience whatsoever. I don't have hardly any friends and don't go out much, so I decided to give online dating a shot. We matched on tinder yesterday and texted a little, and this morning I just asked if she wanted to go have a drink sometime. She replied that she'd love to. And now I'm freaking the fuck out lol. I'm quite clueless as to what to do next. Fuck social anxiety. Any advice is appreciated. edit: AFTERMATH UPDATE: Back. Not really sure a whole new thread is in order since there is not a whole lot to say. There was a lot of awkward moments, but shit, I have to start somewhere right? We hugged when we met, talked about simple things like work and where we grew up, etc.. We played a game of pool. It got to a point where it stagnated a bit after about an hour with nothing really left to talk about. At this point I wanted to suggest we go outside, but it was raining like hell outside :/, so we couldn't really. We said our goodbyes, hugged, then left. In hindsight, I probably could've picked a better place instead of a dive bar. Also, I kind of just winged it, but wasn't very good at thinking of topics to talk about. I felt pretty shitty when she would ask what my interests were and what I do for fun since I didn't really have much to say. I'm not like a super interesting person and I rarely leave the house, so I don't really have a whole lot to talk about. I was actually not anxious at all after we started talking. Then later on, I felt disappointed in myself for being so god damn boring. I guess I can't blame myself too much since it was kind of a blind date and didn't discuss much in texting beforehand. I apologized for being awkward, and she said it was ok, but I could tell she wasn't really that comfortable. So as awkward of a date it was, I'm still happy I decided to do it and just consider it practice. I never dated before so I can't expect too much. If you guys have any questions about specifics, I'll try to answer. TLDR: Date was awkward as fuck, mostly just talked, but happy I did it as practice. "
icb0uo,"How do you get through the embarrassing physical signs of SA?. I've seen many posts about how a lot of your SA has gotten worse since quarantine but is it as bad as mine? I am worried I've become agoraphobic because I have no reason to go out anymore and no desire to do anything where I'd go out either. I live with my parents so they provide food and home so I basically just stay in my room all day. I am also 24 btw, not a teenager so I know this isn't normal.  and#x200B; I can't even go for a walk outside with my mom without something happening. Whenever I see an attractive man walking the other direction, towards me, my anxiety skyrockets and I get shaky, can feel my face and neck blushing start and it just kills me; just having my body react. I can't even do the simplest thing like walking past someone anymore without an anxiety attack. I also had an occurrence with my online teaching job where I stumbled over the child's name, felt embarrassed, then suddenly became aware of how hot my room was bc I turned my window unit ac off. I could see in the camera just how red my face was getting and it just kept getting redder. I don't understand why this happened in my job because usually, I can separate the SA from my job since it's not actually in-person.  and#x200B; Just ugh. I would never do anything but I really don't want to live because I feel like if I can't do the simplest little things, there's just no hope for me making a life for myself. This is no way to live to just be couped up in my room all day, hardly talking to people. I want to want to seek help but I don't see myself ever getting to that point. If it were 100% virtual, maybe.  and#x200B; So, in sum I guess for now I want to know how do you get through moments when you feel your physical symptoms of SA coming through?"

dxz7033," If it makes you feel any better, I threw up all over myself during an awards ceremony in front of my entire grade. I then had to shamefully walk down the bleachers as everyone stared at me. I know it’s tough but try to stop over thinking it, those people probably don’t even remember this stuff. Live the moment and stop dwelling on the past. "

fjex4jh," I have no trick to friend making. My advice is just get outside and either talk to someone or if someone talks to you, keep talking. Idk about you, but I’m in college so I literally made a friend by being at the end of a line. She made a comment about the line being long and it went from there. I also think that consistency is a good way to help. I straight up told her ‘hey if you don’t mind I’m just gonna follow you’ (to the row of seats she sat in). We now meet every other morning and sit together in class. "
fn4nydd,I have a similar moment actually. I was also about 13 yo and faceplanted skateboarding and got made fun of by my friend. That stuck with me a while and i wonder if it's contributed to my shyness growing up.
okp06w," On holiday with boyfriend’s family- how do I offer to pay for something?. My boyfriend’s family have invited me on their holiday. I am 17 with no job and any activities/ food for him and his brother are being paid for by the parents. I want to offer to pay for something like a meal since I feel bad for his parents paying for all my activities. They paid for us to go kayaking, golfing, our food etc. How do I politely ask if I can cover the cost of a meal for everyone? What should I say? Or should I wait till I get home and get them a big gift? "
fbxhrqi,"I understand what you mean! But on the other hand - I, for example, am really bad at replying to messages and staying in touch with people, so I can see how people around me could think I don't wanna spend time of them because of that, when it's actually just my anxiety. And people get busy and distracted too, and have their own things to think about.nnIf you really enjoy spending time with someone, and they enjoy it too, they would have no reason to reject your invitation, unless they are genuinely busy, but then you could always reschedule. Taking the first step is scary, but then when they actually accept, you go out together and you enjoy the time you spent together, it will be worth it. nnAs Winnie The Pooh said:nnºYou can't stay in your corner of the Forest waiting for others to come to you. You have to go to them sometimes.¹"
jrlpp0," Can't find anything to talk about. Hey guys and girls, Sorry for the long text below. But I would really really appreciate every help of you assisting me with this problem. I tried to make some paragraph so it's easier to read. I suffer from **social anxiety and depression** since I was 15. Now I'm 21. My doc and I think the social anxiety caused the depression. So here I am now. Anhedonic, dysphoric, bad mood, lack of motivation, drive and appetite. Almost nothing that stimulates me or gives me joy or interest. Additonally my cognition (focus, ability to learn and understand, memory) is very low. I feel disabled and dumb. My self esteem and feeling of self worth is - of course - very low due to this. Well, to the thread: The last months my depression turned worse, like I said, anhedonia and dysphoria rule me right now from the moment I open my eyes in the morning (negative thoughts about my present life, past and future as well as myself as person). It's a lot of psychological pain I experience daily beginning in the morning. What turned kind of better (I don't know how) is my social anxiety. I'm still a mess and unsecure I would say but I definitely see slight improvements. My biggest problem right now is: **I don't know what to talk about.** No topics come to my mind in most cases. I can do small talk with a new person I don't know for example (that's one of the improvements I recognized). But when I would see this person like another few days it goes too much in depth for me. The small talk topics have already being used and not relevant anymore. I feel that the opposite person and myself too don't want to keep superficial small talk. We should get to know each other more at this moment and have flowing conversations with real personal interests and passions. Everything should be more natural by now. Just being open and motivated by nature. Having a good time. Flow again. Keeping the small talk is inapproporiate and boring after more time you know the other person. With the time the more and longer I know the person and the more bounded we are the stronger the **feeling and thoughts of boring the other person and making them know there's not much interesting about me** get. I can't find topics that would interest me or the other person. I mainly do ironic jokes and a lot of bullshit talking (that's just the humour of me and some friends of mine). But damn I get bored by that after short time too and I want to go in more interesting topics and conversations. You know the ones where you just keep talking and me as well my opposite have always something to add to it because they really like talking about it from the heart. The conversations where you get from one topic to another and keep a flow. This just happened to me today at work. I got very well along with a colleague of mine, a cute girl, I worked the third day with now. We laughed a lot, did many jokes, had kind of the same ironic humour. We also talked about topics like university, the work we did of course and where we come from, parents and childhood. It worked well, something I am not always used to. But on the way home through the city I started getting a bit more anxious and thinking too much again. I didn't know what topics to talk about. No topics that would be interesting and target depth and conversation flow. You know, I always compare these conversations I want to learn to have and give with rally at Tennis or Ping Pong. Just a damn flow from the heart. Of course my **depression and social anxiety hinder and restrict me a lot** as mood is low, cognition is bad, anxiety is present. How should I hold interesting conversations if nothing interests me in life? The motivation, stimulation, own passion and interest is not present having these mental health issues. Still I would love to know about your **strategies how to hold such flowing and interesting conversations**, how to **know about interesting topics**, how to **keep the flow and conversation going**. I hope you know what I mean. Is it reading more books, watching series, just learning by doing more socially and gaining social skills? I can't really attempt many social situations this much because of my social anxiety and depression. But I really try to and want to improve myself as every human needs this social life and the love and joy people can bring one. I really miss it. It would make my depression much more bearable. PS. I also have this issues with family members as well as close friends I know for a long time. Like I said I really feel diasbled. Why can't I just be open, talk freely and lose myself? Is my brain really so disabled and dumb? "
g59wkf," I think I’ve lost my sense of self. I (22)F feel off lately. I don’t feel like myself. I feel like I lost myself so much I don’t know if I can find it again. My anxiety is so high with everything I do. I’m becoming more socially anxious around family, friends, and my boyfriend and I just don’t understand. Whenever I’m in a group of even two my heart beats out of my chest, I slur my words, my thoughts are disorganized and I can’t form a sentence. Idk why this is happening around the people I’ve always been comfortable with. I don’t know what to say, what to talk about, it’s blank. My mind goes blank. I try to put myself in scenarios that I find uncomfortable such as going to the skatepark and trying to talk to people. But I clam up and end up keeping to myself in the back of the park because I can’t think of anything to say. I used to think of myself as smart and funny but it’s like that part of my brain has just disappeared and now I feel like my jokes fall flat. That used to be one of the only ways I could feel more comfort, just make someone laugh and then my anxiety would decrease. Now if I say something and that doesn’t happen my head feels like it’s being swallowed into a black hole. I can’t think of anything, I can’t talk to anyone, and then physically I start shaking and messing up whatever I’m doing only leading to more anxiety. I’ve always been more introverted, usually just listening, but I feel like I can’t absorb anything anymore. It’s like information goes in one ear and out the other and I feel stupid. Sometimes I think I pay so much attention to absorbing information that I can’t take anything in because I’m so distracted by my thought of having to learn it. I’ve gotten good grades through school, I can study well, but it’s like I lack common sense. It’s like I’m angry at myself for not having a higher EQ. I get mad at my younger self for not being more self aware, for not paying attention, and for not developing better social skills. I know that doesn’t get me anywhere but I don’t know how to stop. This feeling of being stupid is just in the back of my head playing over and over throughout the day. I’m sick of it, I don’t want to feel this way anymore but I don’t know how to break the cycle. I try to accept that these are anxious thoughts, telling myself they’re intrusive and not me, but it’s not working anymore. They’re so present that I can’t help but think this is just me. In high school I felt like I had so much confidence and didn’t think too much about what other people thought of me. That changed after college partially because of an emotionally manipulative ex and also stopping my sports career after my whole life of playing. I feel like I’ve lost my identity and have no clue how to find it again. I’ve recently started skateboarding, I picked up playing bass, and I try to draw something everyday but even having other outlets it’s like I’m so overwhelmed by everything I’m so behind on learning that I shy away from it. I don’t want to be like that, am I just being lazy? Sorry for the lengthy text, it’s a little disorganized but just some late night thoughts. Does anyone know why is this happening? Does anyone know how to build back self confidence and regain a sense of self? I feel drained by this and I’m tired of being angry at myself. I want to take steps to fix this but I don’t know how. "

cvmb53," Cured my social anxiety. Hi all, So here's my story. I'm a 24 year old male. I developed social anxiety after smoking marijuana and taking LSD at a music festival back in 2015. Before that, I never experienced any sort of social anxiety at all. Afterwards, I honestly found it difficult to socialize with people I had known for years and had no issues with, including my girlfriend at the time. Things got worse and worse. I stopped seeing people, I tried meditation and avoided all social interactions. Sometimes I couldn't even eat with my family. Only a couple of years ago I went on a skiing trip with my family and I was thinking about how anxious I was about social interaction for 3 hours on my way to the mountains, it was totally out of control. I'm sure many of you know the feeling, it is just so dreadful. Then things hit a critical point. I was in touch with mental health services already, but I had an argument with my family that led an ambulance to be called, and I was taken to a local hospital and saw a consultant psychiatrist and a doctor who was training to be a psychiatrist. They diagnosed me with psychosis. Being in hospital was terrible. I was there for a total of 3 months over 3 different stays, as it took me ages to really accept the diagnosis from the doctors. So how does this relate to social anxiety? Well, essentially the psychotic thinking created a lot of paranoia in my social interactions, things like ""this person doesn't like me"", or ""this person knows my private thoughts"" or ""my friends can tell that I'm anxious and they are judging me"" etc. Thoughts which I am sure are familiar to many of you. For me the biggest issue was that I was anxious and I felt like people *knew* that I was anxious, and that they were judging me for it, or felt anxious themselves. The problem was that they knew *too much* or saw *too much into* my thinking. This leads me to the conclusion that really, even though my symptoms were *manifesting* as social anxiety, really my social anxiety was just a symptom of a wider mental health issue of psychosis and *paranoia*. It took about 3 years for me to get the psychosis diagnosis. Even though it was a mild set of symptoms, and even though I had symptoms which people would dismiss as normal, I reached a point of crisis which revealed to the psychiatrist that I was experiencing psychosis. I have another friend who has struggled with social anxiety who thinks that the same thing happened to him, that actually the social anxiety was just a symptom of drug induced psychosis instead. I am now medicated (Seroquel) and my social anxiety has *completely gone*. My life has *completely* changed. I see people all the time. I go to Uni and study or hang out with people as much as I want to. I have made a bunch of new friends and reconnected with old friends. I go out most weekends. Sometimes with my friends and sometimes alone. Out to bars and meet new people, talk to girls, talk to guys, and generally have a great time. I'm not saying you have psychosis. This is just my story. If you have social anxiety, you should go and see a doctor. If you have smoked, snorted, or ingested something which made you feel anxious, paranoid or otherwise unsettled, you should go and see a doctor. I am lucky in that the psychosis version of social anxiety is really easy to fix, all I needed was medication. There is someone somewhere here lurking on this subreddit with the same situation, I hope that I can help that person and I wish all of you luck in defeating that shit, because it is bloody horrible.

hbe2jdq," I just realized I think I always try to look at something at least a little beautiful around me. Like a a river, a nearby park, etc. Switch this with looking at my shoes, people that are passing by, my phone.

7wcsop," How do I make friends 19[M] when I have severe trust issues. I'm a college freshman and I've noticed that I have trouble connecting with people. I originally thought that this was just because of the group that I was around during high school, but it turns out, the numerous back stabbings and bullying experience have made me completely distrustful of people and thus I always carry myself with a hard exterior shell. I feel so lonely in what should be the greatest time in my life. I'm not socially awkward, quite charming, actually, but thats just a mask I put on for people to see. In reality, im a miserable fuck and I've cried many times alone in my room when my roommate goes out with his girlfriend. I don't let anyone know that because then people will think I'm pathetic. College is stressful and I have even less time to go out and pretend to socialize with people. When I socialize with people, it's mostly me cracking jokes and bantering, I think most people think I'm chill, since I was just elected as one of my dorms representatives, but I don't actually know anyone on a deep level, much less a girlfriend I've been told by numerous girls in high school that I'm handsome, but I've never had a girlfriend in my life. I've never even held a girls hand before. How do I break free from my misery ? I just don't understand how people can just bond over mutual interests. I'm fairly good at several sports and table top games like table tennis, 8 ball pool, etc, and I try to not win and let other people win so they like me. In the end, I still can't feel close to them. Thanks for reading. Venting was cathartic. "
kz0z2s,"I want to take a break/leave my life for about 6 months at least.  nnI want to take a break/leave my life for about 6 months at least, I'm currently in college but im more and more realizing that this isn't for me, since I already changed my major once. I recently turned 23 and am nowhere near to finishing college and rather close to having a burn out. I dont feel right, stopped talking to my family for over a year even tho im still living at home. Can't get out of my bed for weeks (more like months) and am just unhappy in general, can't find any joy in anything. So the idea of leaving my current life in western europe for a couple of months and moving to a little apartment in the Mediterranean my family owns came to my mind. nnThe biggest problem that occurs to me is: I need to start making money online without any real skills, 400-600 $/â€šÃ‡Â¨ would be enough.

a0iyy2,"Am I under the WORST (best?) job conditions for a socially anxious introvert?. Hello everyone, I think I’m in the worst position to be as a socially anxious introvert: I just got a new job where I’m the only IT technician in an office space with around 50 people. I’m on the front lines for every tech-related problem. All of my higher ups live in Europe so all of my training is done through video calls, instant messages, and pre-written SOP articles. It also doesn’t help that none of them speak English as a first language, so there’s lot of uncertainty every time I’m left to do something on my own. I get terrified every time someone says “Hey you’re the new IT guy right?” Because I feel like they’re going to ask me to troubleshoot or fix something I don’t know anything about, then they’ll think “What’s the point of having an IT guy who can’t fix my issue?” I also realize however, that this job could be the BEST thing for me socially as it really throws me into an ocean full of sharks. Time to either sink or swim! Does anyone else already work jobs where their social anxiety is constantly challenged? How do you cope? How long did it take you to settle in?"

e82czwz,"18/M. This was me during an internship that lasted a year. Heavy anxiety. Depression. Suicidal thoughts. Panic attacks. In the beginning I thought ""Whatever, this is probably normal. It'll get better with time"" but that's just not the truth (at least for me). My boss was actually pretty cool, we could chat about our favorite movies and tv shows and he wouldn't get angry at me if I did a mistake. I felt like he really knew what was going on with me so he was very nice to me even under stress. But oh well, unfortunately he was mostly working in his own room which means that I couldn't get to work with/for him often. So my stupid bitch of a coworker took the leader role and fucking treated me and the other intern like shit. She couldn't comprehend what me and the other intern (she was also really anxious) were going through. It made me fucking scared to go to work cuz I always had that gut feeling that this is gonna be another day where I prove myself a failure. It was hell. Every morning I woke up thinking about what I'm gonna do wrong today. I always tried to suppress my anxiety by being ""fake happy"". This was especially problematic in front of customers. One time my coworker embarrassed me in front of a friendly customer - she told me to help him with something even though I didn't know how. So I was just standing there, mumbling a few words out of my mouth and stuttering like ""How can I help you?"" or ""uhmm let me see"" while trying to find a solution to his problem that I just didn't have. A minute goes by and she yells at me, telling me to go away. I remember hearing this old man say ""Hey please don't yell at him"". That was one moment where I just wanted to cry but tried to supress it. Went to the toilet and had an anxiety attack. This happened a lot. When the other intern cried a few times my coworker told her to just go to the toilet and cry there. This furthermore showed me that I shouldn't cry during work. So I cried after my shift was over. Eventually one day I almost tried to kill myself after a very rough day. I went to the lake at night, stared at the water and had a panic attack. I told myself ""Come on, it's only a few weeks until it's over. You can do it! You've a come a long a way, you can't give up *now*!"" Fortunately that was 2 years ago and I think my SA has gotten better, mostly because I'm not dealing with that pressure that I had on me during this internship anymore. I still get flashbacks from that time occasionally. Sometimes I hear the voice of that angry coworker telling me I'm a failure. But Right now I'm studying computer science and I think it made me less anxious cuz every student is just kinda living for themselves and that's how I like it. Although the thought of going through this someday one more time makes me scared. I guess one thing that I've learned is that you shouldn't blame yourself for everything you do wrong. I used to do this. I was always like ""She is right! You're just a failure and a crybaby!"" but after that internship ended I realized that this is not how somebody should be treated at work, especially not an insecure, anxious 16 y/o intern. So please OP, remember not to blame it on yourself. There are real assholes living in this world who will blame you for their behaviour. DON'T GIVE UP CHAMP. YOU CAN DO IT. Edit: Holy shit I didn't realize I wrote an essay here. Sorry haha I hope it's not too long. It's just that all these horrible memories came back and I felt like sharing them this time. Hope it doesn't bother you"
dlkuf9t," Yeah, i know that feeling. When I stay inside for almost a week, it feels like I am entering an alien world. The scary thing for me is that the more I isolate myself the happier i become.. the happiest period in my life so far were a few months where i only did groceries weekly, and just enjoyed music and videogames. I am happy with this as is. My anxiety may or may not lighten one day, and I think i would gladly spend more time outdoors. It is very easy for other people because they have almost exclusively positive social memories and don't feel any significant amount of stress. "
f3o4ah2,"Yes me basically. Makes sense why there is a lot of anxiety nowdays.nn Quick edit: I forgot to mention I love my parents though, they never abused me, they fed me and provided me with things when I needed them. I returned their concern and I never asked for much or went out to not concern them.nHonestly it is what it is, the grass is always greener on the other side. I am glad I had the parents I had, this is just a hurdle like any other."
i8nlw8,"Being an immigrant has made my social anxiety so much worse.. Hi everyone! So it's been a year since I (23F) moved to another country, I should note that the local language isn't my native language but I speak it pretty fluently as a second language (this is important to my post, you'll see why), and overall it's been great. Pretty crazy that I managed to move to another country alone considering my anxiety issues but it also makes sense in some ways. My home country is quite small and conservative and I had lived in the same city for over 20 years, almost my whole life, before I came here so I really enjoy the anonymity and freedom, also I'm queer and my new country is a lot safer for me in that sense. But the problem is that my social anxiety has gone THROUGH THE ROOF since I came here, like I was treated and medicated for anxiety in my teens so it's something I have a history of and thought I had at least somewhat under control, until maybe a few months after I came here. I guess I started experiencing culture shock and increasingly I became scared of situations that involved me having to talk to people, especially complete strangers but not exclusively, and much of this revolves around the fact that, while I speak the local language more than well enough to function in everyday situations, I have a pretty noticeably foreign accent. As in, people understand me most of the time, but they know basically straight away once I open my mouth that I'm not from here... and it sucks because this sort of judgment, while not (usually) ill-intentioned, bothers me and I'm not sure why. I think it's partly because I'm afraid of standing out in a negative way and being perceived as ""weird"" or ""different"" but, whatever the cause, it prevents me from living my life normally. I completely avoid going to shops that don't have self-service checkouts, when I go to bars I give my friends money to order drinks at the bar for me, I've put so many administrative tasks on hold if they don't have an online service that replaces going to their physical office and talking to someone, like I've wanted to join my city library for so long now but I've avoided doing it because there's no way to sign up online and you have to talk to someone in person, and perhaps worst of all I live with flatmates and avoid being in the common areas at the same time as them (including the kitchen, not ideal when you already suffer from an eating disorder). I work from home too, my job was in a small office but remote working came in back in March due to Covid-19 and we have stayed this way since, I'm going into the second year of my postgraduate degree in just over a month's time and that's also going to be mostly remote, all of which allows me to isolate myself even more than I would normally. Honestly the only times I'm truly comfortable are when I go outside in my city and walk through the crowds without talking to anyone, like in shopping centres or metro stations or markets where I can sort of just exist and blend into a crowd without being perceived by people. It's truly a sad way of living, I wish I was comfortable enough to be able to go into shops and cafés and talk to people and order things like a normal person but I just... can't get over my fear of being perceived and evaluated. It really sucks. Even in spite of everything I'd rather die living like this in this country than ever go back home but it would be nice if I could actually make the most of being here and the freedom I've gained. I don't know if anyone else here has a similar situation or has any advice for starting to overcome it, but honestly if you made it to the end of this long-ass post then thank you. &lt;3"
elr1e2z,"Its true that it never just... stops. I missed half my education because of social anxiety, I was scared I'd never finish my GCSEs (I'm British), let alone make it to uni. But I'm sitting here studying for my 3rd year finals right now, and I have a few friends in my flat, all of whom suffer from various mental health conditions. We help each other. I started meds about 6 months ago, and they help a lot, but its not a magic pill. I couldn't go outside a couple of weeks ago, thats the worst I've been in a while, but since I started meds I've gotten better and better at getting out of those slumps. I know its frustrating that it never ends, but someday you look back and realise by taking one step forward at a time and forgiving yourself for every stumble, you get way further than you ever thought possible."
hwgkq6,"I can’t even leave my house for more than 30 minutes and it’s been almost a year. Dude I won’t even go outside in case the neighbors might see me or ask me for something (they use to ask my dad for rides all the time) . I live at the end of a street so if I drive I have to pass the houses all the way down to the end of the street. It’s crazy because my dad got me a truck just so I can try and leave . I JUST CANT . If someone were to knock on the door I can’t answer it , if I get a phone call my heart drops and I can feel a panic attack .. over a phone call . And I never answer it . If someone is coming over I told my dad to let me know so I lock the door so I have enough time to run to my room and hide for hours and hours until they leave . I see a psychiatrist and he put me on meds Wellbutrin +latuda+klonopin . They are definitely working . BUT I WILL NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE . I have a truck to leave at anytime . I’m 21 years old , no job , ZERO friends. I’m not joking I literally have no friends . This is so weird but I will look out the window and pace back and forth to make sure no one is outside .. if I hear any sudden noise I jump/ jolt ? I can’t believe almost a year ago I actually got a job even tho it lasted 2 weeks , I can’t even imagine trying to do that right now . I feel like I’m in a dream , nothing looks real to me , blank mind , time is passing by so fast , I can’t get this time back but fuck , if I continue this way I think about being homeless . I just needed to post this , I haven’t talked to people in so long. Posting this is going to give me a lot of anxiety but I just needed to vent . You guys have a good day"
swhwlu, Feeling less anxious in public at night?!?. Anyone else feel more comfortable being outside at night opposed to during the day? I love going for walks. I don't know why maybe because there is less people and traffic out. Almost as if the darkness is a protective blanket for me. 
hjs7cre," This is why I like it when the days get shorter and it gets darker earlier, much prefer being outside when its dark "
535qm0," So yeah.... Okay so I just want to put a quick summary of my life here because it's one of those nights where I avoid the outdoors and stay in my room hating myself. I'm 19 years old and have been diagnosed with social anxiety and depression disorder. I'm on medication and go to therapy but it doesn't really help. I dropped out of high school my senior year because I couldn't take it anymore. Everyday it would get to the point of me getting so sick and having panic attacks due to the constant need to communicate and be social. I have yet to get my ged because I'm terrified to go take the test. I have dreams and aspirations to go to college but in reality that'll never happen because I can't be in a school setting without freaking out. I had a few friends but basically I pushed them away accidentally by consistently turning down parties and going out with them and just avoiding social situations with them altogether. I have one friend at this point but he lives in another state so it's not like we get to hangout or anything. I have a girlfriend that I love to death but she lives a 1000 miles away. I love her so much and would be lost if I didn't have her but I can just sense that it won't last because I can't even get the courage to facetime her so it seems as if I don't care :(. I don't have a job because everytime I get an interview I just sit in the parking lot scared to get out of the car and eventually talk myself out of it and go home. My family doesn't understand so they are constantly on me to get my life together and shit. I just feel like life is set up for me to fail. I can't progress. I can't get what I want. And it all resorts back to this lovely thing called social anxiety. I just hate myself so much. Anyways that's about it, maybe someone can relate and offer advice idk. "

4ojl3a," Why do I sperg out around girls? Why do I always pause before tackling someone in sport?. I swear I could just be having a good conversation with my mates at school and then all of a sudden bam a girl joins in. I literally can't talk at all. I've had conversations with a few girls before, but they seem awfully one-sided (That being, I ask them a question, they answer, repeat.) Anything that can help me with this? I literally feel like Raj from The Big Bang Theory. Also one more thing that I've noticed is that when I was playing rugby the other day at school, and whenever I tried to tackle the ball carrier, I'd run super-fast towards them (like 110% effort), but at the last second I stop, in fear of bumping into them (even though that's what should happen in rugby tackles) or bowling them over. Also, I don't seem to understand how to make physical contact with another guy in terms of jokes without looking gay (e.g. holding someone on the shoulder, or picking them up / dacking or slapping someone on the ass) I'm not that autistic that I don't find these things funny; It's just I feel nervous that the person will turn around and call me gay. Same goes with punching/pushing someone or jelly-legging them. My best friends do this all the time to me, but I feel like if I do it, I'll hurt them. Another thing that pisses me off is in basketball I hesitate to grab the ball from other people because I don't want to invade their personal space, but in floor-ball (hockey with no ice), I have no problem almost bashing someone's stick out of their hand. I just don't even know. "
8ekrfa," [Need Advice] “Friends” going down the shore after a senior dance, I want to see if I can come with.. I’m friendly with pretty much all the people going together but I’ve never really been with any of them outside of school and on Xbox. The other day I overheard two of them talking about getting a house down the shore while I was putting on my headset and they said they needed one more person. When talking of names neither mentioned me. Should I ask if I could go with or no? "
g4un9n0," I was selectively mute, and very hard of hearing when I was younger. The only friends I had were the people that adults forced onto me. Though the friends I did have were very supportive. Through the help of counsellors, I came out of my ‘shell’, and I can now talk to people, have conversations, be sociable etc, it just gives me a lot of social anxiety. When I was 10, the ‘popular kids’ in my class started being extraordinarily mean. One of them would give me Chinese Burns under the table every day, until I stabbed him with my pencil. They’d completely ignore me, then tell me I should be used to it by now. They’d call me a monster and make games about how terrible I was. Then they’d spread lies about me, saying I was a hypocrite, and turned basically the whole class against me. I worked out that over the course of only 2 days, 2/3’s of the class had said something derogatory to me related to one particular lie, and of the remaining 10 people who hadn’t, only 2 actually supported me. Towards the end, they started to corner me behind the edge of the building, break my hearing aid, throw me against the wall. It was honestly the worst time of my life. I couldn’t tell anyone either, because I knew that teachers were useless, and my parents believed in standing up for yourself. Which I did, but what are you supposed to do when it’s 10 on 1? Nobody helped me. I got really depressed. It was never diagnosed because I never really told anyone. I just acted happy when my parents were around. But I remember getting home, and sitting in the corner of the bathroom, holding the radio right next to my ears and tuning it to between stations so it just played white noise really loudly, and then just rocking back and forth while moaning for about an hour. That was the o my way I could calm myself down. It’s been 4 years since it began. I’m in secondary school now, and I managed to get into a school that they didn’t, so I don’t see them anymore. Well. To be honest, one of them goes to school with one of my oldest friends who I go swimming with. My old bully began feeding my friend lies and basically ruining my time at club too. But I clarified what actually happened, what that person is actually like, and it’s all good now. Even after all this time, I still don’t talk about it. Nobody knows except my sister, my best friend and the kid from swimming. It’s left a massive impact on me, as I’m constantly worried about the same thing happening again. My social anxiety came back in full swing after it, but it’s better now. I’ve learnt some tips, like, be confident. To be honest, I was bullied so much, I honestly don’t care anymore. Also, some of the popular kids at my new school tried something on me, as I was obviously the quiet nerd. I just went completely postal on them the first time, and now nobody tries to bully me. I’ve also made it my mission to help those who are being bullied themselves. I know how horrible it is, and I never want anybody to go through any of the pain I went got. I’m so sorry that you had to go through this too. I wish you, and everyone else all the best. Have a great day. :) "
phplrj," I need bigger goals than chasing peoples attention but I don't know what. my town is boring af. I live in a small gossiping town in kurdistan/ iraq people are desperate and they flee the country by sea on small boats to reach Europe. there is nothing interesting or new to do. im a boring ""NICE GUY"" with not a lot of hobbies, i have a boring personality. to not be a ""NICE GUY"" I would be an asshole. its clear no one likes me and the problem is me. I have to make my self happy. no one is my slave and I have to fix my self on my own. I have trouble with comparing my self to YouTubers and Successful twitch streamers. I even tried to start a YouTube channel. or start a twitch channel but all I have is a phone. but Im greatful for what I have sometimes.. I know money isn't happiness but is part of it. everyones goal is happiness. everyone wants to be happy, everyone wants to matter, most everyone wants to change the world. me included. its always me chasing others but im tired of this, since i get nothing out of it and no one cares for me or likes me or loves me. I want to love my self. and I have improved a lot. I'm 20, I'm at last year of school, I'm trying to learn a new language and learning mechanic skills with my dad.

I would fap everyday. all i could think of were girls online. bc datings not allowed in my town. porn crushes my soul. 20 days of no fapping was hard.

rylct5," overcoming Social Anxiety. (warning- this is not advice, and I'm only peaking on my experience) Also, this is going to be a stream of consciousness type of thing When I was younger, maybe starting high school age, I've always believed that I had to overcome my social anxiety to achieve my goals. So that's what I tried to do. Every day for years, I would struggle to mask my social anxiety. I couldn't shake, I had to remain in eye contact, I couldn't avoid people. And it never worked. Having social anxiety and being self-conscious of having social anxiety only made it worse. My inner voice had become so negative towards myself. Whereas your inner voice should be a soothing oneness with your being, my inner voice had become my enemy. I was overly critical of everything I did and thought. And then the pandemic happened, and I got to spend time alone. I think that's the best thing that ever happened to me. I had so much self-discovery, and I was allowed the graciousness of being able to choose when and how I wanted to interact with others. I also had time to reflect on my life and my goals and what I wanted to do, and I went for it. All the while still having social anxiety and terrified of other people. I did things that I never thought I would be able to do. I volunteered on my own, got multiple jobs by myself. (And I'm going to add this in because I'm proud of it), I even got an on-the-spot hire because my interview was that good. I also started going outside, wearing the clothes that I wanted ( I dress alt), learning how to drive, getting my license, shopping in stores, and my proudest achievement started going to the gym. Everything that I always wanted to do but always thought I couldn't do because I had social anxiety. I never defeated social anxiety. I'm definitely going to need therapy if I ever want to do that. But I think the best thing that ever happened to me was deciding, "" yeah, I have social anxiety, but this is what I want to do, so I'm going to do it even if I'm not perfect at it."" Worrying about having social anxiety did nothing but hold me back------now, I'm not saying don't worry about having social anxiety. The point in trying to make here is to give yourself graciousness and love. Even if you feel completely alone, let your inner voice give you the acceptance that we need as human beings. Yes, I'm still socially anxious and overly conscious of myself, but my inner voice is so much more kind towards me. \--- I haven't read this subreddit for a long time, but only after reading it have, I realized how far I've come from where I used to be. I never overcame social anxiety. Social anxiety was never the thing holding me back. Extra - some of my current beliefs on SA that are liable to change 1. There is no need to try to mask the symptoms of having SA. I think acceptance can bring down the overall shame and frustration that is felt when you believe that you unsuccessfully hid your SA. It's comparable to trying to treat a crack addiction by making yourself stop shaking. At the end of the day, you're still addicted to drugs, and trying to force yourself to stop shaking probably will just tire you out instead of helping you 2. Reading this book was amazing, "" The Drama of the Gifted Child."" It's not specifically about social anxiety, but I made a lot of connections while reading it with my social anxiety. It made me tear up in the gym y'all lmao. Just read more. In general, it's fun 3. treat everything as a learning experience. for example, Yeah this is an important date, but if it goes wrong, I can just learn from what happened this time and try to make the next one better 4. You're doing great, and you're trying your best. You can do it. Love you. "
j4ossr,"How do I find a girlfriend at university. I never really had any relationship my entire life. I'm at university I'm 19 almost 20 and the way I see it, I will never get a gf with the way I'm going and I'm scared for it. I'm sitting in my dorm room all alone no one to talk to, not even flat mates, I just want someone who truly cares about me 1 on 1. It's been like this for for almost 2 weeks and I'm going insane stuck in my room. Like I'm just left to rot in here I feel so lonely and worthless. Some days I don't even eat at all or I don't even get out of bed, other days I walk for miles with no destination just walking for ages for some reason. Sometimes I go to a park I like. I wish I could take a girl to some of the places I have seen cuz I've seen some truly spectacular sights I doubt any other students have come across. And then there r days where I eat constantly and I can't stop cuz I get too bored. It's so simple, I just need to go up to a girl that catches my eye and start a conversation. But I'm scared to do it. so incredibly scared. I'm not really scared of rejection, I'm more scared of her reaction towards me coming up to her, things she does that may suggest my appearance is ugly, or the way I react will suggest I'm just a very socailly boring and bland guy. And if I feel like tahts what she is trying to tell me in a kind way that will destroy me inside forever. This is such a shit mindset but I can't get past it. I have been asking this question for years now mutliple times and never find actual advice about what I can do to find the confidence to truly express my self towards a random stranger. Thats all I want to learn how to do. I have hobbies and interesting views on life but who do I share them with? And I'm more interested to hear about her life instead I love all humans we r all the same I know this why can't I go up to one without stuttering or running away! and then it's back to depression and loneliness."
ftgiqn6," I've become extremely self aware when going outside since lockdown is over, I'm working on it but it sucks "
4rcycv," Do you think it's good to actively change your interests and hobbies?. All my life i've been alone and without real, good friends. As a kid I did the weirdest shit alone at home, until i was 12 or so i played with not only toys but also household items when there were no toys left and all happened in my fantasy worlds. I didnt listen to pop or any kind of music, just maybe the music from my videogames and sunk into them, along with movies and series and often talked to myself pretending to be in some kind of TV show or something - Just thinking about it creeps me out now, and i have basically pushed all these memories to the back of my mind when i grew up. I only sometimes remember them and it shocks me every time. Until puberty hit (and it hit late - maybe at 14 or 15) i was basically the weirdest, loneliest weirdo you could imagine. It often fills me with hate to think about me as a kid. I want to punch that kid in the face and tell him that other kids don't suck and he should go play some soccer or games with them. So i wasn't normal. The reason? I don't know. Maybe i had social anxiety from the moment i was born. It was different back then, and i didn't get that depressed. I think kids just do this - sink into fantasy worlds and lifes to protect themselves from dying inside. But now I'm 18 years old and have depression. I'm not a kid anymore and i just want to do stuff with people. I basically have no hobbies or real interests. Most of my ""interests"" just stem from the fact that i hang online all day and stuff. I don't feel like those are serious interests. I want to go out and do sports or something. A _real_ hobby. Not a lonely loser hobby. I know there's people who want to spend their days programming or something, and that's completely okay - But i never felt like that kind of person. I can enjoy doing things like these, but i feel like it's just avoidance and fleeing from my non-existing social life. I don't _know_ what other stuff i could enjoy, because i don't go out or have people to show me new stuffs. I played the violin as a kid and I'm not sure why exactly i stopped - i definitely always felt it was weird to play the violin as a boy, so i tried to keep it a secret at school and stuff. Of course i don't feel that way anymore and shouldn't give a fuck - But now i don't know if i just manipulated myself into thinking that i didn't enjoy the hobby anymore because i didn't want to have a weird hobby or if i actually stopped enjoying it. I'm such an insecure person that it drives me crazy sometimes to look for an identity and my friend once said to me he doesn't find a way to describe me because i don't have an ego or something that defines me, other than insecurity itself. And it freaks me out to think about how i might have manipulated myself so much to change that that's maybe the reason for my depression. But i kinda want to pick up NEW hobbies because i want to start a new life and let go of all the stress from my past and childhood. I wasn't unhappy all the time as a kid but still - i always wanted to be someone else and i didn't grow up in a healthy way most definitely. It probably all traumatized me. An introvert kid would have been fine but i am _not_ introverted. My family situation was, and still is complicated and i hate my dad and my oldest brother always was a weirdo while the other one is an introvert - But i wasn't happy. Neither a weirdo who doesn't realize that he is one and is okay with who he is, nor an introvert who doesn't need more than one good friend and wants to be alone most of the time. No, i was never okay with myself and i always struggled with having no social life, even as that weird kid that talked to himself pretending to be in movies and who was obsessed with Pokémon. So the question remains in my head - Did i change because i was trying to become happy and to find myself or just because i wanted to fit expectations?! Maybe both? And is that a bad thing? It's not like ""introvert-interests"" that you do alone at home are gonna help you with your social life. I think i did all kind of stuff to distract myself from loneliness. And i was a bit weirdo kid to begin with, i was really annoying to talk to and probably had some kind of hyperactivity disorder - The original reason for not having friends. Not sure when anxiety kicked in as well. But now i feel like i grew up to be pretty normal inside - just with social anxiety and depression to keep me from living a good life. What do you guys think? Is it okay to let go of things you loved doing in the past when they keep you from having a social life? How do i know wether my interests are just ""distraction"" or actual hobbies for a lifetime? Note: I dreamt big as a kid, wanted to be an actor or something, wanted to do some kind of sport maybe - all kinds of ""social"" hobbies. But i never did pick those up, because i was shy, afraid, lonely... all kinds of things. Just the violin thing that i wanted to do from age 6. But like i said i kinda lost interest in that probably. Piano is now an interest, but i never had lessons. I feel lost, like shit, lonely, like a boring person who has nothing to say and my weirdo childhood still haunts me and destroys my confidence. "
oi9iny, I just wanna go outside without the feeling of being judged. Thats all I ask Lol. 
dt18716," Just do it. Sports don’t require a lot of social skills, plus you will meet people who share your interest (soccer). When I was very young, my parents put me on sports teams so that I would be forced to be around a other kids. My mom new I was very shy and a doctor told my mom they she thought I might have a very mild form of Aspergers (which I probably do). As a result I starting playing basketball/flag football/ baseball throughout my childhood. In junior high I was the best player on my schools basketball team, and I played basketball for my high school in 9th and 10th grade. I never really made any friends in basketball, and would often get picked on for being awkward, but I was always pretty comfortable playing sports with other people (because I grew up doing it). My senior year I tried out for the soccer team (I had been practicing by myself for about a year and 2 of my friends were on the team). I tried really hard and did my best, but I didn’t make the team. I had fun though. I made some embarrassing mistakes, but I never dwelled on it. Just go have fun. Honestly, if you playing soccer and you are dieing and gasping for breath, you aren’t going to be thinking about social anxiety 😂 "

Ive been hanging out with this guy, im not sure why i do it. i mean i like him so if he asks i don't want to leave him alone but we have nothing in common. Anyway every minute of his day outside of work is spent getting baked and he nearly always brings along his other stoner friends. For a while it was kind of funny just listening to how dopey they are but its just pretty f*cking boring now. when i want to hang out i want to do something like some kind of activity besides just sitting around getting baked. Ive said this to him a few times but he has no interest in doing things we just end up going walking on the beach or something until he gets paro and inists we go somewhere less public. Anyone hanging out with stoners know a way to make it more fun ? Or make these people more alive energetic ? Do i just give on on them ? Any ideas ? "
e9xd0uy," I love memes, but this sub is not the place for it. I don't remember subscribing to a hot instagram meme page. Just go to the most popular posts of this sub and you'll see that 99% of them are memes or text posts and some of them don't even have any core relation to social anxiety. Meanwhile, what does our [socially anxious friend with suicidal thoughts get?](Oh, 24 likes and 17 comments. Right. And you mean to tell me there's nothing wrong with this sub? Pathetic. I thought this place was meant to help people and discuss issues in our lives. If you just want to see the poor quality memes and text posts about your ""awkward"" social life why not surf tumblr instead of r/socialanxiety? Frankly, I don't have any idea why I'm still subscribed to this. I guess my naive mindset led me to believe that maybe this sub could eventually be actually helpful. "
fusqwja, Definitely start by getting out the house. Go on solo hikes and things like that itll give you more to talk about while you're still coming into the world. Once you have friends and have things to talk about other than yourself it becomes easier it's just really fucking hard to put yourself out there initially. Look for the light at the end of the tunnel and run at it.
