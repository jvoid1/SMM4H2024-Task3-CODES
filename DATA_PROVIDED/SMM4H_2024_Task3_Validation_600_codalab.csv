fc6l72u,cruise,"(1) I had SA but managed to practically eradicate using cognitive behavioural technies. I vigorously exposed myself to social situations - dates, public speaking engagements, parties, job interviews, doing foolish things in public, approaching people for dates -- more than 1000 times. Daily I worked on challenging the irrational beliefs that lie behind social anxiety. I completely reject the idea that you cannot pratically eliminate social anxiety - because it's merely a manufactured fear in your mind. In reality, if your'e thinking straight, there is no reason why you should be anxious about disapproval or rejection. Two years ago I couldn't walk into an elevator without my heart pounding as if a car was about to hit me. Yesterday I went on a party cruise alone and made friends. I therefore know a considerable amount about social anxiety - not everything - but a shit ton. &amp;#x200B; (2) You're 43 years old and you're calling people ""fat fucks"" and ""weirdoes"" ?",0
8eijpy,"runners, run , run "," Anyone looking for a friend? Real friend, behind a computer or not.. I've tried all subreddits, never really thought about trying the actual social anxiety thread. I'm just sick, tired, and depressed with having no friends, like the most of us. I want someone I can look forward to talking to after work, someone I can talk to when I'm bored. I shouldn't have to say it on this sub, but I'm not looking for hit-and-runners, I'm sick of them. My introduction: 21/m from Western Canada, recently moved from Eastern Canada. Really found out I had/developed social anxiety around the age of 17, been on multiple medication and I'm just getting sick and tried of trying them because they're all placebos to be and they ain't even working for depression, almost like I'm immune. I had a real rough childhood, mostly the cause for my anxiety/social anxiety &amp; depression. I enjoy self learning myself shit, I found out recently I really like web development and I knew for a while now I enjoy graphic design and consider myself pretty good at it in certain areas. I guess after all these years of steady learning myself things after school did good because I recently got a comment from my boss that I was a **really** fast learner and 100% the fastest learner he's ever had, that boosted my self-esteem a great deal. I enjoy video games, only on PC though. I run a game server and I really love doing so. Always tried to run one when I could. My timezone is GMT (UTC-07:00), but I work 3pm-11pm and because the pills I'm on, I can't get out of bed until like 2pm because it's just impossible for me to wake up and actually get up. I'm usually looking to chat with someone after work and maybe before, so that'll give you the general time-zone I'm living in. I don't care if you're male, female, dog, or cat. I don't care if you're 14, 21, 37, or 60. If you want to try and make friends with me, hit me up. ",0
didnpbe,"running , golf"," Breathe, darling. The purpose of dating is to see if that particular person is likable and compatible with you to make a relationship with. If you know he's the outgoing, partying type of animal, then perhaps he's not the kind you need in your life and the same applies the other way 'round. So far he should already be aware that you're a bit shy around crowds. If not, you should inform him properly, maybe masking it halfway into being a reminder and a joke. ""Just remember that I'm uneasy with crowds/people/strangers/etc. and if I lose it, you'll have a chance at being my knight in the shining armor tonight!"" If you want a long-running relationship, it will come up at some point anyway. As for your incoming date, just try and have fun with whatever activities have been planned (movies? food? mini golf?).

dxe6gbb, sea," I've been overweight since 2nd grade and it affected my self esteem as a teenager. I kept saying ""yeah I don't really care"" and whatever, while habitually holding my schoolbag/jacket/arms in my lap when sitting so it would hide my muffin top belly. I went on a brief diet with my mother during jr. high and I shook off about 7kg, which eventually creeped back because the diet was making me absolutely miserable (and the school dance was over, I was no longer on display, so no need for that dieting shit). The weight loss, however, didn't actually make me feel any better about myself in at any point. I kind of accidentally psyched myself out of thinking I was sea-bottom scum. I got drunk at a theme club, went to take a bathroom break and walked by this massive, floor-to-ceiling mirror. I thought to myself: ""Wow, I am the cuterest cow!"" and yes, that is the exact phrasing. I was drunk, so sue me, grammar police. What I'm saying is that yes, if you feel you need to do something about your weight, do it. It's not healthy on the long run. It may or may not help with your issues. What you need to do is understand in your heart that hey, I'm not so bad afterall! I'm positive you have many good qualities that all sum up into a swell person both inside and out. Fix what you can, accept what you can't and don't fixate on the negative. ",0

Anyone with the slightest knowledge of CBT knows how dangerous it is to expose someone with social phobia to a situation that causes him extreme anxiety, it becomes a traumatic experience. nnThe reality of our landscape does not change, our future is not very bright, if I am being sincere. However, its the small steps of getting out of our comfort zone delicately that may make us comfortable with routinely activities (not talking to random strangers). This moron confuses SA with horny teenagers who lack social skills.nnAs for the ""nofap"" or ""yesfap"" tendencies, it is absolute bullshit to consider them solutions to SA.

edff9bw,stream," You put the idea behind my post into words better than I could, thank you for your reply. Yes, it seems we feel certain things in the same way. I have also created analogies, albeit a bit different than yours. I used to imagine my mind (the good side) fighting an antagonist - shadowy figure - in a slow fight to death. At times it seemed one or the other side was close to winning, but neither ever did. Over time I have realized that this shadowy element is not strictly comprised of external circumstances, but that it's at least partially my own creation. Now I see it as a 'bad' side of my mind which works against the better one and leverages outside factors as good as it can in order to persist. This bad side tells me to abandon all hope and stick to what I know, let the anxiety reign. Sometimes it even throws me candy when I avoid a socially challenging situation. Now you have got me thinking whether these two fellas are in fact distinct entities or not. It could be one nice mushy blend for what I know. Sometimes I tend to loathe the bad side, but doesn't that mean I also hate myself since it's a part of me I'm after? Would there be a hole left if I were to carve the bad side out? It's devilish. Sorry if I'm sounding too crazy, I was just having a stream of thoughts after reading your post. I'll probably go back and read it again after a bit. Peace to you to man! ",0
cxv7qam,Nature ,"I'm also a 23 yr old male, but from England.nWhen I first started working at the job I work at still, my team leader had a serious conversation with me about whether I'm happy here or not.

They ALWAYS mention how quite I am. They never fail not to.nnThat was around 3 months into the job (job is IT support technician at a high school). n4 years later I am very comfortable in my workplace. I feel like this is because my colleagues (3 of them) are very friendly and were all friends as well as work colleagues. They involve me in conversations and we have banter on whatsapp when we're not at work. We're very close nit and it's helped me tremendously. nI think a lot of it depends on who you're working with. I have no idea what will happen when I moved to another job. nnI feel like the job I do has helped a lot with my anxiety. Because I've been ""forced"" (by the nature of my job) to go to different people and fix their computers and what not and to answer phone calls etc. It's helped. Maybe a job similar to mine would be good for you? I can't say. It doesn't have to be IT support. I don't know how good you are with IT or what qualifications you have. BUT IT COULD BE ANYTHING.

e9cpk2, hill,"For everyone that is fighting with social Anxiety.. Hey, everyone, I love being in this group. Thanks for letting me in and getting to know everyone. I’m here for a little while now and I wanted to share my story with you, regarding my struggles with social anxiety. (and how things got a lot better) As far as I can look back, I always dreaded groups of people. I could talk with people one on one when I knew them and the topic was in my interest, but how bigger the group the more I disappeared in the background and starting to feel lonely. I had some things I was happy about but I had a problem, a HUGE problem and I didn’t know how to solve it. Even though It seemed like my life was doing well. I was terrible at Socializing with new people and started to go down the hill… I always thought things like: ‘’Is there something wrong with me’’ ‘’Why is everybody having a good time and I’m standing here alone?’’ ‘’I’m not interesting’’ ‘’I want to participate but I don’t know what to say…’’ So many people and still I felt alone. Like did it even matter why I was here in the first place? No one seems to care about my presence. And the cluttering noise of all those voices, what if they just don’t like me and are just ignoring me, secretly hoping that I would leave on my own? I could not understand why I was not able to make a conversation with anyone. I could try to talk to someone I didn’t know but, I was too scared to do that, my heart rate would go up, my head turned red, Knees shaking and my hands wear sweating. I’m not giving someone a hand with that warm sticky hands… That would be weird right? DAMN, How Could I ever gain the confidence to talk to someone… At work, it was no different, when I had a meeting with co-workers. My mind would race all the time but when I had to say something I would just stay quiet. I still remember the day that I got promoted around Christmas and my boss told me I should do a speech In front of everybody UNPREPARED. I didn’t want to do it but I couldn’t say No either. Most Awkard moment of my life… Almost panicking in front of my co-workers… Those were the struggles and thoughts I had almost every day. Of course, I tried to overcome my fear and starting to talk to someone. It felt so awkward... That conversation died really fast and made me feel like a total failure. My mind went blank and didn’t know what to say… I thought that I might be disturbing that person his privacy. Frustrated and confused I go home, I went on the internet to look for some guidance on how to talk to people/socializing. I got angry every time I saw those mainstream videos on youtube where the person in the video clearly hasn’t figured it out himself. ‘’Just be confident’’ or Just be yourself’’ they say. Like really F\*cking smart Einstein, Look where that ‘’Just be yourself’’ BS has brought me at this point. And even worse it looks like everyone else already has it figured out. No else seems to have this problem… I thought the only way to be cool and accepted by others, was to be someone else instead of embarrassing the person I really was. I already had tried some confidence/dating courses on the internet for a lot of money…A psychologist that gave me wrong diagnose, Therapists that didn’t understand me, Psychiatrists that gave meds like they where some candy, Stupid Apps that didn’t work and on social media I haven’t any success so far. All I wanted was that someone came along to help me out of that jungle of frustration and confusion and help me to become the coolest person in the room. I wanted to be funny and interesting at the same time. I wanted to be that person that people like to hang out with. I wanted to become more outgoing and easily make friends. I wanted to lose the fear of getting judged and self-doubt. I didn’t want to care anymore what people thought about me. Now after almost 5 years of hustling hard getting myself out of my comfort zone and working hard on myself. I overcame my social anxiety, Have no trouble talking in front of a large group of people, I can engage in conversations with more people included than just 1, I can speak in an assertive way without starting to freak out. I am making a career and had several girlfriends that were beautiful and interesting that I never thought would be in my league. All I did was improving step by step my social skills. Now what I want to do is help people in their 20’s and 30’s with social anxiety, that can resonate with my story. And If you read until here, the chances are really high that you have been going through the same. Tell me about your experiences! I’m really curious to hear about it! in the comments or just send me a Private Message!",0
3qm3au,run," Getting into a new social life (moving out, new studies) is always like a domino-effect crash for me.. Just imagine it's winter and super icy outside. You see 3 cars slide as the ice-coating on the asphalt is too slick for their wheels, then you look to the other side and see 5 more cars sliding down. Eventually all the cars crash into each other and get wrecked by the impact of collision, all because it was snowy and icy and they couldn't keep their grab on the road. That's how I often feel about me, my anxiety and moving into new social situations or meeting new people. It starts out well enough most of the time, but eventually, like the cars, time has passed and I've spent one day in my room alone that turns into 3 days until it's an entire week, and suddenly I feel like things start passing by me. Suddenly bumping into the same people I talked to the first few days feels weird and alienating. Suddenly I don't know what to say anymore. Have I run out of things to say, perhaps? No, it must be becuase *I've done absolutely nothing I can talk about* for the last week. Suddenly I start feeling like these people seem concerned when they see me as if they suspect me for something. When I walk away from them I can hear them chatting loudly and playfully with the next person that came across them, quite in contrast to how they reacted to my own appearance. It's always this way for me, and it has been for maybe 6 or more years in a row now, and I can not even taste what life felt like when life was better anymore. It's been too long, and the phantom pain has disappeared. Now I'm numb and I'm watching my own life fall to pieces like a domino-effect time after time, because I let it happen. My *new friends* are already way over there, past the point of feeling like strangers in a new city. Meanwhile, I left myself in a rut once again. I don't know why. ",0
5ee8xt,surf," I'm fine with living an asocial life... but I'm not fine with being depressed and guilty about it.. I feel I prefer a lot of times to be asocial. I like doing things that require less responsibility, like playing video games or surfing whatever I want and playing Guitar (no point in sugarcoating. I do enjoy it) but it's like I think I can have it both ways, but when push comes to shove I'm actually really sad and every once in a while I stop up and think about my life situation and how lonely I am and it just depresses me. When I see posts of my peers from high school having moved on to really interesting things in the last 5 years on Facebook I steam with envy inside, especially my best friend who's playing in a band and is 100% going for fame, which... I'm not sure I ever wanted that, but I envy it because I used to want to play music in bands and to climb that ladder some time ago. Gave up because I can't handle any sort of pressure because I'm so anxious, and especially driving and transport which you'll be doing a lot from various different cities as a musician, is just something I can't mentally handle and I don't have the energy to be social in such a lifestyle. Sigh, it's just another vent to add to the list on this subreddit, I know. As usual, I just want to get it out there and hope something positive comes from writing this or the eventual commentary it gets. ",0

czj4ia8,soccer," Personally I've found it's presentational anxiety as an extension of social anxiety. I like the way my mom put it: ""It sounds like you think you have to deliver more than you can."" Lately I've fixed some of my inarticulacy by talking slower and making sure I don't talk unless I have a clear idea how I'm gonna phrase myself. Here's an example of my inarticulacy: I asked a classmate how his exam went 3 years ago. I think I said something like *""So uh, was it real nice, to, you know...? Did you score some points or something, uh?""*. Him and 3 other classmades looked at me, then at each other and bursted out laughing and I was embarrassed and it felt humiliating. I went from that to making decent sentences today, where I'm not pretending to sound smarter than I am, and I'm no longer afraid of making baby sentences like ""This news makes me feel unhappy because I don't like it"". Dunno *how* I just improved. At some point I thought even if I screw up and it's embarrassing, what's keeping me from becoming better? Truth be told though, I just edited this post 3 times just to make it sound semi-coherent and I noticed some trends in my inarticulacy: I have an overuse and a misuse of the word, ""but"". I tend to use it when I'm transitioning into a new sentence before I've figured out what to say so I end up with stuff like ""I'm not really good at sports, but I'm not good at soccer either."" Aside from that I use fillers like ""so much"" and lots of adverbs like ""really"" and ""extremely"" which are often completely (&lt;-) unnecessary. It's basically teen-talk, except I'm 22 and most peers are better than that. ",0
czqm2aq,Grass,"Huh, so the grass really is greener on the other side. This is a phenomena that has worked once for me and was proven wrong other times.nnIt's because you get back to a place physically and also mentally. You're reminded because you cannot unsee the negative annotations from a time when you were in a darker place. Bear in mind, in reality it's all about your perception and not actually the place that is haunted.nnI find it fascinating because it makes me wonder if a concept like a ""curse"" was created from this experience.

d3fp4yj,"run , mountains"," It certainly matters. My father's side is quiet and intellectual as well while my mom's side is quirky and awkward and I sometimes think maybe aspergers run in my family cuz there's such socially backwards and unempathic people there. A thing I've noticed about anxiety and judgement is that as with other forms of comprehension and intellect you overcomplicate what you don't understand. In writing the characters discuss the concepts of the story too directly and in too much detail as if the author was still trying to piece it together as he was writing dialogue, same thing for being social and understanding people. We judge in our heads and form ideas about other people because we truly don't understand them well enough to be calm around them. But remember one can move mountains with enough self awareness and the will to improve. Embrace it and become the best you can be given the cards you're dealt! ",0
d3trott,sun," I've had this since I was a kid. I remember when I was 6 my mom or even my first teacher would keep referring to how I looked and tell me to look at them. My teacher also said ""stop looking angry at me"" when I wasn't even aware that I was doing it... the sun was in the way. Lately I'm doing slightly better, but I still find myself making eye contact with a skeptical sort of half-turned head, and looking away sometimes because something about looking another person in the eye feels like something is missing. I'm supposed to get something that just doesn't happen. Honestly, I'm pretty sure I have autistic traits at the very least, but it could also be that I had ADD. In fact, recently someone confirmed it for me because he blamed me for being interruptive and I told him I feel like it's impulsive and not something I do on purpose, and then someone here on Reddit told me that impulsivity is an ADD trait. Just look at me now, I can barely keep my line of thought coherent. I was supposed to talk about eye contact in relation to you OP, but I keep going left and right, and I never keep a throughline with anything. But to round my comment off, I think that was the point I meant to make about eye contact, at least in my case. I can't keep it because of my inattentiveness. It means I am looking someone in the eye while I'm not fully following what I'm talking to them about because thoughts seep in and out of my consciousness irregularly and I have trouble being focused like other people. Psychologically, lacking eye contact is a sign of dishonesty. In my interpretation of us (the anxious or socially challenged) I think it means that we feel guilty and if you're like me, you're often wearing a mask and pretending to do or say things you think other people wanna hear or you cover for your tracks to hide that you're not living a normal outgoing, easygoing life, so when you talk to someone you can't look them in the eye. You have something you hide and you're afraid they will find out. ",0
d4bmz0u,running ," Hm, this is the kind of situation where I want to say something to help you feel better but I can't really come up with any advice that isn't BS, but I know your situation all too well. Life goes on, and I like to think eventually there comes a situation that grants you with an opportunity of improvement that you take because you have the courage at the time. I don't think ""offing"" yourself is anything courageous though. Try to shut down those thoughts whenever you get them, even if it's really painful to feel like you do. You get nothing out of it and neither does anyone else. I'd rather die of starvation or long-running sickness tbh. ",0
7ofo8g, waves," I almost feel like there's a wall between me and everyone I know/meet. Anyone else?. So for the past year or so I've had waves of social anxiety. It never got too bad cause I would usually force myself to live my life despite it (i.e. going to parties I was scared to go to, hanging out with people I felt really anxious around, striking up conversations when I had nothing to say) and I'm really glad I did this because, along with daily meditation, I can feel myself healing. I'm more comfortable around other people now and I'm no longer scared to initiate hang-outs. However, there's a vague feeling I get whenever I'm spending time with someone (one-on-one). It's like I'm not fully...there. Not connected to them or the world around me, like theres an invisible wall keeping me and my thoughts separated from the rest of the world. I've had situations lately when I'm with someone, and normally (in my pre-anxiety life) it would be a moment of pure connection. I used to be able to have such deep and exciting talks with people, or kiss someone and feel like we're one person. And now, I feel like I kind of ruin similar situations because I'm not present and the ""connection"" never happens like it used to. It becomes a moment of fake connection....we both know that it's kinda awkward and that it feels weird, but we act like we're really clicking, which just makes things feel weirder. Or maybe that's just all in my head. The point is, I'm a little worried this feeling will never pass. I do my best to be present, I sometimes will even meditate a second time if I know I'm about to be hanging out with someone. I try to focus on them and not what's going on in my head, and remind myself hat they're just pointless nagging thoughts that mean nothing at all. But the magic I used to feel when truly enjoying spending time with someone just seems gone now. It's like a chore to chill with a friend for more than the amount of time I was expecting. Just hoping to see who else experiences this disconnected feeling, feels almost like slight derealization, and if its something that changes over time. I try not to resist it but right now I'm just kinda worried that it'll always be there, stopping me from having memorable experiences with people who I truly want to connect with. ",0
9ujfy8,"running , running , bike, riding"," I thought I'd overcome my social anxiety but I just had an anxious moment. Just need to vent.. I was diagnosed with SAD about 7 years ago. I had a few specific thing I was anxious about, the list of which might look familiar to some of you: * Dating-related things * The gym * Being around people who break even the tiniest least enforced rules * Afraid of unfamiliar social situations, mostly anxious about what I should be wearing Anyway, I had gone to see a counsellor and I'd worked through it with some good CBT. Not to brag, but recently I've been exercising at the gym (even using the showers - a big surprise to myself!), asking many girls on dates, I'd gone to a few things overdressed and simply didn't care, and I'd become OK with parking my car in a 60 minute parking stall for 65 minutes. These are all progress for me. Still, there were limits to what I was comfortable with so perhaps I wasn't as over my SAD as I thought I was: * I only invited girls on dates online where I know they are into me * At the gym, I only exercise in the squash courts (practicing hitting the ball and running around the court) and on the running track (usually just 1 other person), and it's hard to do it wrong * Even though marijuana laws weren't really being enforced in Canada pre-legalization, I could never be OK around it until it was recently officially legalized * I was OK with being overdressed to things but not underdressed Anyway, I recently moved into a condo and part of my condo fees go to some fitness equipment we have. This equipment is kind of visible as you drive by and the light of the fitness room was never on so I assumed that no one used it. Finally, a place where I could safely use a weight machine for the first time without worrying about other people also being there! So I got my stuff together and went over. I was trying to swipe in and my swipe card wasn't working. That's when I see a reflection in the glass of a girl behind me. I immediately froze. She was waiting to enter the fitness room too. What are the odds?! It had NEVER been in use before. I said hi and she gave a polite smile and said nothing in return. Obviously she is uncomfortable that I'm there, right? Well, not actually but that's what I was projecting from myself onto her. Better to leave. I made some excuse that my card wasn't working (the truth, but a bad excuse when I could've just asked her to let me in) and then darted back to my condo and wrote this. I thought I'd be OK with a situation like that but I suppose not. Oh well... Thanks for listening. Time to get back on that bike and keep riding! ",0

7l4ely, Hills,"Why am I so gullible?. Even though I generally believe most people are assholes, I still seem to always fall for people's tricks and to trust people I shouldn't. I think I'm overly nice to everyone (even people I dislike) since I'm so lonely and I have no friends. An example of me being really gullible happened today. At work, I signed up for secret santa and got a girl, Ashley, who's kind of annoying, but who never really seemed sneaky or bitchy to me. She had previously asked me who my secret santa was, and of course I had to tell her I wasn't going to tell anyone, since it was her. So i figured she knew it was me. Well last week, Ashley told me she was thinking about getting the girl she got, Brenda, an Anastasia Beverly Hills glow kit for her gift. Ashley asked me for my opinion and asked if she thought Brenda would like it. Now, these glow kits are like $42 and the spending limit for secret santa was $15! I told Ashley it was a good gift, but that it was really expensive. Ashley just said ""I know."" Well, stupid me then felt like I should spend more than $15 on Ashley since she was spending so much on Brenda. I figured Ashley might have been telling me this just so I would get her a better gift, but I thought she would actually get Brenda the glow kit, since Ashley seems to consider Brenda to be a work friend. So, of course I bought Ashley stuff from PINK and spent $30 on her gift. Well today, Brenda opened her gift today at work in front of me and big surprise, it wasn't a glow kit. It was a $10 giftcard and a pair of socks. So Ashley didn't go $1 over the $15 limit. I know it's my fault for not keeping within the limit, but I feel so naiive and gullible! I also feel lame because I feel like Ashley probably told some of our other coworkers her plan and they probably laughed about how stupid I am. How do I become less gullible? and why do people seem to always take advantage of my kindness? It's like what's the point of even trying to overcome social anxiety when all my social interactions result in me being humiliated.",0
dsc4ez3,"riding , run "," I was like this when I first started driving too!! Like you, my Dad ""taught"" me how to drive. He basically didn't teach me anything or explain any driving rules, but would scream at me at the top of his lungs when I wasn't even doing anything wrong. My mom never drove with me and when she did she'd basically be having a panic attack, so she was useless too. When I finally got my license at age 18, I practically had no driving experience. Now I'm almost 21, and I still get nervous about driving, but I no longer cry or freak out. I also think my bad driving has improved over the years. Here are some things I've learned that help: 1) Stop caring about what other drivers think!!! Obviously, you shouldn't drive recklessly, but for me stressing over messing up and about other drivers judging me actually led to me driving poorly. Practice driving at night in low traffic areas to build your confidence. Don't worry about other drivers judging you for making small mistakes or driving too slow, because TONS of people are awful drivers and drive recklessly on purpose. Also something I used to do was obsessively stare at the person behind me in my rearview because I was worried about anyone riding my ass. If you do this too, try to stop because it's really distracting! 2) Slow Down I know you didn't mention this, but I used to have an issue where I would brake too late/turn too fast because again I was worried about the person behind me. You will be a better driver if you slow down and drive carefully, instead of speeding when you're already uncomfortable with driving. 3) Play relaxing music I find it really helps me if I have music I like on to distract me from any panicked thoughts. 4) Remember everyone makes driving mistakes Humans aren't perfect, and that's the reason car accidents happen. Don't beat yourself up over it, just remind yourself to learn from your mistakes. People run red lights, turn when they're not supposed to, cut people off, etc. Just try to pay attention to traffic lights and double check whenever you are turning or changing lanes. 5) Observe others I find it really helpful to closely watch someone who is driving me around (if they're a good driver.) I just observe their driving techniques and think about how said person drives the next time I drive myself. This sounds kind of weird, but it does help me. It also helped me to read online about driving tips for new drivers. 6) Get more sleep and don't drive if you are overtired or extremely stressed I don't know if this applies to you, but if I don't sleep enough I drive terribly. I start to make careless and stupid mistakes. For example, while sleep deprived I have backed into a parking ramp pole, went over curbs while turning, and even rear ended someone because I was looking behind me (trying to get onto thruway while at a yield sign) and forgot to look in front of me. I hope I helped a little bit, and please don't beat yourself up over making a mistake! ",0
mmx9a1,"swimming, swimming, swimming"," From( I cant pick up this call) to (Hey, you messed up my order). So, for the past some time I wanted to share my story with you guys. It saddens me to see many people struggling so much with SA. First of all, believe me those who say that ""SOCIAL ANXIETY CANT BE CURED, YOU JUST LEARN TO LIVE WITH IT"" are just spitting out bullshit. Social Anxiety is 100% curable. The best and worst part of our mind is that it is so easy to wire something in our limbic system. You can rewire your limbic to act differently. So now the story time: So, I was that shy kid who was raised by narcissists and bullied all his life. My social anxiety was so bad that I couldnt even answer phone calls or open the door when the door bell was rung. I just dreaded getting out of my house. How it all changed? I started therapy and medicines(they are way too important than you think, consider them as a swimming tube which you are gonna use to learn swimming, yes they are TEMPORARY!!!!) I started doing a sales job for UNICEF, where I had to pitch random strangers on streets to donate for a cause. My trainer used to be with me all the time. In the training they taught us that 8 out of 10 will reject you rudely and its okay. It happened 3-4 times when I went blank while delivering my pitches. But my trainer was supportive. I kept on doing it and eventually I was able to deliver full pitch without fumbling. Then the next issue was handling rejection. Some of them used to be very rude. Ofc I was hurt by all this. But my trainer told me a thing, that when someone is being rude to you it shows their character not yours. You will find such people in every aspect of your life. You should learn to ignore them. You should say thank you to people even if they abuse you. I really liked this point. You know what? When this happened, I really got a boost of self esteem, like I am better than so many people here. Most of them are short tempered and will just blast at even the smallest fights. They cant do this what I am doing. And once this happened, there was no stopping. I just got better and better and finally I succeeded in getting a donation. That was the time I left the job. Because sales was never the job I wanted to do, I went there to get rid of my fears. And after this talking to people and not giving a fuck about what others think of me is just child's play. I can do things which even normal people can't do. Always remember, if you ask this question, ""What is the best job for socially anxious people?"" You will never be able to get out of this hell. Just go and fight it. I know its not easy but thats why I mentioned about swimming tube :) I hope this will help someone Thanks for reading if you made it till here😊 DMs always open if you want to talk about anything or want advice ",0
7aow0h,"bench, bench"," Met a cute stranger this morning but couldn't bring myself to even just say hello.. Please note that right now I just want friends since I don't have any: I go to university and commute there on light rail. This Friday morning at 7:30 am I met this stranger also waiting for the light rail, and I'm ugly, so naturally she stood at some distance away. But then I decided to sit down on this bench while waiting, and she did the same (but at another nearby bench). I got on the train , found an empty seat, and she got on and sat at the empty seats next (there were empty seats next to me but at a distance) Unlike most people, she wasn't on her phone nor did she appear to listen to music with earbuds. Just like me, staring off into space looking out the window, her feets raised up onto the seat opposite her. Based on first impressions, she seemed like a cool person to get to know.. I regret not even saying hello at least, but this was the first time I even saw her. I can barely even talk to people in general, not to mention total strangers. The semester is almost over anyways so I don't expect to see her for a second time, and even if I do, what can I do? I know it would be creepy cold approaching another person. It's just a dumb infatuation, most likely overthinking this and this doesn't mean anything. But how can I get to know certain strangers like her, if social anxiety prevents me from initiating a conversation? Thank you if you read this... ",0

In the morning at school, I was sitting on a bench upstairs waiting for the bell to ring so I could go to my first class. Near every bench on the second floor has a stairway next to it, so sometimes people are walking up there and they see you sitting on the bench. Every time I heard someone coming up the stairs, I basically froze. My focus shifted away from my phone and I kept thinking about the person walking up the stairs and how they’d see me sitting there. When people walk past me or behind me, I become subconscious of the way I might look to them, even if they look at me for a second. I usually twitch or shake when this happens and my breathing always hitches. Usually I can prevent this by fidgeting or kicking my feet... but I feel like doing so sends a message to the person that I’m uncomfortable with their presence. This happens everyday and I can’t control it. help ",0

d482pp,shore," Crippling social anxiety. Background: I just moved to the states from Germany, my social anxiety is pretty terrible in public I feel like I’m always tweaking or look like I’m on drugs because I’m constantly trying to try things that will stimulate my brain enough to forget about the anxiety or to “look normal”. This tends to be muscle spasms I’ll jerk my head which really makes me look crazy sometimes I try to control it but it gets worse. This makes me not even really want to socialize with anyone or even find a job because of this. The same with my family there’s no one that I don’t have this problem with and it’s really uncomfortable that I just pretty much plan alone or want to be alone as I accepted I’ll stay like this. Talking to women is a whole other issue it just makes me depressed because a little part of me wants to date again and try to grow into a bigger person, but past relationships have really took the toll on me so I thought it would be a better decision to stay out of them as for it can make things mentally emotionally complicated. So I have even a bigger fear for women and I don’t want to feel this way I’m at the point where I don’t even feel masculine because I’m just weak incapable. Question My question is have any of you been this far out from shore, and if so what have to done to combat it therapy’s or medication? Would really like to be a functioning normal human being again.

filh0hb," tree,  tree"," So I am going for multiple reasons. I felt ""down"" for quiet a long time. I haven't gotten a clear diagnosis on what it exactly is but it is either depression, social anxiety, autism or a mixture of all of them. Don't know for sure. I started going to counseling begining this year because I had a breakdown phase at the end of last year and it was not the first time but the first time I am financially capable of getting help. The first session was mainly introduction. She told me what she studied and how her therapy works and I explained why I reached out for counceling and explained briefly who I am and what I do. The following week we started with my family tree and the relationships I have with the people in my live. I always thought yeah it was not soo bad and other people probably had it worse but my first session we talked about family I started sobbing about a topic I thought was not a big deal at all. The third session we mainly talked about what happend the week before, how I felt during the week and why that happend. The 4th week we continued with the familly tree. Last week we started with my ""life line"". We talk about how I grew up, ho school was like, what I used to do, who my friends were and so on. It's nothing crazy yet but it helps her to understand who I am and why I am how I am. Even if I just had about 5 sessions yet we already filpped some stones and I really think we are getting somewhere. Not like ""hey you're cured and life is perfect now"". But in a better direction. My psychologist helps me to cope with feelings and how to approach situations and explains to me why I might feel how I feel and links that to my stories about childhood and fears and stuff and it really helps to calm down in situations where I usually get anxious, clamed up or can't think of anything to say. Most of them know what they are doing and will try to find out how to help you best and even if it just gets a little bit better it is still a piece of life quality you might gain out of it. ",0
5cykn6, hill,"Im 21, driving test in a week, way too nervous. I've always had SA, and the past year or so has been really good to me, but now thay I'm trying to get my license, it's coming back. I'm taking my third driving test next Tuesday. I know I can drive. I've driven unlicensed since I turned 18. A couple months ago, I took a cross-country road trip with no issues on my learner's permit. I failed twice already, once during parking, and the second time for going 5 over down a hill (instructor said I was a perfect driver other than that). The last test was 4 years ago, when I was 17. I'm just so afraid that I'm going to get failed for something as trivial as that and never get the courage to test again. It would just be the nail in the coffin at that point. I don't get why I'm so nervous. I'm in a metal band and we're playing a show three days before my test, and I feel completely confident in getting on stage and rocking in front of forty or so people, but the thought of being failed by one person is keeping me in a constant and uncomfortable manic state. I guess I just need reassurance that I'm not gonna be failed by some guy or lady trying to take more money from a helpless NEET.",0

qcxzfn, waves," i'm getting better!. After months of therapy, moving to university and weirdly enough,, hair dye I can finally say my SA is becoming something I ""had"" rather than ""have"". I've had some form of SA for most of my life, which only seemed to get worse to the point where I was physically unable to speak to people, even if I wanted to, had anxiety attacks on the daily and seemed to plan my life around avoiding people as much as possible. School was a living nightmare and I spent years isolating myself from people, so buried in all the fears my SA told me that I didn't believe recovery was possible. I don't need to list all the ways SA made me feel trapped - you already know - but I spent so many years not talking to people that, even when I wanted to recover, I didn't think I even knew *how to.* I didn't know how to have a conversation with a stranger anymore. But I'm happy to say it's been a few years since that point. Moving to university was something I was so excited yet terrified to do because as much as I wanted a fresh start I was convinced I'd fall back into old patterns of isolation. But after being lucky enough to get access to a therapist for around 8 months I started to be able to heal. I've made some great friends at university and for the first time in my life I finally feel like I can be myself in a way I didn't think was possible. I can *talk* to people. Even doing simple things like being able to say hello to my classmates or buying something in a shop was something I couldn't even dream of doing at one point, let alone going to social events with the intention of meeting new people! I've had friends be shocked when I've told them I had SA and people ask me how I have the confidence to do certain things, and after spending so much of my life wanting to ask the same question, it's wild to be on the receiving end. (Although, my answer is often a combination of therapy and dying my hair bright pink - having a unnatural hair colour forced me out of my comfort zone and made me learn how to tolerate being \~perceived\~ very quickly!) It's definitely not completely gone, I still get waves of panic and I don't even know where to begin with thinking about giving in person presentations but I'm not planning my life around avoidance. Somehow, sheer stubbornness has allowed me to not let SA stop me from doing things I want to do and my life is so much better for it. This got longer than I intended but since I genuinely never believed i would get to this point I wanted to share. Recovery is possible and one day you'll be able to do the things you'd like to do. I'm sending all my love to everyone in this subreddit, your success stories inspired me to create my own &lt;33 ",0
egidwf6," nature, outside "," Honestly, it *could* help if you use it as an opportunity to work on yourself and your social anxiety, and take advantage of the fact that your schedule is more flexible (so you can seek e.g. therapy at any time of the day). However, because of the nature of social anxiety, it's probably a lot more likely to make things *so much worse* for you. I had pretty mild social anxiety in high school, but then I did a stint of online school in my last couple years. Being socially anxious, I didn't exactly seek out social groups and such in my free time, and I'd often go days/weeks without interacting with anyone outside of my immediate family. When I graduated, my social anxiety was so much worse. I couldn't hold down a job. I'd go into the back room and cry my eyes out after being put on register and then get fired. lol When I finally found a job, it took me months to feel semi-comfortable around the people I was working with 5 days a week. It was probably over a year before I felt like I *maybe* belonged there. I really wish I hadn't gone to online school. Being isolated for so long was really, really bad for me and to be honest I haven't fully fixed the extra social anxiety that came with it. ",0

ftfu5i7,breeze," I'm also 18. Idk if this will help much...I had a job at Subway for literally 2 days, but found myself focused in the work and not really paying attention to what would normally bother me. I've heard people say to always keep focused on something to keep anxiety at bay but didn't truly realize it until then. I had to quit because the food repulsed me and I started taking harder college classes (while in highschool). Also didn't have a ride to get there lol. I do ticketing at seasonal events now and find the same thing happening to me. The anxiety is still in the back of my head, but when working so face paced, it was like it was put on hold. Don't remember most of the nights I worked just because of how quick things went, so nothing for my anxious brain to continuously replay at night. The initial anxiety of getting the job is going to be absolutely horrible, I'm not going to lie, but when engaging in the job itself, you may surprise yourself. I sure surprised myself. I had horrible social and general anxiety and was floored when I realized I relatively breezed through the nights. Something that helped me was having prepared basic phrases to say. Greetings, responses to common questions, etc. There's also online work. I think U-Haul hires a ton of teens to do at home work that consists of taking calls and entering in information. It could be a good first step. EDIT: Wanted to add that it could be a good time to apply right now. Even though it may be hard to find one, because of the virus most interviews I hear will just be over the phone. My interview at Subway all that time ago went well.

Driving was a necessity for me because we don't even have the option of public transportation. I was *really* nervous at first as well. However, it's really not as bad as I thought it was. Try it out. I didn't have much experience beforehand, just arcade games (don't assume driving it like this at all) and a riding lawnmower. If driving in the city makes you nervous (I don't what environment you live in exactly), ask to go out to the country, drive some back roads and long stretches of roads. Try to make sure to avoid bad weather conditions the first couple times you drive, even rain, because that traumatizes me a lot. People will probably get angry and honk. Road rage is unavoidable. However, as long as you know the laws and follow the rules, there is no way you are in the wrong. Though it still shakes me up every time someone does it. I like to use the philosophy ""better safe than sorry"". Worry about yourself but be aware of the other cars around you. The only times I got close to getting into accidents was because the other people around me were driving dumb. Also, make sure if you're going to do the whole driving thing, that you do it for you, not for anyone pressuring you, and make sure the time is right for you. I know many people who make it work without a license. One of the things I love most about driving is the freedom it brought me. I can leave any situation when I want to, control my own schedule, and another plus is driving gives me the alone time that I love so much. ",0

adl9qq,sun," HYPER self consciousness. Hello friends! I have BPD, GAD, social anxiety, OCD and depression (a PERFECT tinder bio if anyone is looking for one) and recently I have found myself going into somewhat of a downward spiral where I literally cannot say ANYTHING without thinking twice about it. It's hard to explain, but I have approximately 2-3 close friends, and I have become so hyper aware of everything I say around them/what I text them/the memes I send them that I have found myself cutting down how much I interact with them because I am terrified that everything I say or write to them is annoying/embarrassing/TMI/boring/cringe-y/narcissistic/vain/silly/dumb/stupid. Everything I say goes through a filter that goes something like ''Why did I just say that? If someone else said that to me I'd judge them and think that that was a stupid thing to say so now literally everyone in this room is probably sitting there thinking ''God, she's so fucking annoying and cringe-y''. I literally can't even text my friend ''Hey how are you doing lately I haven't heard from you in a while'' without LITERALLY having a nervous breakdown, crying and losing control over myself because I feel that I am bothering her (I'm a female with only female friends) or she thinks I'm annoying or she's avoiding me on purpose. I HONESTLY feel as if I am losing my mind. I am TERRIFIED (as you probably can tell) about losing my friends, and the logical part of my brain is telling me that this is silly and erratic and overly dramatic and they're most likely NOT thinking these things but everything in me is screaming that I am a worthless loser that they all just somehow tolerate. I have tried it all, I've tried affirmations, I'm on meds, I've tried meditation, I've tried positive thinking, I've tried therapy, I've read every self help''YOU ARE A BADASS YOU'RE AMAZING LOVE YOURSELF'' book under the sun, I try to talk sense into myself but it all just comes back to my low self-worth and my extreme hatred of myself. The crazy thing is I come from a stable household with parents that adore me and I adore them and I've never gone hungry or cold or without love or affection. WHAT I AM ASKING IS, does anyone else feel this way? Is anyone this hyper self-critical and self conscious and self aware to the point where they can barely function?

78rs32,basketball," My tinder experience. Ok, im writing this here just to get this crap outta my chest. Im a virgin kisless 18 year old guy with social anxiety who out of total desperation, decided to give tinder a try, just to try and see if any girls in the universe found me attractive. I consider myself to be decently looking, because although im a tad short (175 cms) and skinny i do have handsome facial features and a pretty consistent beard for my age. Once i installed the app, i put a couple of nice photos, and my bio consisted of my hobbies (basketball, shows etc) and the fact that i study engineering. I swiped right on every single girl that my screen lit up, and got a couple matches with girls i just didnt find merely attractive, no offense to them. However, during a late night swiping session, i found the profile of a pretty geeky redhead who, although not being stunningly beautiful, there was something about her that i found very attractive, so i super liked her. After half an hour or so later, bam, she liked back. The very next morning we started texting. As i had expected, she was geeky and quirky, and i can say that i had never felt so comfortable speaking or texting with another female. I flirted with her very smoothly and naturally, and she flirted back nearly every time. After a few hours of convo i realised how insecure of a girl she probably was, and the fact that she insinuated a couple times that she hadnt been on a relationship before. In order to get her number, we played a game in which i earned the digits of her number by making punny jokes or smoothly delivered compliments or snapbacks at one of her jokes. After a couple days, i was up to 6 of the 9 digits of her number, when after a very deep convo about the meaning of her favourite song, she suddenly started not texting back. Its been 2 and a half days now of no contact, and im at the fringe of sending her a text saying that we had great chemistry, and it would be a lost of opportunity not continuing with this, but if she indeed didnt want to continue, to at least tell me why. Phew, that was a lot. What should i do? ",0

Just to put things in perspective, I am 19F who still has a curfew at 8pm or whenever the sun sets. I’m only allowed to hang out with friends at least once a week (if i’m lucky) and at a 10 miles radius. My parents honestly don’t think it’s important for me to socialize as I should be more focused on school and that should be my only main focus. I didn’t even go to a university because my parents didn’t think I was ready and that it was too dangerous for me to go so I ended up going to a community school that is close to home instead. The school spirit is dead in my community school and I find it harder to socialize with people because of the lack of clubs and interest others have in socializing. Honestly the only people I interact with are my friends from high school but I feel like our relationships are slowly fading away because I barely get to hangout with them since my parents rarely let me out… I wasn’t even allowed to get a job a for a while because my parents didn’t think I was mature enough until I recently applied to one without them knowing, they weren’t very pleased about it and want me to quit. It is also difficult when trying to bring this subject up to them because they always end up telling me how ungrateful I am for them wanting me to be safe. I do understand that and I even feel guilty whenever I think about defying my parents rules because I do know they just want me safe but as I am getting older I want at least a little sense of freedom. I want to become more independent and get over my social anxiety as well but it’s really difficult when my parents continue to keep me in a bubble. I honestly don’t know how I will be able to function properly once I am out in the real world because of the bubble my parents put me in. I just need some advice or anything to help me properly confront this situation. ",0
9s4vv6,river,"I used to have extreme social anxiety and it was because of my paranoid mother.. I [22f] used to have extreme social anxiety, but in the last 4 years I have been able to conquer it. I still have days where I'll mildly suffer from it but it's sort of rare now. The reason I had it was because growing up my mom was overprotective of my brother [25m] and I. Now my brother suffers from it. He rarely leaves the house and when we try to get him to go to events, even family ones, he refuses to go. It wasn't until last year that I realized why I was always afraid of social settings. One example from childhood, that I'll never forget, when my mom overreacted was when I was with 2 friends of mine. We walked to the store, which wasn't far from my house, to get some snacks. When we came back not even 10 minutes after leaving, my mom was in panic and one of my mom's friends was with my mom as well. I remember her saying ""what if you ended up like that girl who they found in a suitcase in pieces in a river because I didn't know where you were?"" After that day my 2 friends barely came over anymore and stopped coming over completely soon after. My friend's mom was agreeing with my mom which didn't help at all. I had to learn that life was too short to not take even minimum risk or to live a fearful life.",0

dc9ye4b,mountain," I understand you and I have been in the same situation. Especially the fact that you think about killing yourself is a big warning signal that you should go to a therapist or at least get some help (like you did by writing here)... (Like you I've been bullied at school but my family situation was correct (no divorce) even if my family is very special (my parents have almost no friends and I lived in our house far away from other houses, isolated, almost had no examples of ""normal"" social interactions), now I'm 25 and finishing university (also a complex situation) but I have no close friend, never had a GF and I'm almost afraid to talk to anyone... but still I'm happy that I am able to finish university soon and could get a stable situation in a near future (and that's when I plan to have a GF and maybe have my own family...) but still I'm unhappy, it feels like I missed those years, I missed some young love, didn't have fun and things like that... and at the end I always found an excuse to not try to cure my social anxiety or at least try to have more self confidence.... :/ ) So, unlike me, go to a therapist if you can, do activities, raise your own self confidence and push yourself to do those things that matters to you like getting your driving licence, step by step, the GF is only one of those steps, you shouldn't think about the whole mountain you will have to climb, only that it will be a succession of small stairs when you look at them individualy... (sorry if my english isn't that good, it is not my native language...). Good luck!! ",0
hfa4tb,ocean," Moving across the ocean with social anxiety. I currently live in Hawaii with my sister but due to financial troubles and how the world is right now we are moving back to our hometown in mainland USA. For the last week I have been nonstop on the phone with people trying to get shit figured out. Movers, banks, vet, insurance, etc. I am burnt out and want nothing more than to hide in my room all day with my phone turned off and to not talk to a single person for at least a week. I had one of the worst panic attacks I’ve had in a while this morning and I just want it to be over. Anyway this was just a rant. I needed to let it out to people who understand how I feel and can empathize rather than calling me a baby and telling me to just get it done. ",0

d56n5u7,sun," Pretty cool once you make those connections, right? I've also had another theory about their albums. Wish You Were Here is a side story about the same character and the same life as in The Wall, however, its early on, when he started drifting apart from reality and decided to follow his dreams of becoming a known guitarist/singer. When you listen to both albums, you know from the lyrics that both characters are named Pink Floyd, and both are at least musicians. In The Wall, during *One of My Turns*, the woman is impressed by a collection of guitars in the room and, just a minute later, the lyrics say ""In the suitcase on the left you'll find my favorite axe"" (*axe* being a guitar). In the other album, during *Have A Cigar* we're told about songs hitting the top of the charts. In the same song, we know the speaker is some kind of producer as he's trying to get the band to sign a contract. However, he seems more interested in Pink than the rest of the band member, probably because he is the band member that plays the guitar and sings. If we cross reference the albums, *Shine On You Crazy Diamond Pt.1-5* is the teenage years (just about to hit adulthood) and it is set in the mind of Pink, which tells him to follow his dreams. The song also says ""Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun [...] now there is a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky"" which could indicate the song is situated after *Mother* but before *One of My Turns* because the character isn't young anymore, and the wall already started building in his mind, and *Mother* is all about a child and an overprotective mother that helps build the wall. Then *Welcome to the Machine* is about hitting adulthood and actually going through with following his dreams, which should be located in the same range as the previous song. *Have A Cigar* is the point where he goes solo and has to move to America. We know from The Wall that the character is alone over there and he finds his wife cheating on him and abandonning him while trying to reach her by phone. *Wish You Were Here* is the moment when he tries to reach to her but she never answers because she abandonned him, but before he discovers she's cheating on him, as that is the final phase of the brick insertion in the wall and then its full isolation, whilst this song still has a *sane* tone. *Shine On You Crazy Diamond Pt.6-9* is there to signify that the character doesn't have the same mentality as in the beggining of the album as that now he's famous but lonely. Could also be the use of meds which changed his personnality like in The Wall (from *Comfortably Numb*). Sorry for the long comment, just thought it was interesting to share this too. :S ",0
90jyeu,"run , run , outdoors"," Wish i could run away. I'm not sure if this counts as anxiety or depression, maybe a little of both. I'm a 21 year old male I have never been told i have anxiety or depression, but have recently been wishing i could run away. I don't quite know how to describe it, I have a perfectly fine life, but i feel so stressed out and trapped. I just feel like I'm stuck in my routines, I dread at the thought of dealing with people, or how they might respond to things i do and say. I sit down and cry sometimes, I just can't stand myself i feel like a failure and someone that nobody wants around. I just wish i could run far far away and start over. I don't know where i would run to, or how i would support myself with only the stuff i could carry with me, or how i would deal with the dangers of being alone outdoors (dangerous wild animals, people that wish harm, etc). I just want to be alone and away from everything! This isn't the first time i have felt like this before tho. I remember a few years back when i was a young teen i wanted to run away to a place 3 states away. I never thought about the logistics of it or the shear distance this place was away. I had the escape planned out tho. In the middle of the night while everyone was asleep, i would slip out my window and run/walk in that general direction to daytime. I even looked at all the ways i could go on google earth, and had all my stuff i thought was important to me packed into a bag. I never attempted tho, But those feelings are coming back again now, and i just don't know what to do. I thought about doing a ""controlled escape"" just taking some time off work and fulfilling these wishes in a controlled way for a little while, just as maybe something to act it out in a safe manner, and maybe help get these ideas of out my head, I don't know maybe that would make it worse. I don't know how i would manage that either. I just don't even know anymore.. ",0
cynyhvs,"run , mountain"," That's cool, easing yourself in is a very good strategy I believe. I'm currently looking to join some real life social groups as a casual way of easing myself into the whole one-on-one dating thing. I've been down the pills route and yes the effects fade after you become dependant on them which kinda sucks but is better for you in the long run I think. I have been prescribed propanalol from my Doctor which simply lowers my heart rate slightly as a way of calming my body down under stress and it's very good for one off situations when I need it most. Public speaking was very up and down for me. In high school it was basically a no go, I was a complete mess. At university I studied Graphic Design and the course structure involved everyone getting an initial brief, creating a design and then pitching it to the class as if they were your clients. That was about 2-3 times a month every month for first 2 years of the course! D: I never ever wanted to do it but my tutor was right when he said it's something that we all needed to learn in order to make it in our chosen field. Sometimes I would do really well, I was confident, relaxed and everything flowed nicely. Other times it would all go off the rails from the moment I opened my mouth. There was almost no way to tell how it go unfortunately for me. But I will say that the absolute WORST feeling in a group scenario is waiting your turn. There's no better way to build up anxiety than watching your turn slowly creep closer and closer until it's right next to you whilst you sit there helpless like something out of a horror movie. If you get the chance I would strongly recommend going first and getting it over with. Don't give your SA the chance to play on your mind. The next best thing is probably going last but only because by that point everyone's usually stopped paying attention, haha. But hey I did get through every single presentation somehow and overall I would say it did help with my public speaking but I'm still not great at it even though it's now part of my actual job. The slightest thing can still throw me off but I'm definitely better at recovering now than I used to be which in a way is even more of an achievement. Just another mountain I must climb. ",0
cyq06xs,Nature ,"Ah but that's the beauty of it. Once you make eye contact with someone you've both successfully acknowledged each others' presence and are ready to move on and proceed with your day. It doesn't feel like you're ignoring them because you've already made that connection. It's like moving over so someone can sit next to you on the bus. You might get a quick ""excuse me"" and ""thank you"" out of it but you're not kidding yourselves into thinking you're best buds. It's just a mutual understanding between two people in a very basic sense. Every time you make eye contact with a stranger you're just saying to each other ""I'm aware of you, you're aware of me, and now we're both aware of each other. Carry on as normal."" It doesn't have to be any more complicated than that.nnRemember, we're all just animals wandering around the Earth looking out for danger.

czj54j5,bay," I'm actually pretty articulate but it comes and goes depending on how anxious I'm feeling. My problem is, when I know there's a word I want to use but I can't think of it I struggle to find an alternative. Most of the time I could say it in a simpler way but I become obsessed with that one word I know expresses my thought perfectly but is stuck on the tip of my tongue, so effectively my mind goes blank. The more anxious I'm feeling the harder it is to think on my feet and keep the conversation going. It's still difficult to control but I'm working on it. I've found that reading and also writing regularly (mostly in the form of reddit comments) helps keep my vocabulary refreshed, which allows me to express myself more fluently and in turn keeps my anxiety at bay.

dji241i,Grass,"I used to and I know where you're coming from. It's difficult to swallow that sometimes someone just doesn't reciprocate your friendship. But, you have to remember that with every request, there will always be a chance for rejection. That's real life. Not everyone will like you, but some people definitely will, and those are the ones you should focus on. Not those who you don't get along with, because why force something that doesn't feel right? You'd feel awful your entire life.nnSocial media is great, it brings people together, but you shouldn't put too much weight on it. It's almost always just a front, not the bigger picture. I've struggled with my fair share of self-esteem issues (and social anxiety) in the past, but the grass will always seem greener on the other side, there's always someone who's going to seem smarter, prettier, richer, more athletic, more friendly, but that's them and there's you. Try not to aim to be someone you wish to be, to be friends with people you want to be, that's almost always just a shallow idealization of you/them created in your mind. It isn't real.nnTry to also not control your college experience too much. I find that the deepest friendships form near your 3rd or 4th year, not during freshman orientation. Strike up a conversation when appropriate, but don't control the situation. Friendship doesn't happen overnight, I know it's hard to remember that when you no longer have your HS buddies around.nnTL;DR: I used to, but social media isn't a reflection of real life. Followers don't define your worth. Friendship takes time, but never force something you'd be miserable in.",0

I ran to the restroom and just sit there, you had no idea how many people were there. They had their relatives coming in there too, I don't know why I thought that as awful. Fuck, I hope nobody's seen me. There were 15 people calling. I simply turned off my phone and cover my ears (I don't know why, I did that!). I came out of the closet, and it was afternoon. Everyone was gone and I figured the coast was clear, I took off. As I arrived home, I slammed the door and ran to the bed and covered myself with a blanket. What the fuck just happened?

I’ve never had nightmares like they do in the movies, mine always involve people, ordinary people interacting with me. For instance today I dreamt that I was at a dinner party where I knew nobody, as we were taking our seating I chose to talk to those seated around me, they were friends with each other and seemed extroverted and friendly. Throughout the dream they slowly start to realise that I’m all the worse things that I think about myself, that I’m a freak, a loner, a person no one likes to be around, someone who never has friends because he doesn’t deserve them. At the end they confront me, they tell me they tried being nice but can’t pretend to become friends with me and I needed to leave cause I’m someone who belongs alone, it’s in my nature. My heart breaks, I leave and outside walk alone in the rain until I wake up. I wake up still hurting from the dream, still scared that it’s the reality.

rbybrj," walk,  stream"," cried in in front of everyone in my college class while presenting a project AGAIN and i’m humiliated. i’m so humiliated. I am literally such a fucking overgrown baby when I’m supposed to be an adult in college. This has happened every time I have to speak in front of a group since I was 14- I’m 22 now. But since taking time off from college and then with covid, I haven’t had to do this in 2 years. I actually thought it would be fine because I didnt feel that nervous for it and I’m on ssris now. but then I felt the anxiety coming on and it just got worse as I was waiting for my group’s turn. I kept trying to calm myself down with breathing, water, a short walk and looking at pics of my cat. but once i stood up in front of the class it started again. I couldn’t control the tears so I left the room and cried a little and then tried to calm down my breathing and came back in the room to say present my part since I was speaking last in my group. I went back because I was determined not to give up, I needed to prove to myself I could do this so the panic attacks stop. I thought if I controlled my breathing I could still talk and get though it. well as soon as i opened my mouth i started crying again. i cpuld barely even choke out “sorry”. and then i fucking stops there with tears streaming down my face during the rest of class. no one even looked at me after. i said sorry to my group after and they didn’t even respond. i must be so weird to them. I’m so embarrassed to be me. i’m so pathetic. I made everyone soo fucking uncomfortable like always. I’m literally a freak. Why do I even try anything… I should have taken a zero and never gotten up there. i don’t care if i’ll never see these people again after this class, it’s still so shameful that this is who I am, this is what the world sees when they look at me. idk how i’m gonna do 5+ more years of schooling and then enter a career when I can’t say 2 sentences need to a group of 10 people. sorry this is long, idk who to tell. i kinda don’t want to talk ever again lol, literally despise myself.

d919uhx," waves,  waves,  waves"," You're not going to like the first one but... **1.Getting out of your comfort zone** You have to force yourself to do things. I know it's hard. But little things. Like yesterday I forced myself to go to Chipotle. Unfortunately, nobody grows when in their comfort zone. When I first started working, I was unbelievably awkward. Like. **Customer**: ""Thanks for help"" **Me**: ""You too. Wait no...I don't know why I said that."" **Customer**: ""Don't worry about it."" It took me a few months before I learned how to respond to people lol. I still fuck up here and there but for the most part it's fine. I know I'm not telling you anything you haven't heard before... **2. Meditation and Matcha** It does take practice. Personally, I haven't been the most habitual mediator. But I notice that when I don't meditate, my mind becomes fogged up with thoughts and is just very loud. A few weeks ago someone recommended **Matcha green tea**. Which I tried and It does help to reduce anxiety. I feel much more comfortable with myself throughout the day. During our normal waking activities, our brain produces Beta brain waves. When we meditate and enter a more relaxed state, that is when our brain starts emitting Alpha waves. A slower frequency. This allows for information to move across more easily between two hemispheres of the brain.(Also why it's important to relax when taking a test). It is said that Matcha green tea increases our Alpha waves so you could give the tea a try. &gt; I seem to go through phases where I can make great progress ?and it appears that I'm turning a corner. But then I somehow regress back into full blown anxiety within a day. I just can't seem to break this pattern. This is what I believe is called **spontaneous recovery.** I get this a lot too. It feels like your efforts have wort nothing. They only way to combat it is to keep challenging yourself. I hope this had at least some value. I know you've probably heard it all before. It sounds like you're going through an incredibly rough time. I wish you best. ",0

f0w3sqy,"run , ocean, Surf ,  waves"," A way to deal with ”pain” or negative situations, feelings, thoughts etc is to not see them as a threat or danger. What we so often get tricked to think in the society today is that, you need to do that or that to be happy. Yes, happiness is the meaning of everything, change you thought from negative to positive. What we get from all this is a false acceptation, we trick ourself to think it is ok, and if i do this it will get better but it all just ends in you suppressing emotions, that bites back stronger and stronger for every time you surpress them. This is often a underlying cuase of social anxiety. If you right now see yourself as this anxious/awkward person, then dont change it. BUT dont judge yourself for it, it’s OK to have negative thought and it’s OK to have negative feelings and it’s impossible to controll them. Like a fight you will never win, it will just tear you down. Negative thoughts is needed to be human and are as important as positive thoughts. Feelings might be overwhelming, think of them as a wave. You cant run in to the ocean and stop the way, it’s impossible, so what do you do? Surf on the waves, let yourself truly feel the anxiety and it’s neither bad or good, it’s just there a similar feeling as you get when you get hungry, you get anxiety and when you dont see it as a problem it slowly fades away and you can be yourself and focus on much more important things in life.

e3uot92, tree," This may not help you but I'm just going to add some discussion on the topic. Depersonalization is a weird one for me. I often feel it in unfamiliar situations, mostly due to how unaccustomed I am to what's happening and how unbelievable it is that I'm part of it. I don't know if anxiety really triggers it so much, though I do suffer from social anxiety (not as crippling as a lot of people on this sub, but definitely not fun to live with). It does seem to pop up pretty often when I'm depressed. Depersonalization is a thing I kind of ponder over too. I just remove myself from everything and look blankly at my own reality and see just how bizarre and pointless everything seems, so it's not exclusive to the types of situations you're talking about. It doesn't really happen enough to me to be a hindrance, though I'm sure it's a huge problem for a lot of people. I know it's a common effect of high stress and mental conditions like PTSD, In my own experience though, I've found it interesting more than anything honestly. I definitely relate to this post though, I'm 17 in Junior year and I went on a date a few months back (my first and hopefully not my last) and I just couldn't believe I was really there. Sitting across from this beautiful girl, having a great conversation with her and really feeling compatibility (she friend-zoned me a few days later).

6cu47k,"riding,  waves,  waves"," Ups and Downs Are Part of the Process. People often tell me that in their battle with social anxiety, one day they will go out and score a major victory, such as asking a girl they like for her number, raising their hand and speaking up in a staff meeting or even going out of the house where they felt unable to before. But then they often find the next day or some time later, they feel unable to do something, which had felt quite comfortable for them before. They feel deflated, defeated and often despondent. In my own experience, I remember I would feel like I was riding high on the crest of a wave of confidence often for days, weeks or even months at a time. Then I would seem to suddenly come crashing down face first onto a pile of rocks as I had an anxiety attack, “public breakdown” or some other kind of agonising setback. It was years of these constant ups and downs that (without wishing to be melodramatic or depressive) even led me to contemplate suicide. Not out of some grandiose Kurt Cobain-style, shotgun-to-the-head, “Fuck you!” to the world, but more out of seeking a simple, quiet escape from the sheer mental and physical exhaustion of high, followed by “breakdown”, followed by building myself back up from the ground up, followed by “public breakdown”. By the way, it should be noted here that what I mean by “public breakdown” is written from my perspective at the time. They seemed very public and very crushing at the time, but externally appeared only as my face turning slightly pale and me losing my composure a little. I know this because one such episode happened while I was being filmed for a class as part of my masters degree. I was actually amazed to see how little of my “episode” was objectively apparent. There is nothing from the video footage to suggest the almost uncontrollable pounding of my heart, the tunnel vision, the total mind blank, dizziness and giddying, almost surreal self consciousness I felt internally. This footage actually became a useful reminder and technique for dealing with social anxiety and anxiety attacks, as it showed me how unnoticeable the effects are externally to other people. When we are having such an attack, we almost believe that it is becoming a public spectacle and everyone can see exactly what is going on. But as with so much of social anxiety, most people have no inclination of the trouble we are going through and are much too preoccupied with themselves to worry about (what we believe is) us “humiliating ourselves”. It was as I drove home from my episode, with my head still ringing and my body racked from the influx of enough cortisol, adrenaline and norepinephrine to resuscitate an elephant from a coma, that I thought to myself, “I honestly don’t know how much longer I can take this”. When I got home, I was so physically and mentally drained that I had to go to bed for the rest of the day. I later learned that it takes the body weeks to fully recover from an anxiety attack. But that is just an example of one of the low points that punctuated periods of real high. At times I felt happy and confident and considered stopping seeing my therapist because I was sure I “had got this social anxiety thing beaten”. I was making progress with my therapist by talking and trying to discover and address the root causes of my feelings of shame and low self-worth which underpin all social anxiety. But it wasn’t until I started to take other positive actions (as outlined in my previous post), that I was able to extend the lengths of my waves of confidence and then break free of the cycle of “highs and lows” altogether. If you are still going through the cycle, I know how physically and mentally exhausting it can be. But you should remember that this is a normal part of the battle against this limiting condition. However, it’s not enough to let yourself be passively tossed about on the peaks and troughs of these waves, believing that things will get better over time or by themselves. You have to take responsibility for overcoming social anxiety and take massive action. With a combination of changing your physical world through exercise and positive habits as well as rewiring your inner world through therapy and belief pattern change, there is a way out of the maze. Don’t get disheartened or despondent because of your setbacks and don’t forget to celebrate your victories, no matter how seemingly small or insignificant. And most importantly, keep fighting. ",0

82fqdc,sea," Find Your Purpose to Help Beat SAD. Oftentimes social anxiety can be part of a wider malaise of lack of direction in life, depression, general sense of inertia, and low self-esteem. I found that having clear goals and a sense of purpose is part of the kind of positive lifestyle that can help to overcome social anxiety. ##The Importance of Goals and Purpose## With goals and purpose, we are more invested in our own life, have something to get out of bed for in the morning. We generally feel more confident and positive in ourselves, and are less easily affected by social anxiety relapses and setbacks (which inevitably come). When we are focused on a positive goal or a wider sense of purpose, we also have less room in our mind for the kind of habitual negative rumination which are the fetid breeding ground for social anxiety. Social anxiety often makes us feel helpless and can lead to serious depression. Maxwell Maltz, personal development legend and author of Psycho-Cybernetics said: 'The individual who is actively engaged in a struggle or a in a striving toward an important goal, does not come up with pessimistic philosophies concerning the meaningless or the futility of life'. The popular author and blogger Mark Manson also noted that, if you are busy giving a f*ck about things that really matter to you (like your goals and greater purpose in life) you give much less of a f*ck about other stuff. For social anxiety sufferers, that 'other stuff' usually includes things like the awkward interaction you just had with the cashier in the supermarket. Or the weird goodbye you had with that casual acquaintance you really wished you hadn’t bumped into. The point here being that if you can identify some big goals to work on and strive towards a greater purpose for your life, then it gives a different perspective on life. Negative thought patterns are squeezed out or sidelined by the size of your grand vision for your life. Things that would normal bother us shrink in significance. ##What's Your Ikigai?## No, 'ikigai' is not those rice balls with sea urchin on top. It's basically' a reason to get out of bed in the morning'. A 'reason to enjoy life'. The Japanese say that everyone has an ikigai. And I'm inclined to agree with them. The problem is that when we're struggling with social anxiety and the associated depression, we can often lose site of our ikigai. Or we may not have even had one in the first place. I know when I was in a very bad place with social anxiety I had no goals or purpose. I had no goddam ikigai! It was finding my sense of purpose that helped get me out of my social anxiety pit and that led me to writing this post today. At the centre of the ikigai diagram is where your ikigai and purpose in life lies. Sometimes your ikigai may be unconventional, as it was in my case. And in the case of my brother (he's a dog whisperer in Cambodia!). But it doesn't matter. The main thing is to discover a sense of purpose in life that gives it meaning. You should also not be afraid to 'make your mess your message'. For example, instead of trying to deny my social anxiety I have made it my life’s work and it is what gives my life meaning and purpose. ##Conclusion## I'm a very firm believer in identifying your purpose in life and setting goals around that. It has helped me massively in overcoming social anxiety and turned me from a depressed pessimist into a very positive person with great passion for life. When you do this and are able to do work that you truly love, you can 'tap dance to work' as Warren Buffett describes it. When this happens, there is less room in your life for socially anxious thoughts. So, if you haven’t done so, try the ikigai diagram or any other of the hundreds of articles and Youtube clips on the internet. I'm not saying they will 'cure' your social anxiety, but they may help lay a more positive foundation for your life. These might help you to start living a life of passion and purpose where there is less room for low self-esteem, over-thinking and social anxiety. ",0
9nzd45,runner," This 1 Word Changed My Life. Over the 25 years that I suffered with social anxiety, I developed something I call the ‘No Reflex’. By learning to break it with one simple word, I was able to change my life and help my recovery from social anxiety disorder. &amp;#x200B; # The ‘No Reflex’ &amp;#x200B; I wouldn’t mind wagering that you have a ‘No Reflex’ too. It’s where someone invites you to leaving drinks/a birthday party/a get-together of some kind and your immediate reflex is “No”. More often than not you won’t say this out loud. You go along with it to the person’s face, to be polite…“Yeah, sure. I’m not sure what I’m doing on Saturday, but I’ll definitely try and come”. As you say this, you’re already thinking what excuse you’ll use on the day, when you’ll message them at the last minute to say you can’t go. For me, it wasn’t as if I even fully considered what the invitation was. It was as if there was a circuit in my brain: as soon as I heard anything that sounded like an invitation my mind would shut down. I would already be thinking “NO!”...“Hell no”...“I can ***NOT*** do that”. Then later in life I wondered why I would spend my Friday and Saturday evenings alone, drinking by myself watching YouTube. It turns out, that if you turn down enough invitations, you soon stop getting invited to stuff at all. &amp;#x200B; # Just Say “Yes!” &amp;#x200B; When I was living as an expat in China, there came a point where I couldn’t handle another weekend on my own. I had basically been living as a hermit in my apartment. I was becoming more and more withdrawn and even leaving the apartment was causing me panic attacks and a huge amount of distress. One week a friend-of-a-friend was leaving to go back to the US and, unexpectedly, I was invited to their leaving dinner at a local restaurant. Despite every fibre in my body wanting to say “NO”, I accepted out of sheer desperation and loneliness. As the Saturday night of the dinner party approached, I started concocting all the usual excuses: “Sorry, I’m really not feeling well” ... “Something just came up and I’m not going to able to make it” etc etc… But this time I didn’t back out. Of course, my social anxiety wasn’t going to make it easy on me. My mind started imagining all the possible nightmare scenarios that could occur… I imagined a huge table of impossibly glamorous and beautiful people all sitting around laughing and having fun... Then I walk in. Everything stops. And everyone looks at me in disgust. I have a meltdown in front of everyone and humiliate myself. &amp;#x200B; # It’s Almost Never as Bad as You Imagine &amp;#x200B; When the evening came and I arrived at the restaurant, I thought my worst fears had been realised. I arrived at the restaurant late. When I heard the guests had already gone to a private room and started dinner, I thought about doing a runner. But I rode out my impulse to escape. The waiter showed me to a private room. I was already extremely nervous and sweating. As he opened the door, I saw a room with a huge round table with about 20 people sat around it. My heart doubled it’s pounding. There was some awkward shuffling as it turned out there wasn’t a chair or a spare place for me. I started to cringe and squirm inside. “I’m such a burden” ... “I’ve crashed this party and I’m making life difficult for them”. But this uncomfortable moment passed and I was found a place and a seat. And once I’d hastily downed a couple of drinks and said “Hello” to the one or two people that I knew there, I started to settle down. As the alcohol and conversation started to flow, I found I was actually having a really good time. By the time we finished dinner, everyone was pretty merry. It was then decided that we’d all go to a bar and continue drinking. &amp;#x200B; # One Thing Leads to Another # The upshot was that I pushed myself to go to something and ended up having a really good time. I met a number of new people there, and I started to get invited to get-togethers by them too. I was initially terrified of each thing I was invited to. And (I’m not going to lie) I was still using a fair amount of alcohol to get through them at first. But I was becoming less and less anxious the more I exposed myself to these occasions. The most amazing thing to me was that one dinner party opened up a whole web of connections. I went from drinking by myself in my apartment in front of my laptop every weekend to being plugged into a large network of people. This meant that I was being invited to midweek poker, weekend bowling, leaving drinks, birthday parties. Now I know this might sound like hell to you right now, but I’ll bet there’s also a part of you that wants nothing more than human connection and some social interaction. This is the strange paradox of social anxiety: being terrified of the thing that we want (and actually need) the most. **We often avoid social situations, while sitting shut up in our apartments dying of loneliness and craving human connection.** This can be especially painful and confusing if you’re a socially anxious extrovert like I was. &amp;#x200B; # Something Good Almost Always Comes Out Of It # Now I’m not saying that if you accept an invitation you’ll be opened up to a whole new network of connections as I was. But...one thing I’ve learned from many years of saying “Yes” is that at least one good thing almost *always* comes out of it. It’s so easy for us to rationalise turning down an invitation. It comes so easily to us to make excuses of why we can’t go to something. **The ‘No Reflex’ becomes habitual and ingrained.** But when you break it, say ‘Yes’ and go to an event, something positive and often life-changing happens. Whether it be an art show you wanted to see, a meet-up with a friend, a work conference - it doesn’t matter. In 2017 I went to a conference in San Diego and despite initial reservations, I made two connections there that changed my life. One of them led to trips to Mexico, Spain, Costa Rica, Hong Kong and Thailand with the person I met there who became a close friend. I was 36 years old at the time. Which also goes to show (despite what you may believe right now) it’s always possible to make new connections, regardless of how old you are and how bad your SAD has been. &amp;#x200B; # Conclusion # My message is simple (though not necessarily easy): just say ‘YES!’ Break the ‘No Reflex’. If an opportunity arises to participate in something, GRAB IT! **You will not get better by sitting in your apartment.** Yes, it’s scary and painful at first, but it gets easier as you expose yourself to social situations. Your cognitive distortions and catastropshizing thoughts will fuck with you. Your mind will conjure up all kinds of nightmare scenarios. That’s OK. It’s a normal part of SAD. They are just thoughts. Acknowledge them as the trolls they are and let them move on. Don’t feed them by engaging with them. Because imagination is usually very exaggerated, reality will rarely (if ever) be as bad or good as you imagine. Therefore, catastrophization rarely comes to fruition. And there is almost always a big and potentially life-changing pay off if you do take the risk. And, trust me, the short-term pain of getting out of your comfort zone is far less than the long-term misery of staying isolated and lonely. So, next time an opportunity presents itself, say “YES!”. And even if it doesn’t present itself, create an opportunity by signing up for a meet-up/joining something/inviting someone you know to something you want to do. My experience, and the experience of my coaching clients, tells me it will be worth it. ",0
dhzbqnz,Garden,"I also loved psychedelics but like Ram Dass said, when the trip is over the gate to the Garden of Eden is closed and you are cast out back down to earth.nnThat's why so many of the hippies started to pursue meditation and other practices to try and cultivate those states and unlock their potential naturally. LSD and shrooms don't ""add"" anything to your system, they are the catalyst to unlock things which are in you, but latent and un-accessed in your everyday consciousness.nnIt's great to take trips recreationally, but you gotta treat them as just that - recreation and fun. It's far harder to try and do public speaking or improv, which leads to a real re-wiring of the brain and character.nnTrips give you a glimpse of what's possible, but for me it was always fleeting and i could never ""take it back with me"" into my everyday life. After a couple of days i would have shrunk down from a psychedelic superhero into my normal human self with my normal preoccupations and anxieties.nnI have found real challenges and ""trips"" like public speaking and therapy a way to bring about lasting change.

flv111k,stream," I read a post a while back. It said these things could help you improve speaking... read a book aloud, as if you were reading to another person, instead of silently join an online chat room (like discord) and practice there. if voice chat makes you uncomfortable, start with text chat and then move to voice chat once you are more familiar with the regulars in the server. for 10 minutes every morning, just say your thoughts in an endless stream. doesn’t matter how stupid they sound, just every thought that comes to mind, say it aloud.

dx5ava0,sea," You know what's funny? I am ate up with SA, but I can publicly speak just fine! I don't understand... But you know what I unintentionally do? I keep my eyes slightly out of focus, so the sea of faces is blurred. I look around at people, like you are supposed to when speaking publicly, but I'm not focusing on them. And I'm not crossing my eyes, just letting them out of focus. I think what also helps, is watching public speaking a lot. I watch the pastor speak every Sunday. It's not foreign to me, I'm used to it. After I speak publicly my SA tears me apart, but not during. Because while I'm speaking, im focusing on what I'm saying. I don't have time to thing about my SA. Multitasking is a myth: you can only focus on 1 thing at a time. If you're focused on speaking, you're not worried about anything else. Hope this helps man!

pgmr7a, sand," Does anyone else get scared once people get to close to you?. I don't have a lot of friends (which is a given considering my state), and I have a hard time feeling like people actually view me as a friend (which is harder for me than making said friends), also I am seen as a closed off person and recently I realized something. Once people actually make an effort to befriend me I get kind of scared, like, there's this boy who texts me a lot, not like in a disturbing stoker way, but in an actually reaching out way, actually caring way, sometimes when he text me I get overwhelmed, I feel like he gets to close, I feel like ghosting him (sometimes I do, and then he sand me '???' and it stresses me out even more. Same goes to one of me friends who keeps saying 'that is so us' and acting like we have a special close bond, it makes me want to push him away, or saying things proving to him that he is not special. It's not like I don't like them or enjoy their company, but it stresses me out when they get too close to me, I don't know if it's a coincidence that they are both boys or something, but still, does this happen to anyone else?

bicopq,skate," First Job i want to die. Today i had my first shift at my new job. Im 19 and ive been putting off getting a job for quite a few years but i finally decided to get one at my ice rink (ive been a figure skater there for 7 years) since i thought i would be more comfortable and confident in an environment im familiar with. The problem is my manager was adamant in making me a birthday party host rather than the role i was interested in. I agreed to it because i wanted to get hired and thought maybe it wouldnt be so bad. I was wrong, very very wrong. The whole party i barely said a word, i just stood there awkwardly with a shitty fake smile plastered on my face, save for when i actually had to do something. I didnt realise just how social and entertaining you have to be as a party host. My partner was loud, spontaneous and confident, chatting with the parents and playing with the kids. I felt like absolute shit because i just couldnt do it, even when i tried talking to the kids i was quiet and awkward and had no idea what to say, i was too scared to even help them skate. After the shift i had an emotional breakdown from thinking about the bad impression i must have left on the party guests and my coworkers, as well as just feeling overwhelmed. I want to ask my manager to swap my role but i only just started the job and i dont know if i can use social anxiety as a reason since i havent been diagnosed by a doctor. ",0
g4f3en8,run," Hello! I was a cashier for a couple months at a bagel place and I think while it doesn’t necessarily cure shyness, it helps with putting up a much more outgoing front. Kind of like a fake it till you make it situation almost I think for me. Some customers are super nice and patient and you can have a pretty great exchange. As shy as I am, I enjoyed it! Although the amount of stress I got when I panic and can’t seem to hit the right buttons is also terrifying but I found that the customers aren’t that impatient and you can totally laugh it off. I think cashiering could help you break out of your shell just a little especially with the mindset that your interaction with them is just in that moment. If you’re like me, you may feel socially drained after being really bright and outgoing all day, but a break in the back by myself does the trick in helping me feel better lol. There will also be run ins with some not so nice customers no doubt, but don’t let them bring you down! I think you’ll do great! :) ",0

ljural, stream," I'd rather die than do my internship. I managed to land a 10 week paid summer internship in an engineering company all thanks to me going down the same stream as my dad so I didn't have to take part in interviews etc to get it. Only problem is that I did a two week internship back a few years ago and I spent most of the time hiding from my supervisors. I got away with it because I was only 17 but now I'm 20 and at uni so there's no way I'll get away with doing that now. My social anxiety is even worse now. Honestly, just thinking about all the things I'll have to do like interacting with people, giving presentations etc makes me hyperventilate. I'd rather die than have to go through those things. If I can't even handle an internship, how on earth am I going to be able to work in the future?

8q3qd7,run ," I have to do two presentations in just seven days and feel very panicky, how do I cope?. Hey, I study and they make us do a lot of presentations. I did a 15min group discussion on a brand of my choice with six others on Saturday. We basically pretended to be market researchers and moderate to get the others talking about the brand for that time. When I moderated I was shaking with my legs so much my whole body was shaking too.. as I write this now I do it again. Also I felt my heart race. It’s doing this now again. My hands got sweaty and shaky, I wanted to run away. Another nice symptom showed up: dissociation. I felt as if I wasn’t there and couldn’t consciously comprehend anything of what the others said. Weirdly enough I still managed to ask questions, it happened like an automatic process. Like a robot version of myself took over. Almost had tears in my eyes and when it was over and I got in my car I actually cried for a good 10min. Then shortly felt better, drove home and cried again, still shaking like crazy for about an hour. I then distracted myself. The funny thing is two people told me I looked so calm 😂 people always tell me this when I hold a presentation wtf Sooo the problem is I’ll do a 20min presentation next Saturday. Fuck me what do I do to not be such a mess? And be in control of my emotions instead of them controlling my body? Any tricks? I can’t diagnose myself but this sounds so much like a panic attack to me. How do I calm down from one?

dx88y3p,"golf, outside "," Hi! :\) I have also posted on this sub reddit (and then deleted them out of fear of being judged, go figure), crying in the process. People without social anxiety will never know how isolating and horrible it can be. I feel your pain. My best advice from personal experience, as scary and intimidating as it seems, is to get a job that makes you interact with people. Last summer I became a bartender at a golf course. I was absolutely terrified, and was TOTALLY awkward and shy the first couple of weeks. Slowly but surely the forced social interaction SERIOUSLY made me less self\-conscious, more confident, and better at social interaction. Now, I am a young 20\-something\-year\-old girl serving mostly middle aged men as customers \- this kind of made it easier for me to build my confidence, because let's be honest, it's easy to impress/infatuate middle aged tipsy guys when you're a younger girl. BUT \- even outside of becoming much more confident \(within even just 1 month\) at my job around these older guys, I started becoming much more confident around people my age. I actually went on multiple dates with a few different guys last summer, and I had never been on a date before then! Unfortunately due to school starting back up in the fall and other personal demands I had to stop working. Since stopping, my social anxiety has crept back up \- leading me to face the fact that battling social anxiety is an ongoing uphill battle that you need to routinely fight \(but you can absolutely do it\). Fortunately, I'm starting bartending again this weekend. I'm terrified but also excited at the prospect of getting my social anxiety under control again. Moral of the story \- push yourself, no matter how scary it seems. I know it sounds like such a cliche, and I hate hearing that the way to help/cure your anxiety is to get out of your comfort zone because it seems so fucking daunting and impossible, but please believe me when I tell you IT HELPS/WORKS! And you can do it if I can do it. Trust me. Please please please DM me if you want. I have more to say but just wanted to make this as short as possible :\) ",0
g7tdimc,cabin,"WTF i had to read this twice i thought it was my post, everything u said in your post resonates with me even down to the not feeling able to finish your degree. I finished my law degree a year ago, i got a 2:1. U can finish yours too, I promise you that. I nearly got kicked out in 2nd year when i failed a module because i didnt show for 2 exams (because i went home mentally ill on the uni counsellors advice, but didnt get a referral because i didnt get a doctors letter i needed as proof, but that was because the doctor wouldnt see me but gave me a anti depressants prescription without a diagnosis). I wasnt showing up for class because i wasnt taking in any of it, and i fell behind. This basically happened on all my modules though only this one i got extra fucked on. My assignments were due either every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks, my attendance was poor and when i did attend i basically had no idea what was going on. When lecturers asked me questions i was never able to answer, i cant hear and process long-winded questions at all, then think of an answer, and then say the answer, i jsut cant fucking do it it seems. Same problem for long-winded written exam questions. Im slow at understanding the questions, slow at thinking of an answer, and slow at putting it in words. I have to read questions and sentences over and over to like, process the words and then comprehend there meaning. Its fucked. I've been like this since school, atleast age 15, because i remember having a test for dyslexia back then, i never went back to ask for the results but id assume theyd have contacted me if i did have it (the test was done at school with the school counsellor woman). Back at gcse which is like age 15 and 16, id bury my head in the sand by playing games. It was an escape. Not because i was lazy as my mum still tells me i was now, but i couldnt do the work, i would take ages reading a single page, and none of it was going in and it would seriously infuriate me, i broke stuff because of it, smashed my laptop (which all my revsion was on, so a significant factor in why i did bad at school at 15 probably). People would give me revision techniques and none of them helped, but apparently i was just lazy. So how did I finish my uni degree? Well basically the assignments were written starting about 2 days before hand in. Even though i always had 2 or 3 weeks to do them. I couldnt concentrate until literally the fear of failure forced me to do it and i did i sweating in a state of panick. Fuelled with red bull, and listening to airplane cabin white noise on youtube (it's the only way i can drown out the racing thoughts of my mind, and without the emotional stimualtion of music) and sad to say, post nut clarity. When i get stressed like that i guess the only way to destress and clear the mind is... you get the idea. My last assignment i had to do a moot court (basically a mock court hearing) and i had to take friggin propranolol so i could speak and stop my mind going blank (which always happens to me.) Sooo i do wonder if I have ADHD or ADD, Ive never been to hyper, my brain is always in 7th gear, racing thoughts, but thats not seen in my personality really (apart from when i used to bite everyone when i was like 3) so I'd guess ADD, also wonder about auditory processing disorder. I also dont know if this came first or the anxiety and depression. I feel like i started to hideaway and became more introverted due to not being able to get my work done from the learning issues and as i said games became an escape. Very interesting hearing how similar your story is, let us know how u get on. See i wanted a military engineering career but i couldnt get that with a diagnosis. On the other hand i dont feel like i could do the job because of these problems. I havent seemed to be able to find a fix to this issue in the last few years, no amount of excersize or eating better or drinking water, vitamin tablets, cbd, nothing seems to help. I think i should get a test for ADD, just gotta come to terms with not having the career i want lol",0

d7y23bp,outdoor," I get the same thoughts! I always judge what I might do... I went to a 5 day outdoor music festival by myself and went in probably feeling just like you. Going in I thought, how will I be judged roaming the place solo? What if I don't meet anyone? If you are currently living at home think of this as a step further to gaining independence. Going to places like these alone is huge. You learn about your comfort zone and hopefully how to break it. When I arrived at that festival I literally walked around the entire place just to get a feel for who was here, and where I might fit in. Honestly I didn't really find that comfortable spot. Then I decided, ""fuck it""....Walked into one of the stages (a giant dome) and just danced. This took me out of my comfort zone and set my mood for the rest of the festival. It was awesome! I did end up meeting lot's of people and even though they were only friends for that time that I met them, I still felt very comfortable and confident with my social skills. I gained so much confidence doing this by myself. With all that being said... If things don't go the way you want and you just feel awkward the whole time, try and still learn from it. You did something that you wanted to do and didn’t let yourself tell you otherwise (if that makes sense). If you do go (which I hope you do) a tip that I have is if you feel lonely or uncomfortable because you are alone, force yourself to dance and gradually make your way close to the speakers. You’ll most likely just dance like crazy and end up smiling with the people around you. There is nothing but love at the front of the stage. ",0
d9alt4i,outdoor, This is such a great comment! The only thing I might add is to not bail on your plans because you invited people and they didn't want to come. It took me to go to a week long outdoor festival by myself to realize the importance of such a statement. ,0
dlo5w1d,outdoor," That's like me. I went to an outdoor 5 day festival with a 24 hour main stage last year solo. The stages usually didn't populate more than 10 dancers until about 8:00pm. At that time they would populate to a full dance floor until about 4:00-6:00am. I absolutely loved being there during that 8:00pm - 6:00am time but after that I just felt out of place. I was alone, at an outdoor festival and just don't know what to do. I ended up just chilling in my car (where I slept) and did an occasional walk around the grounds. I did meet 1 person but we didn't really connect. It's primarily a psytrance festival, and it's pretty small as well so I was seeing familiar faces a lot which made it worse. During the night though when it was populated I literally felt like I was on acid or something (while completely sober). I was just dancing and just grooving with everyone in my vicinity. This festival is in 2 weeks and I am still on the fence. I really want to go, but I really don't want to go alone again. I am 50/50 currently. ",0
ku1sxo,rowing ,"How do I get a boyfriend?. Hi, I'm 23 years old and I have never had a boyfriend. Currently, I don't even have friends due to my social anxiety. I've lost my best friend after graduating from high school. She wanted to hang out with me and stay friends but I wanted to stop socialising and hide at home instead. That was around 2015. Then I started studying, I met a few people but there were always only fellow students to me, nothing more. Now due to Covid, I study and work from home and don't see anyone except for my parents and my brother. But the sad thing is, it really doesn't make any difference, it's not like I've been talking to other people before anyways. I can honestly say: Apart from my family, no one fucking knows me. I mean, some people back from my school days or from work or uni may know my name but that's about it. Sometimes, it makes me sad but I know that I've wanted that the whole time. I've basically worked towards that by always fleeing from any possibly social interaction in the past. I've had so many chances but I always ran away from them. Other than the years before, I felt a lot different in 2020. I worked on myself a lot. I started to workout on my rowing machine, I got my driving licence... I am just a lot more motivated in general. And for some reason I started to really long for a partner. I know it's stupid to look for a partner in these times and it's stupid to think that someone like me, who has never had any sort of experience, could simply go and find someone who they feel comfortable around. There are so many aggravating factors but still, sometimes, I just feel like I'm not near as ugly or stupid to deserve this solitude. I'm sick of only having crushes on men but never being able to let things actually happen. I've always had that tendency to develop crushes on older guys. For example, I've had a crush on my driving teacher. I've had my final driving test a couple weeks ago and so I don't see him anymore, but I still dream about him every now and then. He wasn't even particularly good-looking, it was simply for the fact that he had a great, clever sense of humor and he was kind. I didn't want him to think I'm weird or stupid or ugly that I barely talked. Now, the dumb thing is: I KNOW that we could have had great conversations. He always talked about random things and I wanted to talk to him the way I talk with my brother or my parents. I just wanted to be relaxed but I cared too much about his thoughts. So instead, I remained silent and boring... That's why I could probably never have a ""soulmate"": Whenever I would find someone who shares my sense of humor and interests, it would make me tense up and act weird. And so, the other person would never find out that I like them or that I am likeable as well. I feel so trapped... I feel comfortable being in my bubble but I feel lonely at the same time. I wonder why everyone on freaking earth is or has been in a relationship except for me. I feel like an alien. I don't know who I am, I don't know what others see in me... I just wait for this man who can see something special in me, you know, underneath the awkwardness and shyness and everything. Does anyone here have an advice or story that could help me? (Sorry for my English, I'm from Germany :))",0
ihpnvz,breeze," My SAD story. SAD is the most appropriate acronym for social anxiety disorder lol I have been meaning to make this post for a while now. I am an adult now, so its easier to talk about these things as if they happened to someone else. My disorder first flared up when I was in middle school. It manifested itself as a fear of people and judgement, and I absolutely refused to go to school. It must have been really troublesome for my parents, but fortunately they took the right decision to take me to psychiatrists. Unfortunately, none of those people could help me. I was diagnosed with OCD, and given medication (which I did not take at that time). My parents decided that psychiatrists or therapy was a waste of time, and decided to cure it themselves by doling out corporal punishment. I did live with strict asian parents, so this was a natural thing in society. Soon afterwards, my ""condition"" got worse, and I chose to be punished rather than go to school. So that was my routine - wake up, get beat up, stay at home to enjoy my free time. When negotiation and the stick didn't work, I ultimately had to be transferred from one school to another. A new school means new people, therefore my fear of judgement subsided..for a while. I somehow managed to make it past middle school, even though the same problem happened again in the new school. I even got good grades because I was kind of smart(for a middle schooler) and studied. In highschool, things got worse, much worse. This time I got a low grade in my physics exam. Due to being lonely, and always working on math problems in class (the only thing I enjoyed in school), this perception of ""bad with studies"" made me unable to go to school again. I remember those days where I would dress up as if I was going to school, and then return shortly later, overcome with fear. My father turned to alcoholism at this time point, and my mother (dealing with huge amount of stress thanks to my behavior and an absent husband) took out much of her anger on me. And therefore, I coped the only way I knew how - by shutting myself out. From middle school to high school, I had acquired a private room. And if things got worse, I would just shut myself inside. It didn't always work of course - since my parents could break down the door sometimes. Sometimes I had to move the bookshelf. Since my parents did not want me to die, they fed me from time to time. For me, high school was a time of total isolation. I only went out to get food. One day I found a cockroach inside my pants. Cute little thing, trying to keep me company. Things weren't so bad for me though. I had books to keep me company - I would read anything I got my hands on. I had a PC, and eventually internet too. I got into video games, anime, novels. I became a part of online community where I ""felt"" accepted. They were my refuge, but I think they were also things that kept me inside the dark world. Porn eventually came into the picture too. It wasn't easy keeping these luxuries, so I started to fast when they took away my internet privilege. That's how I ruined my body. Eventually, my parents decided that I was no longer fit to go to a proper school, so I became home schooled. This was a wise decision on their part. Thanks to that, I got to slack off from studying everything except maths (the only thing I was good at). My parents hired private tutors who would literally come to teach me and fall asleep on my desk. One of those teachers tried to molest me - he (an old creepy guy) wanted to see my penis. Good thing I refused. Occasionally my mother lost her shit and tried to burn down the house or fight me. Other than that, good times. And so I gave my exams. I expected to get good grades in maths and fail in everything else. What happened was that I failed in maths, and got a passing grade in everything else. LOL. Serves me right for slacking off. And so, there went my dreams of studying math in university. I did submit my answer for a regrade, and they decided to just barely make me pass math. So I was able to enroll in a shitty private college where all the failures went. At this point, something changed in me. May be it was the years of isolation, but I enjoyed class. I devoted myself to learning. I lived in a dorm about 2 hours away from home, and that was a great help since I was finally ""independent"" to a small extent. I experienced some growth. Of course, years of social isolation does not make you a star at getting along with others. So I was bullied in college too (and here I thought they were adults). I guess you could say that I tried to reach the ""Starting line"" that everyone else has already passed. Of course, no relationships, very few friends (huge improvement) - but I spent most of my time in my studies so I never had time for that either. And I goddam enjoyed it. I was nicknamed ""the professor"", and that's where this username comes from. Things got worse again though - and the pattern started to show itself. This happened as I started to question my professors on what they were teaching. Remember that this was a shitty private school that I attended, so the teachers were underqualified. At this point, I had caught up with them, and I learned mostly from online courses and textbooks. This completely destroyed my reputation in college - I was despised by the teachers as being the guy who thinks he's too smart. They would literally scream at me when I pointed out their mistake. At this point, I stopped asking questions and focused on my own studies. I stopped coming to class - not because of my disorder, but because it was a waste of time. The teachers capitalized on it, and did not let me take my practical exams. Thankfully, it was just plain bullying, since they didn't actually want me to fail. Anyway, I passed with an average grade. That was the end of that. &amp;#x200B; Ugh, I think I've typed enough. I go to a great university thanks to part luck and part hard work, I find few friends with whom I can actually connect intellectually and emotionally (sometimes). I am able to graduate with great grades. The problem manifests again, and this time it happens AFTER I finish my masters (I underestimated my own development). \*sigh\*. Stuff(coronavirus) happens, and I get two offers for PhD program - and that's where I am at now. I look forward to being slave #4 at my research institute! Ah , may be this time I can finally experience ""relationship"" and ""dating"" that young people always keep talking about. Or may be I'll fuck it all up and isolate myself again! Whatever the case, I will move forward and find out. I hope you have learned something from my story. Or at least may be it is a comfort to know that someone else is a bigger moron than you are. To those who actually read the entire thing - I apologize for taking so much of your time. I wanted to be honest, once. I don't think I can live with myself, since a lot of time I just end up distracting myself from myself. But I'll do my best. I know my limitations now. The pattern is clear to me, although my ability to deal with it is still a work in progress. I haven't seen a therapist, but I want to do it once I have some money and stability. &amp;#x200B; As I see it, the problem with SAD, and people who suffer trauma and certain mental illness, is a psychological deficiency. They don't know how to live normally. And so, the resources of society are locked to them. Shunned by their peers, and by themselves (especially if they don't understand what they are going through), they fall into an even darker hole. People talk all the time about ""accepting"" people with mental illness, but that actually requires the mentally ill to come out as mentally ill. I would never do that, I fear judgement, why in the world would I tell anyone this stupid story. Accept your limitations for what they are, and move forward knowing that even the passing breeze can make you fall down on your face. Even if you are alone, live life to the fullest. Amor Fati ",0

I read this quote about self-loathing Years back and read it to myself on days like this: “For starters, Rufus found a place where she hated herself less: by the seashore … a wild, rolling, splashing sea. ""The sea expects nothing from me,"" she explains. ""I cannot disappoint the sea. It does not care. It does not hate me, does not love me, does not wonder who I am or what I wear, because it does not care whether I am or am not there. The sea roars, either way."" ",0
cy6qktr,mountain," This also had me overthinking a lot, but I got to the conclussion that they doesn't actually ignore you. I met this year a new girl, which is now one of my best friends, and it was weird because she talked to me, but sometimes she seemed to prefer not to talk to me, or talk to other people. This bothered me for very long until I realised she just didn't make it on purpose, that was the way she was. If you struggle at making new friends, think about how they see you, are you a quiet, boring person? That doesn't sound like someone you want to talk to, right? Try to make a good impression to people (but don't change radically to befriend one person, that's just useless.) And don't think the reason people doesn't want to befriend you is because you are awkward, they just make a bad impression of you, but that's not actually who you are. I say you should just stay with people you think is worth being with, and if you feel people ignores you, analyze the situation and put yourself on his/her shoes. If they are clearly ignoring you, just don't think about it, is not a big deal if you are not part of someone's mind in that precise moment.

dbfhw2p,Grass,"I can tell you firsthand (as someone who is conventionally attractive), that this does nothing for you in terms of the severity of sa. For me, the idea that people who are seen as pretty must be outgoing and confident makes me feel even more worthless and socially inept. Being ""ugly/unattractive"" or being ""pretty/attractive"" does nothing for you. Sure, you might get treated differently by people due to this, but how people interact with me affects my actions in NO WAY. I feel the pressure of society's idea that attractiveness=confidence and easier social skills on the daily. People approach me and expect this bubbly outgoing personality but all that comes out is awkwardness. Then that leads to my family members and friends to ask me ALL THE TIME ""you're gorgeous, act like it! Why aren't you confident? You could get any guy, how come you haven't had a boyfriend yet??"" Social anxiety is about how you perceive the world around you, and is independent of whatever people do. For me at least, it's an endless cycle of self-depreciation and feeling of being judged by others. Grass is always greener on the other side. I sometimes think that if I looked different, at least people wouldn't expect all of these things of me. I'd have an excuse for being the way I am. But I don't. (Not that I am saying ""unattractiveness""=social anxiety, but that is how society usually sees it.)  nnSocial anxiety comes from the mind, your thoughts, not your body. ",0
d9zdze9,riding," Ask yourself if it's helplessness or hopelessness. If it's the latter then it almost certainly sounds like depression to me. Feeling helpless is a precursor to feeling hopeless, however. I won't deny it; hopelessness is a dangerous state to be in (in fact it's the most dangerous). Think about it: by feeling hopeless, you are denying that there will be *any* future, *any* relief, or *any* cure. There's a concept called learned hopelessness. This is caused by repeatedly failing when trying to change the world. The feeling that whatever you do doesn't matter. After being hit again and again by life, you come to believe that bad things just happen to you and there is nothing you can do to prevent them from happening. Once you have arrived in this strange world where your efforts to change or control it don't matter, it is a short step to a sense of hopelessness. After experiencing a long string of failures, it becomes easier and easier to predict your own future. The safest prediction, given your own history, is to predict that you will fail again. Once you begin to predict your own failures, you won't be disappointed because, though you may not be aware of it, you will begin to do things to ensure those failures. I want to make a point about your problems. And that is, they can have more than one outcome. When you were learning to ride a bike, what were you thinking? Probably something like ""There's no hope, I won't ever be able to do this"" as you kept falling down. But then you went a few metres before falling. And then a few more. Before you knew it, you riding around your block. Just because we fall down, should we never try to walk? I have something for you to try. Set yourself a small goal to do tomorrow. It can be anything, like tidying your room for instance. And then do it. And no matter what, no matter how crappy you feel throughout the day, force yourself to remember that you achieved that goal. The next day, set yourself another goal. Then another. Then a few more. This way you'll see that there *is* hope, and that you *do* have some power and control over your life. Before you know it you'll be achieving big things. Good luck. ",0

elhwm6d,breeze," I eventually came to the conclusion that there wasn't really a root, my brain just naturally produces more anxiety chemicals than the average person. I think of it like flood gates. In a normal person, a stressful or unfamiliar situation causes the stress flood gates to open a little bit. Just enough to make them a little nervous. In my brain, they just fucking break wide open at the slightest breeze and force me into absolute panic mode. Acclimating myself to more anxiety producing situations helps to ""teach"" my brain to stop producing as many of those chemicals in those specific situations. And taking medications also helps some. Meditation can also help in the moment. Rationalizing my fears does help some as I discovered that the logical part of my brain is also a bit flawed. I tend to perceive people as being meaner than they really are and to expect the worst when I really should expect the average. If I'm being completely honest though, I think 80% of my anxiety is emotional. ",0

Being selfish isn't even an inherently bad thing - its important to take care of yourself and do what you need to do to make sure your needs and goals are met. Sometimes that will involve putting people lower on your priority list, and inconveniencing them.nnInsecure: A lot of people are. It can be really tough being comfortable with yourself, especially while you're still going through school. That doesn't directly mean that you're flawed, or that you're broken. By the sounds of it, things are unstable at home, and that would cause someone to learn to be more withdrawn and on the defensive. That's you adapting and learning, and trying to keep yourself from getting hurt. Opening up to people and environments takes time. Its risky, and can be stressful and that's ok. You're already making steps to overcome that by sharing here, and that took guts.nnJealous: I'd imagine this would be you looking at people who are successful, or people who are more extroverted and are able to socialize without the same hurdles that you have. It's ok.  Those people, regardless of how well it looks like they're handling things, are also going through rough things of their own. It's just different varying levels of fake-it-till-you-make-it.

She was doing great, and she's really knowledgeable and an expert at what she does. She had to step down from that position a month later.

It sounds like things are difficult to do on your own with the troubles happening from home, and from your anxiety. You need to lean on others to keep that in check, and so you won't have to face social situations on your own. It also gives you a chance to be with someone that seems to not be having the same trouble you are, so its a bit of escapism as well. This is not entirely a bad thing. Better to be dependant and alive, rather than try to cut your connections and possibly end up in a worse condition. Independene is good, and necessary to learn, but learning to reach out to people and opening up to them is also a skill that you'll need to practice over time. Humans are by nature social creatures that rely on each other a lot. People lean on each other, and that's ok.

The thoughts come in vague, like ""you're not good enough"". But because they're vague, they have weak points. They aren't true statements. You can respond back with an answer, so that your mind will start to reaffirm your answer instead of repeating the thought. ""yeah, maybe I'm not good enough for some things, but I'm not worthless. I've made a lot of progress. I've struggled a lot. I'm still alive and still trying, and I'm gonna get to that point where I am good enough. I'm already making progress there.

nz09s1,outside," How To Turn Yourself Into A Social Butterfly. Hello readers! In today’s post, I will talk about my journey from struggling with social anxiety to becoming the person I am today, a social butterfly. A social butterfly is someone who is willing to take social risks and who feels little to no social anxiety in social settings. I wasn’t always a social butterfly. I used to be shy, full of anxiety, and unable to express myself the way I wanted to. This was especially difficult because I was an extrovert in nature. I had a lot of energy and ideas that I wanted to express to my peers and to the world, but my mental barriers stopped me from doing so. I was forced to live the life of an introvert and this made me miserable and depressed. When I was a kid, I was happy, confident, and I had a lot of childhood friends. Everything changed when my family had to move cities abruptly at the start of my first year of high school. This was about 7 years ago. Moving schools and cities was a very difficult process for me. I was leaving behind all the friends I had grown up with, and I did not get a chance to say a proper goodbye and to receive closure. This closure came later, and it will be the subject of a future post. I tell you this story to tell you that my high school years were very tough. I struggled with depression, with acne, with gynecomastia, with OCD, with anxiety, and with other issues. I was out of shape, and despite wanting to be popular and have cool friends, I was lonely and felt rejected. The new friends that I had made were not considered popular and I did not feel comfortable associating myself with them. Things got better in my later years of high school, but it was never the experience I had hoped for. For reference, I am now 21 years old, I am in University, and I have managed to flip my life upside down and become a social butterfly. If you were to meet me and talk to me now you would think I am a natural. It took a long time and it took a lot of me getting outside of my comfort zone and taking risks. It was a painful process and at times I didn’t think it was possible. Below, I will list some of the things that helped me throughout this transformation: **1) Train your “bold” muscle.** Just like we have physical muscles, we also have a social muscle, or as I like to call it, a “bold” muscle. Every time we take a social risk, the muscle grows stronger, and our schema of the world grows. The next time we take that same risk, it is much easier to do so because we have already experienced what it is like to take such a risk. During my tough years of high school, I knew that I struggled with social skills, and I knew that the only way I could become a “natural” was through experience. If you are in a similar situation, understand that at the beginning of your process, being bold and taking risks will feel awkward at times and that sometimes you will think about all of these awkward moments right before going to sleep at night. However, the only way to train your “bold” muscle, is, well, to be bold, to take social risks, and to do the things that you are afraid of. This brings me to my next point. **2) Take baby steps.** You’re not going to start off as the natural guy who is able to talk to everyone in a confident manner. It will take time, and it will take baby steps. I used to try to train my “bold” muscle in the smallest ways possible. For example, in class, I would make it a goal to participate within the first 15 minutes. I didn’t care what I said, or if it even made any sense, I simply had to raise my hand and participate within the first 15 minutes. It was a simple goal. Soon, I was able to participate in class whenever I wanted. Here is another example. I made it a goal to have simple conversations with people, things like saying hi to acquaintances, or asking people how their summer went. At first, I was not able to hold conversations for too long, especially with people who I saw as having more value than me, the people who I considered popular. I could only talk for a maximum of 30 seconds, and then I had to make an excuse to leave. But over time, I was able to train myself to effortlessly have conversations for however long I wanted. I’m at a point now where I can walk up to anyone and be confident and charismatic, and feel zero social anxiety. I am able to lead conversations and understand the nuances of body language and energy. I am able to engage people and make conversations fun and interesting. This all takes time to learn, and the only way to learn it is to practice, one little step at a time. **3) Focus on becoming friends with good people rather than with popular people.** This is something that took me a long time to learn, and it was something I needed to experience to learn. I always knew this instinctively but I had to see it for myself, and maybe you need to go through that process too. I wanted to be popular and I wanted popular friends. Everything changed at University. I became quite social and was able to talk to anyone, and I had some of the fun that I had missed out on in high school. I even became good friends with a few “popular” guys. But after spending time with people, I stopped caring about status. Now, I purely care about how good a person is. I care about true friendship. I care about how honest and respectful someone is, how much I vibe with someone, whether that person truly cares for me, and whether we have similar tastes and hobbies. If your only aim is to be friends with popular people, then you are bound to fail, because your intentions are in the wrong place. This is something that you’re probably going to have to learn from experience, simply reading about it might not be enough. **4) Put yourself in positions to succeed.** Join clubs, join a sports team, maybe even join a frat if you’re in college. The point is, sometimes it’s too difficult to do it all yourself. Sometimes you need the environment handed to you. You need a place where you can practice. You need events to go to. You need people to be around. Sometimes you need the excuse of being a part of something like a team or a club in order to talk to people. **5) Focus on self-improvement in other areas as well.** Try to work on other areas of yourself as well. For example, I started lifting weights in high school. It took me a long time to see progress, but it was worth it. Try to wear well-fitted and nice clothes, they don’t have to be expensive. There are a couple of good subreddits dedicated to male fashion. Get a nice haircut, and groom yourself well. Find a barber that you like. Study at school, read books, be creative and work on projects that you are interested in and passionate about. Working on yourself in one area will make you confident in other areas and will help you on your path to becoming a social butterfly. **Final thoughts.** This post is a message to all the people who are in the same position I used to be in. I know that there are probably people who are in high school or university who are going through a rough time socially. Perhaps some of these people are extroverts in nature just like I am (someone who gains their energy through social interaction), but are forced to isolated lives, unable to properly express themselves because they have too many mental barriers keeping them in a state of scarcity. Perhaps this is you or someone you know. Perhaps you are shy and filled with social anxiety. Perhaps you lack the proper role models. Perhaps you are depressed. Perhaps you want to be cool and popular and someone with many friends, and someone who has no fear and can express their thoughts and energy freely. Perhaps you want to tame your social anxiety and become natural, to be someone who can do what they want when they want in social settings. I’m telling you that it can be done. Practice. Take baby steps. Try little things. Don’t get upset at yourself when you fail. I used to get very upset at myself and tell myself that I hated myself, that I was a loser, and that I was going to be unhappy forever. It’s easy for me to sit here now and say that it won’t always be like that. Try to have some hope. Try to take some social risks. Try to build that “bold” muscle of yours. You’ll become a natural one day and maybe you’ll be able to help others who are struggling. You’re going to go through a lot of ups and downs and a lot of failures. Be kind to yourself. It’s a process. It’s not linear. Progress will be good, then bad, then very bad, and then back to good. It will take time for you to reach a point where there is consistency and stability. Good luck brothers and sisters. Please feel free to comment, ask any questions, or direct message me asking for advice or help :)! ",0

3sy0nb,"river, river","Do any of you guys have moments of clarity, where your social skills (among other things) are boosted tenfold instantly?. Basically, I find that I have moments of clarity that astound me. One such example of that was a couple of months back. Me and a friend were just going places in town, looking for jobs, and we had absolutely 0 luck. My friend started to get really bummed, (because of our luck and other reasons) and I made some inappropriate for the moment joke (which I instantly regretted), and he got even more upset. Now I felt really bad about that joke, and the guilty feeling would not leave my head. We had one more stop to go to, which was a coffee shop, and my friend was thinking that we'll probably have no luck there as well. Suddenly I started thinking about how many opportunities passed me by, how many times I wasted a chance, how many times I messed it up. The guilt for making my friend feel bad got even stronger as well, and suddenly every emotion meshed together and became something you'd see in a motivational speech. My mind was in overdrive, and my thoughts were things like ""oh hell no. It's better to take the chance and go apply for that shop. Fuck being scared, I'm not gonna waste this. I'll never know the outcome until I try. I will do this, for my friend and for myself. We *will* get that job."" Now obviously that wasn't exact. When we finally were nearing our destination, I was fired up due to my motivational thoughts, and when I spoke to my friend it was like I was fucking shakespeare. My mind seemed to have opened the literary gate, allowing a flow of complicated words that I barely remember to be set free in my river of conversation. There were no stutters, no mistakes, and everything I said made sense. My voice also felt more confident and seemed like it was at a higher volume than I normally speak. Every question my friend asked was met with only the most perfect of sentences. Then we walked in the shop and got rejected, but surprisingly (for both of us) we laughed it off due to the manner of rejection and went on our way. So ya. Any of you guys experience something similar? **TL;DR Looking for jobs. Bad joke. Motivation surge. The Dam of Social Ineptness was destroyed. Words flowed out of my mouth like a river, perfectly. Vocabulary skills increased. Social anxiety and anything related was temporarily washed away.**",0

Can't pick my phone out and surf the net, can't really look around, can't get up and move, can't just like that go to toilet (well, you usually can, but you need to deal with many stares). Especially when there are many people around. My muscles become stiff. My heart races. I don't know where to look, so I stare at whatever is in front of me, once in a while barely gazing off to the left or to the right. I am aware of all the sounds that my body makes: stomach grumbling, swallowing saliva. My mind is fighting between zoning off from the boredom and the anxiety. Not to mention when you really don't want to go and, for example, you need to go to the toilet. So you just sit there and wondering if people around you notice that you need to go to the toilet. Well, do they at least notice that you are totally stiff and scared? And... here it comes, the panic mode for the entire length of the meeting/mass/class lecture. Can't go home, can't get out and relax, can't pick your phone out and escape this stress. So you just sit there and suffer. One hour... two hours... sometimes three. By the end of it, you are entirely exhausted. Until next time. :( ",0

98p1zl, stream," My social anxiety story. This is gonna be a loooonng post, so I'm sorry. This is mostly for me, anyway. The bottom line is, I'm just so, so tired of being afraid all the time. Every social interaction I face on a day-to-day basis makes me feel like everyone else in the room is staring at me, silently judging every word I say and every move I make. No matter how tiny and insignificant an interaction is, I still find myself thinking about it, hours or even days later. Whenever I have something to say, I'm too afraid to say it. I can't initiate a conversation, and I DEFINITELY cannot ask people for things. Invisible hands wrap around my throat and choke me out, screaming at me for even trying to trust myself to make my thoughts known. Everything I feel and think is all bottled up in my head, begging to be set free, but my mouth won't make the words. It's been this way for years. As a child, I was totally and completely open about every thought I had. I had ""no filter"", so to speak. I didn't think about how my words and actions would make people feel, or what the consequences would be for doing the things I did. I just needed to get all my thoughts out there. I didn't know how to contain my thoughts to my own head. I didn't learn how to do that until later. Understandably, this caused a lot of problems for me as a child. I was bullied a lot. Like, all the time. All the other kids described me as unbearably annoying, too emotional, loud, immature, and sometimes even downright mean. Nobody liked me, and I knew it. Still, I didn't care too much, and simply brushed it off with the logic that all the other kids were boring assholes. I kept telling myself that, until the last months of middle school when a certain traumatic event in my life (caused entirely by me) forced me to take a step back and really start analysing who I was as a person. I felt like an awful person for what I did, and I thought maybe I deserved every hateful comment, every dirty look, and every instance of social exclusion that I had ever faced over the years. I deserved it all, for all the shit I'd said and done before, and for all the people I'd hurt just by being myself. Before, I didn't give a shit; but then, I realised I hadn't been a good person, and I seriously had to change myself if I wanted to keep any of the few friends I'd actually made. I decided from that day forward that I would think before I spoke. I would no longer just say whatever was on my mind. A good idea, in theory; but I was in a bad place, and thinking about my thoughts just made me start to hate myself. I hated every thought I had. I had learned that I wasn't a good person, and I shouldn't allow myself to say or do anything that seemed even remotely unreasonable or harmful to others in any way. So, instead of speaking my thoughts out loud, I trained myself to think about what I was saying before I actually said it; a skill that comes naturally to most people, but for whatever reason, I never had until later in life. I remember my teachers and parents telling me to ""think before you act"" very often as a child, but it was just too hard. As a kid, I actually made an effort to do just that. As an easily-distracted child with ADHD though, that always lasted about five minutes before I was back to acting like a fucking lunatic. Anyway, that changed. I learned to think about my thoughts, which was both a blessing and a curse. I don't impulsively say things that hurt or annoy people anymore, so that's great. The problem is, now I'm afraid to say anything at all. Remember when I said that I hated every thought I had, and I was constantly holding back from saying something that might hurt someone? Well, I went about that entirely the wrong way. I was bullied for being ""annoying"" and ""immature"", which I guess we're the insults that I took to heart the most, because as soon as I became conscious of my own stream of thought, I started to see myself that way. I figured, why would they call me annoying for the things I say if the things I say aren't annoying? And that's when I cracked the case wide open. I WAS annoying! I was annoying as hell! Every thought I had, I now despised. I became my own worst enemy. I became my own bully; one of the people I'd hated for so long, because they were so horrible to me. And now I thought I finally understand why. It was because I actually was just a shit person. If even I didn't want to be around me, why would anybody else?? I felt that way for years and years. Only now, I've started to like myself a bit more. My thoughts no longer make me feel bad, and I've realized that I am who I am, and everyone else can either take it or leave it. I've grown as a person and become better, and learned how to contain my thoughts to myself, so that I don't hurt or annoy anybody by impulsively saying everything that comes to my mind. However, now I have crippling social anxiety, huzzah! I became so used to not saying anything, so used to just staying quiet and keeping my thoughts to myself, that I pretty much stopped making my thoughts known entirely. I just don't talk much at all anymore, because I'm so scared of becoming everything my bullies told me I was. I can't say what I think, because what if it's annoying? What if it's unnecessary, or even hurtful? I'm so hard on myself now. Nothing I think to say is worth saying, in my eyes. That voice in my head keeps telling me that if I'm open and honest with myself and my feelings, all I'll do is annoy everyone and come off as some kind of freak, and I'll be outcasted again. My thoughts just aren't good enough to share with the world. I'm a fucking weirdo and I'd better just stay quiet, otherwise I'll end up driving everyone away from me. That's how my inner voice has been treating me for the past five years. I'm so afraid to speak. Logically, I know that I'm a better person now, and that the people around me may actually benefit from my thoughts, but....I don't know. I still feel so much anxiety when faced with a social situation of any kind. When people speak to me, my thoughts freeze up, and I can't think of anything to say. Possibly a defense mechanism? As if I'm so afraid of saying something stupid, that my brain just turns itself off? I don't know, but it fucking sucks. I wish I could turn that inner voice off. I wish I could talk to people without freezing up, or feeling so scared of what they'll think. I wish I didn't care so much about how people perceive me, but I do. I care so much. I don't want to be seen as an annoying freak ever again. I'm so afraid of being the biggest loser in the room, like when I was young. But I yearn for human contact so deeply. I feel like all these years, I've been starved of it. I feel so utterly alone all the time. I can't talk to people, though. I'm so awkward. So awkward and so, so anxious. I just want to know what it's like to be myself again. ",0

8uwvjn,sun," Where’d the Time go?. Hi, I feel growing up I missed a lot of opportunities in my childhood. I used to be outgoing (to the point of annoyance) but somewhere in middle school I became introverted and quiet. Even though I had been in school with many of my colleagues for years I feel I drifted away from them and everyone around me. I can’t think of a single friend that I have which is the sort of destructive self-awareness I should try to avoid, I know. Now I’m in college, and just finished my sophomore year. I had hoped going to college in a new state/environment would be good for me and allow for me to open up again to other people. However, since I’ve been here I’ve been even more introverted. My marijuana use has gone up and while it used to help with my anxiety I feel it now provokes it. Everyday I feel trapped in a daze and just kind of going with the flow of my class schedule then just tuning out the world for the rest of the day. The problem is I want to be social, and have memorable experiences in college with lifelong friends. I just don’t see that happening. Any advice or similar experiences would be appreciated :) Sorry to be super personal “The sun is the same in a relative way but you’re older” - Pink Floyd With love, Seil ",0
99pa55," nature, outside "," Tips for going to a house party where you don’t know many people?. Hey there, I hope your day is going great. I’m very socially anxious and get nervous whenever I have to interact with larger groups of people (parties, classes, etc.). I tend to mumble when I talk and am quiet in nature so a lot of the time people don’t remember me being there at events or in class. I just recently got accepted into the course of study at my university I want to start a career in and it’s a very intimate major. There’s maybe 35 students in the whole department itself with 16 of those being in the same grade and starting point as myself. There’s a house party tonight being hosted by one of the upperclassmen and I’m debating if I should go or not. I’m a junior in college and haven’t made too many friends since I’ve been here. I don’t go out often since I’m not 21 yet and most people I know just want to go to the bars. So, house parties are generally the only way I can socialize outside of school. I haven’t been to one in a while and have never really been that great at keeping conversations with people going. It’s usually just small talk for a few minutes followed by awkward silence (although I never mind silence, everyone else seems to be bothered by it. It reminds of that Pulp Fiction quote by Mia Wallace in the car booth at the restaurant.) My question is: what are ways I can keep conversations going, or establish genuine connections with these people? I really want to go but my nerves always win out in the end but this time I don’t want to chicken out of a possible fun time. Thanks for any help :) ",0
jhr6ob,sun," Thinking of suicide. It makes me cry thinking of leaving my sister behind and not staying for her. I’m not going to lull myself but I desperately wish I could in a painless easy way. All of the criticism and judgement upon me for thinking of it or pursuing it or the way I’m trying to survive in this world in a possible way are what lead me to this same urgency or thoughts. I imagine shooting myself in the head when I am cut off again mid sentence by my mom when I have tried to talk to her about everything that’s hurting me about being in this body trapped in this mind...I’ve been told to man up and she purposefully doesn’t listen to everything I wish I could say and now I don’t know how to anyways because of how dysfunctional my mind is..I don’t know how to even express myself anymore..and no point. I have no hope in my life to feel happy about myself and all I want is to learn how to survive without having to suffer more than I already am. But it’s probably not possible and while everyone may think I’m trying to cheat my way out of dealing with life like the rest of the world, I am far from the rest of the world’s capacity to endure it, others are blessed that they don’t have the psychological defects that I have. I may never have a normal life or be a normal person. I’ve already accepted that I’ll never feel beautiful, I’ll never be able to make friends because I’m not like everyone else, I’ve lost everything I had inside of me that I loved, I’ve lost myself physically, I’ve lost myself spiritually, and mentally. I’ve lost everything. People don’t event understand how cruel it is to downplay depression and anxiety and suspect that people are making excuses in life. I’m not strong enough for a damn thing in this life. I just wish I was understood and nobody ever will understand me. I feel like a child trapped in a decaying body and mind. I pretty much am. It’s hard to accept that I’m in a world where I’m subjected to the derogatory and profane treatment of society and others...misunderstood and not seen for the person I am inside...people may think because I’m an adult I deserve or can handle what sucks the life out of me and drains my soul and kills the innocence that I can’t shake from inside of me. I don’t want to leave myself behind to grow up and be as cruel and hardened as everyone else...I will never be able to relate to everyone else my age or desire to. I just want to live for my sister who accepts me as the strange, quiet and broken person I am. No one will ever see what is inside. I just want to die. I’m trying to find my ways out honestly. Trying to see what path I can take to escape as much as possible..but I’m left to face the reality that I have to “suck it up” and I’m “stronger than I think” and I “can do this”. I am not like everyone else who has overcome everything that they have in life and became stronger. My obstacles have made me weaker. Yes I’m sure all anyone can tell me is to see a therapist or get professional help. I don’t have the time or the opportunity. I am crazy for even going on reddit of all options to vent. I guess it’s some form of releasing these thoughts. No matter what no one will understand how extreme what I’m trying and failing to describe inside of myself is. No one will ever understand and the world is unfair. And it hurts that people’s default response to those who feel this way is deal with it because life’s unfair to everyone. Not everyone especially myself is built for it..and in reality no one is built for it I guess. But that just makes me far , far, far less built for it in that case. I feel like I’m suffocating every day with this broken mind and not being able to engage with anyone let alone I don’t want to because I’m not the same as anyone else anyways...and I’m afraid of everyone because of how sensitive I am anyways..and I just don’t belong in this world. And that’s definitely a fact. I was supposed to be asleep a while ago and now it’s 3am and I don’t want to see the sun rise or the light filling up the bedroom forcing me to face the day with the sleep that can barely pull me through the day even if it was nine hours of rest. I don’t think even the most advanced professional in the world could help me. Nothing can help me. I’m supposed to help myself. And I can’t. I just wish I was in heaven and was never born. I hate every single day what I see in the mirror. The frown and the dullness in my skin and my hair. My lifelessness and not even seeing a person in the mirror. I can’t go on and I could go on forever but I need to sleep. I’m stupid for posting this on reddit but that goes to show I actually don’t have the appropriate resources to handle this situation. Embarrassed or not I think it’s perfectly fine considering my sanity is already at the point of suicidal thoughts. I desperately don’t want to live. I desperately wish there WAS a solution and there isn’t. I’ve tried changing for years physically and mentally. I’m only getting worse and I can’t save myself besides looking for routes that can allow me to move forward in a way that allows me to stay alive for my sister without absolutely destroying myself and getting the life pulled further out of me by others who think it’s completely okay to tear someone apart and treat them like their just another broad rather than the pure soul that they are. I’m not calling myself a pure soul in a vain way. It’s actually something that takes courage because it’s frowned upon apparently to be innocent, soft and not like everyone else. This sucks. Horribly. I am so scared of shooting kuself in the head, but more scared of how that is going to effect my precious sister and NOBODY even those who have siblings themselves can understand the measure of love and sensitive I have for my sister...who she is to me and how precious she is..I don’t want her in this horrible world without me and she needs me because her and I are the only ones who understand each other the way we do. I’m scared of bleeding out and I’m scared of my sister knowing that’s the last thing I did was bless to death..that’s not even everything that crosses my mind in regards to that..it’s much more and words don’t do justice let alone I’m too screwed up in the head to know how to word anything. I wish the world was kind to everyone and each other let alone those who are psychologically broken and those who suffer from staying a scared child trapped in an adults body. I hate my life and all I love about my life is my sister. ",0
90be29,"shore, Lake, outside "," How much does environment affect your anxiety?. For the past couple of years I haven't been happy. I've spent numerous hours just thinking and pondering and wondering why I no longer feel enlivened the way I used to, many years ago. I'm 21 years old and I'm at a stage in my life where I'm starting to question the meaning of my existence. I've given it a lot of thought and come to the conclusion that maybe it's the place in which I reside that is the source of my mood swings and anxiety. I was born in Toronto and am a visible minority. For anyone who has knowledge about the city, it's extremely diverse and teeming with all sorts of ethnic cultures. When I was only 2 years old, my parents, who had lived in the city for almost their entire lives, decided to pack up and move to a little industrial city on the south shore of Lake Ontario known as St. Catharines. I have spent the following years there ever since. Toronto is where I feel I belong, and I will elaborate on that below. Most of my extended relatives live in Toronto. My family had work/personal ties to people living there, and for whatever reason it feels like they were happier living there too. I won't get into all the details but I'm mixed race and visibly appear to be of the visible minority side (half white, half visible minority). St. Catharines is a city primarily composed of aging, white, blue collar workers, and there seems to be an air of hopelessness in the city. Several years ago, a lot of the larger auto manufacturing plants here closed down when the whole NAFTA trade agreement came into play, costing people a lot of their jobs. As a result, there are a lot of people here on welfare or barely scraping by, which sort of lends this whole depressing atmosphere to the region. The suicide rate is also one of highest in the country, so I'm apparently not the only one who thinks the whole place is kind of a shit-show. Jobs aren't really a thing here either, well, unless you would like to work retail or customer service call centre type jobs for the rest of your life. There's not much of a future here, a lot of the younger folk straight up move away because of the severe lack of good paying jobs. I had the opportunity to move back to Toronto a few years ago now and refused to take the opportunity for fear of accruing too much student debt. I've been kicking myself ever since, but that now begs the question: How much does environment really affect one's mood? I'm not talking about personal relationships or how many friends one has, although that also plays a part in all this. I'm talking about demographics and small city living vs urban big city habitation. I enjoy the big city; every time I go back it just feels like home, even though I haven't lived there for most of my life. I feel like I'm missing out on all the action when I stay here, instead of experiencing the vibrancy and liveliness of a larger city. Part of it is just the fact that I feel alienated somewhat since I don't fit in with the rest of the population here. People here can be sort of naive, and it doesn't help that the local university has a large international student population that I get lumped into simply because of how I look. It kinda sucks when people don't really think you're a born and bred Canadian. So, with all that being said, I think that while moving back to Toronto may not cure my anxiety entirely, it would certainly help a lot with my fear of people and interactions, and my unwillingness to go outside (and there's not much to do here anyway) with the exception of going to work/school. It may be expensive, but I feel like it would provide a large boost in quality of life, something I so desperately need at this point. I'm young, I should be out there experiencing new things and learning new ideas. I guess I just have to get over this fear of financially digging myself into an inescapable hole. The anonymity of a big city... it's attractive to me. Am I alone in my situation? I'd like to hear your thoughts on the matter. After all, that is why I'm making this post. ",0

I'm 23, I hated high school. I criticized myself, fought with family, and never did what I thought I should be doing. But I don't have regrets now, or think about it often. I found out after high school that many of the popular, loud teenagers I envied were sort of lost. Or pregnant. Or going to college like my friends. Some flunked, some graduated and got normal jobs as normal people. Basically, we grow up and change SO quickly. It's what makes my depression and anxiety- and everyone else's- in high school so sad to me. We have no idea how much things can be different, how much better we understand ourselves, in such a short time. It's only been a few years, but I've moved to different states and experienced a lot. My relationship with my family is great. I still don't have a giant pool of friends I hang out with all the time, but I have a few long term great ones. I realized I like to not have commitments to tons of people, and I like myself enough to enjoy time alone. I'm not perfect, and I have anxiety. I even had a panic attack about a month ago. But nothing seems as doomed as it used to. So much changes! So much interesting and unique stuff is inside you that you don't give yourself credit for. Try not to define yourself based on trying to guess what other people in high school could be thinking about you- you're giving their thoughts more power than your own (and you're making up their thoughts based on your secret insecurities anyway). Be wrapped up in yourself, your happiness, your interests. Ask a question in class randomly, comment on something being funny if you think it is. It doesn't matter if people respond to you or don't. They're people wrapped up in their own thoughts and worries. Learn about being comfortable with *yourself.* And don't sweat it okay? I'm sorry this is long. I'm kinda treating it like a stream-of-consciousness too... only I'm pretending I have the chance to talk to 17 year old me. That's what I'd tell myself. It's totally okay. You're totally fine. Whatever you do, whatever you like, whatever you say... don't worry about it. You are doing you and that's awesome. Figure out how to do more of you. Explore. Try to notice when you're enjoying moments, and remember them :) I wish you the best, man. ",0
rjp4ur, stream," I really just can't talk. How does everyone I know talk so well and with perfect flow? It's like they have a constant stream of stories and responses ready to be used whereas I just listen and give the occasionally ""yeah"". I have nothing to talk about and everything I say comes off feeling awkward and lame. I despise being the boring and quiet one all the time when everyone around me has all these connections and conversations... I want to know how it feels to be so extroverted and carefree and talkative like most of the people I know. I want to be able to talk naturally without having to worry about every single detail of what I say. ",0
e0zdwul,cruise," Hey. I feel the same way about school outings. I freaking HATE them because I don't have any friends in my classes (my few friends do different subjects) and I usually end up awkwardly sitting alone most of the time. But its so so great that you are interested in the topic! That will at least distract (hopefully) a little from the fact that you might not have any friends there. And despite the fact that everyone else is treating it as a social outing, you should just focus on the work and what you are learning. Anyway about being angry at the world. I feel it everyday. It is so unfair that those of us cursed with this crippling anxiety have experiences like this while everyone else just cruises along. The anxiety requires so much of our time and energy and it is fucking exhausting. Sorry I can't give you any advice or reassurance on this. I wish i could, but I feel the same way as you... I need reassurance and advice too. So anyone else out there...? ",0

f2yn8yb," boat, run "," I am in this boat too. I think it's important to get out as much as possible even if it's for small things. I think being a recluse worsens the anxiety. Maybe it would be helpful to pick a ""throw away job"" where you go in with low expectations except to stay for a short duration of time? It could be a place somewhat far away so you only meet people who will be less likely to run in to you again. You can additionally try to create a work persona. Hope that helps at least a little. ",0

fqtim0l,surf," I doubt you TRULY did nothing, did you read a book? Play video games? Netflix? Learn something surfing the web? Etc.. nothing wrong with saying and owning the things you did do. Lots of people are homebodies, and theres nothing wrong with relaxing. We live in a world where people are constantly trying to make their lives look and sound more exciting than they really are. But you dont have to play their game, and people respect you more when you're honest anyways. Also I think part of social anxiety is the dissonance between the life we live and the one we show the world. So doing things to lessen that dissonance and live more authentically definitely cant hurt. ",0
6bzvby,boat," Hope i can help someone [ advice and tips]. Hey guys, im not here to tell you my story, long story short, i'm a 20 year old dude who took his anxiety level down from a 10 to a 3. Ive seen a couple of posts lately of people asking for help, so im going to try best tell you what i did to overcome my social anxiety. I wont go too deep into detail unless someone requests it. 1.) I started to pay attention to my thoughts a kill off the negativity. (Very important) and started replacing them with more positive ones. I had to realise that negative thoughts are never useful. 2.) No more excuses. No more blaming other people. No more playing the victim. I took action to make my life better. ""look at me, im the captain now!"" 3.) I started reading books that were relating to anxiety, confidence and such. (I ripped them off the internet for free) The most helpful books in my case were ""The 4 agreements"", ""psycho-cybernetics"", ""The Shyness and Social anxiety system"" and a couple of others . Reading those books was absolutely helpful. Read!!! 4.) I reduced my porn consumption. Ive actually stopped now, but reducing it down to once a week at most really helped, alot. 5.) I learnt to not take things personally. 6.) self acceptance! Unconditional self acceptance. Learn to forgive yourself, love yourself. 7.) Keep pushing yourself out of your comfort zone. Start small and build up. 8.) I built in a firm belief that all human beings are equal. Some people will be better or worse at doing some things, but we are all still equal. 9.) Belly breathing in stressful moments, I tried my best to not evade these stressful situations. Each time you do this you build up a higher tolerance to stress and anxiety. 10.) Not everyone has to like me, I wasnt put on earth to be liked. Be yourself, do not seek others approval. 11.) Do not fear failure, learn from it. Do not believe you only have one chance, you will always get other opportunities. 12.) Be patient with yourself. "" if you become 1% stronger everyday, you will become 365% stronger by the end of the year"" 13.) You need to become more self aware and learn the root cause of your anxiety. Fix the leak in you boat before pumping out the water. These are some of the thing that helped me the most. Looking back i cant believe how far i have come. I thought this was impossible to me back then. I went from not being able to look my best friend and even family in the eye to having my lunch out with 5 girls on my table (table for 6). I wish all you guys the best of luck, you will beat this. I have nothing but love for you all. Please dont hesitate to ask me anything. Survive-&gt;live-&gt;thrive ",0
dz5yt7a,Go for a run,"All your life you're taught that adults are somehow different than kids. Then you became an adult and you realize you still feel overall the same. You have more obligations, maybe different interests, but you don't feel like the wise and all-powerful ""adult"" that you were taught to be. Why? Because you're still you. You've learned more, you've experienced more, but you're still the same person you were and will always be.nnYour mistake is that you expect something to change (and in only 5 years). There's no light switch that changes from ""off"" to ""on"" once you hit a certain age that triggers some change. nnJust the other week my dad of 65 years of age hurt himself because he thought he could go for a run.

qwuwtb, coast,"Social Anxiety at Work. Hello, I’m quite new to this sub but I came here to ask for help. So I’ve always been shy and bad at social situations. I’m 22 now and just entered the workforce, it’s an office job as a consultant. To preface university was terrible for me as university was all about socializing and my anxiety issues always came and hindered making friends besides 3 or 4 that somehow I managed to make. Now at the office, I’m surrounded by such great people but I’ve had my anxiety issues amplified where I feel like I’m always being watched, I get sweaty, I don’t know what to do with my hands cuz I feel like someone is watching me, I only go to the bathroom when I absolutely need to as I feel like on my way I’m being watched and judged. I even sometimes don’t ever eat my lunch cuz the kitchen is always busy and I keep waiting till it’s clear which never happens so I ended up refusing to eat and have a headache all day as a result. I had breakfast at 7 yesterday and didn’t eat till 9 when I came back home. I use my bathroom break to quickly glance at the kitchen to see if the coast is clear. I know I get the whole get out your comfort zone but is there anything else I can do to get over it. Any advice is welcome. Thanks in advance.",0
df1zvyo,surf," To a degree, I think you're right. I'm someone who actually spent years self-isolating after dropping out of high school. Just stayed home all day, bedroom dwelling, stimulating my intellect by reading and surfing the internet - which can be very resourceful. I finally met with a psychiatrist earlier this year and am on Wellbutrin, which has done wonders for the social skills I already have, productivity, and confidence..so that's a plus. Still, though, there's times where I literally have to force myself out the front door, just to go check the mail. My dad had all of my bills sent to his house, instead, because I'd ""never go get them"". I'm also bad at breaking routines in the first place. I'm 28 at this time of writing, and still have never been in love or a real relationship. My parents never understood my mental illness and even just put me in an apartment when I was 21, and were done with it, criticizing and telling me to ""grow up"" and ""leave the nest"" along the way. I've never really mingled much. Friends like to barhop and socialize, I just sat around drinking a beer and scrolling through my Facebook news feed. Nevertheless, I'm the one who has had to jump over the social hump and eventually put myself out there. It's definitely not easy to find the motivation to do so, especially after you finally make some friends and get burnt by one that you thought was trustworthy. That kind of shit just pushes me back into my comfort zone, and the vicious cycle restarts itself. All I know is, I don't want to waste the rest of my youth being surrounded by the same four walls, and it's never too late to turn your life around. That's what motivates me to go out and try it again. ",0

bpwnne, sand,"My exposure therapy log. Hey guys! I decided to start doing exposure therapy on myself to work on my social anxiety. A little about me. I’ve been suffering with social anxiety for years, and as I’m sure most of you have experienced, I’ve missed out on so much because of it. In the last year I’ve made pretty good progress. I started going to a club on my campus to get out more and I made a few friends there, I’ve also been reconnecting with old friends from high school and hanging out with them too. I’m still not where I wanna be though and my social anxiety still gets to me in many situations. Because of that I’ve decided to do 20 days of rejection/shame therapy. The basic idea is that you do something weird or embarrassing in public to desensitize yourself to those feelings. It also helps you put things into perspective as people’s reactions are usually not as severe as we imagine they’ll be. I wanted to put my experience on Reddit to help encourage others who struggle with social anxiety and want to try exposure therapy. Day 1: Ask three strangers for a piece of gum. I went to a grocery store kinda far from where I live to do this. My first person was this little old lady. I was so so nervous, I almost didn’t go up to her. It’s so funny thinking about how scared I was of a sweet old grandma. I managed to walk up to her though and asked her if she had a piece of gum. She let out a little laugh and said sorry I don’t. It didn’t last more than ten seconds but it was so powerful, I really had nothing to be afraid of. The second person was a middle aged woman. I went up to her sand asked the same thing. She said sorry no and gave me a little weird look. That one was way easier, only about a quarter of the anxiety. Last one was a middle aged guy who was talking on the phone. I got his attention and ask for a piece of gum, he told the person on the phone to hold on and asked me to repeat what I’d said. I asked him again and he said sorry but he doesn’t have any gum. He almost looked like he was genuinely sad he couldn’t give me any. So that’s day one down. The difficulty of the challenges will go up as I go on but today’s challenge was a great way to start.",0
anzxi7,stream," Birthdays remind me how behind I am. I’m gonna apologize ahead of time for the poor writing and sounding too whiny for my age. I’m turning 20(f) this weekend. I haven’t had a friend since I was 13. I don’t know how to communicate with people in a way that can lead to a friendship. Even if I can get comfortable talking with someone, I never act like my true self and I put an act on. Then I feel tired from having to pretend I have that type of personality. I’m terrified of people knowing how I truly act in fear that they’ll reject me (duh). Also, the relateable (here) never had romantic relationships and what not. I’ve never even held hands with someone I liked. I’ve been asked out a few times a year, but I just about always get a creepy vibe (in the sense of someone who only goes for weird hermits, like myself). I always say no. Their looks were nice but I just (honestly) didn’t like their personalities very much (and I don’t think looking past someone’s personality for their looks or for the fact they asked me out is a good thing for me). I think I have been on one date with a guy that was nice, but I wasn’t really aware of it because I can’t read people whatsoever. I wasn’t attracted to them. I thought they were just trying to be friends... but now I get it (oops). Recently I met a guy that was super easy to talk to. But he’s in a relationship so I’m not gonna mess with that. Still gonna try and be his friend though since I never meet people I can’t talk to like that. (I can turn off my “like” level at the drop of a hat, so don’t worry about that). Not gonna lie I was a bit disappointed though. I’ve managed to shove my anxiety out of the way enough to be in school, talk to professors to get in a lab, and I’m working on internship stuff (that requires communication so that sucks). But I can’t deal with it well enough to where I can even put myself in situations to meet people to either make friends or find a date. When I go to class, I avoid looking at anyone and I assume that’s a good 95% of the of the reason no one sitting by me ever talks to me (even during class discussions). But I can’t seem to find a way to start a conversation with them or seem open to one, as it just makes me uncomfortable. I’m afraid I’ll never make a friend. I’m afraid I’ll never have a relationship. And I’m simply embarrassed that I’ve never kissed anyone before. If the opproutinity ever presents itself, I’m afraid I will shy away from it because I will obviously be bad. I know most of this stuff is stupid to worry about it but I can’t be the only one, right? I don’t think anxiety will ruin with my career, but it will ruin my ability to make actual connections with people (and that is what worries me the most). And I kinda want kids? Idk, I’m off and on with that one. The older I get, the weirder I’ll feel about not reaching certain life “milestones(?)”. This is a mess. I’m sorry about that. It was just a thought stream and I’m on mobile. I’ll fix it up if it’s terrible whenever I get on my computer. I’m just embarrassed to even post this. ",0

He was nice, funny etc. Because of some things going on my life I’m *really* looking for some male company. And I found him extremely attractive. Honestly I wanted to find a makeout buddy tonight but that didn’t happen. Anyway. He was making an obscene amount eye contact with me, talking directly to me more so then others, would look up at me whenever I was laughing, and over the night I started trying to break the touch barrier (arm, back, knee etc) and it seemed like he was reciprocating (a small amount), getting closer then needed when talking, letting his arm brush against mine etc Later I wrapped him and my other female friend in a side hug while we were standing and talking at the bar and he didn’t seem uncomfortable at all. And finally when we left I hugged him “nice to meet you” etc, and he seemed more than fine it. However there was no explicit traditional flirting happening, or sexual innuendo or anything. So my questions are: do you think he was just enjoying the attention, or actually flirting? And, do you think I missed the boat? Missed his signals? Like I could have done more? I just feel like I thought tonight could have ended up differently and more satisfying then it did. ",0
fb8j9l,"outside , sun, outside , running"," Looking for help.. I've always thought of reddit as the place you go when you're looking for feedback from a group of people familiar with your field, I'm not sure how factual that is or if I'm inadvertently posting my problems to people who don't care or aren't interested. I'm just struggling in my current situation and I'm looking for help, and this just seems like a good way to get unfiltered input. Sorry if this isn't what I'm supposed to be posting or seems rude in anyway, I'm ignorant and desperate. I've been struggling with social anxiety and depression for my entire life, and I've been seeking medical help for the past 5 years (I’m 21 now). I can’t function properly because of this, my subconscious just tears me apart in most situations. Nothing in particular triggers this, I’m just constantly uncomfortable outside of my room. I lose jobs because customers get aggressive and I start crying, I can’t use the bathroom when my roommate is home so I have to wait until the next day for them to leave, I’m completely incapable of making friends or forming relationships. It’s just hell, I don’t know how else to put it. I can’t support myself or pursue things I’m passionate about, and I’ve been trying so hard and in every way I can for years to fix this. Talking to people is just a constant mental battle of “don’t give them a reason to hate you”, I’m saying and doing whatever I can to make that person like me more. All the while I’m sweating everywhere, my arms are shaking and my legs feel like jelly, and I’m too busy overthinking things to form coherent thoughts and struggle to speak without stuttering. Afterwards I’m full of regret and upset at myself for whatever minute thing I might have done to offend them, or how poorly I performed doing a very basic human task of having a conversation. I’m very self aware of this and it makes trying to continue pursuing these social interactions so discouraging. My doctors have diagnosed me with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and social anxiety, and I’ve been prescribed every medication under the sun including controlled substances, none have lessened the effects. I’ve seen and stopped seeing 5-6 therapists now and all therapy seems to do is ruin whatever day my appointment is on. I've tried most common coping skills and practice some myself to help maintain functionality in stressful environments, but the collapse is inevitable. I’ve only been able to successfully cope with weed and self harm; weed is illegal in my state and while I have my own thoughts on self harm I’d like to stop it in time. My main concern is not being able to support myself, people have suggested that I sign up for disability, which I guess is what I’m doing now. I hate the idea of someone sending me money because I “cry too much”, just makes me feel shitty knowing there’s people out there that would kill for my life. I’ve worked in IT, retail, fast food and sales and every one of them have ended with me crying in front of a customer and asked to leave or just stressing too much about the work to step foot in the door again after a bad day. In the past few months I’ve been trying to find ways to make money from home like selling game goods or freelance audio/video editing on Fiverr but this isn't nearly sufficient enough. I’m in school for NetSec and I’m hoping to land a job I can work from home in the future, but I don’t have a lot of confidence in things turning out ok. It’s so discouraging to push for so long and see no improvement, and all I can do is rinse and repeat. Now we get to chapter 2, the depression. I don’t want to get too much into it because you can likely fill in the blanks and there’s no sense complaining about it, but the gist of it is “If I can’t support myself or make friends or do anything outside of sitting in my room and crying, what do I do with my life?” This is constantly running through my mind, just hating myself because I can’t get basic things done in life and being disappointed at the results. I don’t know what to do or try at this point, as I stated currently I’m signing up for disability but I’m not confident my request will be granted. I’m researching electroconvulsive therapy because… I don’t know what else to do, and I’m going to start asking my doctors for controlled substances. I obviously don’t want to get addicted to anything or see long term health issues, but like I said weed has helped so sedation = good I guess. Any and all input is helpful and greatly appreciated. Thank you. ",0
hgl13m,waterfall," I need to be prescribed benzodiazepines, but I'm afraid I'll abuse them.. As far as substances go I've only done marijuana and alcohol. When I buy weed I buy an ounce a week (about $250) and I'm constantly smoking anytime I'm physically able to. There diminishing returns on account of tolerance, but it provides me relief and I abuse it. When I but alcohol I never buy beer, I go straight for hard liquor and I drink until I can't stand and throw up. Everyone in my family is an alcoholic, EVERYONE. I lost my uncle to alcohol a few years back, and I remember being at that funeral and thinking I should never let this happen to me. I'm just in a constant state of anxiousness around people, including roommates. I live in a repressed way to ensure I'm as small of a burden as I can be. Any sense of relief I can find, I abuse.

a450jn,bay," How would I even go about getting help.. I really have been enjoying reading things in this community. Sorry for the long post. Anyway I am 22 years old living at home. I have had this for as long as I can remember. As a kid I was always told it was shyness and I would grow out of it. I waited forever and it never did. Perhaps it didnt because I was the #1 target to bully in school. (Middle/high) principles and teachers bullied me to death. I have stated in different post on how my mom deals with general anxiety and somewhat understands but my dad has been complete opposite. He thinks I should be out working. I am in college (business administration because idk what else), online only of course, it allows me to do work and not hear what teachers think of it. Originally my dad promised to not harass me for a job until after college. That changed fast. I dont guess it's necessary to talk about my jobs but you can skip this if you want to. I have maybe got a year worth of work in altogether. Walmart xmas seasonal, started as a cashier and practically begged to be a buggy pusher instead. Little did I know this didnt stop interaction. Customers talk to you just as much. I just quit on a day I couldn't take anymore. Food lion night shift. You would think that being after hours this would work well. No I am like a perfectionist and I am slow and of course I couldnt take whatever my coworkers thought of me as I was even slower then newer people. So I left abruptly too. Forced into another job at i went to lowes hardware third shift stocking. Little did I know they would train you to work lifts and all. They absolutely scared me. They put me on the ground stocking after I hadn't finished putting up stock on 5 aisles. On the floor I got even more criticism so I left. Flipping on Ebay. At thrift stores my mom always has to pay as I can't comprehend a conversation with the cashiers. I never respond to anyone on ebay and this isnt going well enough for my father as it isnt secure. Not to mention how I am screwed tax time as I only made enough to get by some loan bills and some food. I know my father hasn't said it but I just know he wants to kick me out. I have had full on breakdowns when he criticizes me face to face and now he goes straight to my mom who I try to walk on eggshells around as i dont want to screw up the only person I can talk to without tons of studders or fears. I'm here because idk what to do. My mom usually handles all the appointments. Like if I go to the doctor she still goes back and does the talking for me. I dont know what to do. I need to get this fixed. I need to make money so I'm not on the streets and people may not think bad about me. To be honest I dont know if I will respond or even read the messages. But I am going to try. I need to do this. ",0
nlyptc, hill,"how to get over social anxiety. I've struggled to deal with this issue my entire life and I've finally hit a wall and want to change and get rid of my social anxiety. I am a 24 year old male and have struggled with a decent amount of social anxiety my entire life. Going back to when I was younger and in school (middle school and high school is when this started for me), I always felt nervous/awkward and out of place. Never approached women and always dealt with fear of being rejected etc. Never have had self confidence. Always kept to myself and kept my group of friends small. I never usually reach out to people first, I wait for people to reach out to me. Even when people reach out to me, I have issues opening social media messages due to SA. I get extremely anxious before going out/going to an event due to the fear of conversing with people (when I go out it's impossible to talk to someone new and I completely freeze up and lock up). I have bad self talk/self image due to my SA. I feel like I can't be myself even around my parents or family due to the amount of SA that I'm dealing with. Deep down I know and believe that I'm an interesting, charming, charismatic guy who could befriend anyone and make anyone laugh and have a good time. But my crippling SA has completely destroyed me. I am curious what those who struggle with SA as much as I do, do to get over their SA and better their lives? I want to change extremely bad but I feel like this is such a huge hill to climb and I just feel like I've hit a wall and am completely drained...",0

czvon87,trees,"I am getting better myself at having less fear about the situations. However, I have not dominated the whole 'initiating' conversations aspect. usually the places where I am able to talk, the act of talking/chatting is sort of ""set up"", like in a club or some sort of social gathering. However this is usually where you will talk with someone anyways. You probably won't chat with some person walking opposite you at the mall or on the street.nnWhat I believe you and I should do (or maybe just me), theoretically, and what makes the most logical sense, is to just put ourselves out there and fail. get up, fall down again, get up again. Like anything, social skills take practice to gain. You can't get practice without experience and you can't gain a skill without both.nIt sucks, and it will hurt (if you are me), but it gets better. nnI think you overthink the way I do, which is that we try and make sure to think really well about what we want to say so that the conversation is perfect and there are no random pauses or awkward silences. Or, maybe that's totally not what your problem is. I know for me, I focus too much and actually DO very little.nnI'm sorry that I didn't give real clear cut advice but I hope you will from others.

emfa4zx,"bleachers, bleachers","In 3rd grade ( I was 7 now 23) my teacher was known as the ""creative"" teacher. She had us write stories based on pictures we drew, present the pictures to class, and read the story out loud. At the time I really liked the idea of being a writer/artist when I grew up, I had read more books and taken more Accelerated Reader tests than literally every other person in my entire grade at school, and I had my brother teach me how to draw, I was really going all in. At the end of the year she would give an award to whoever she thought had the best drawings, stories, and presentations in front of the entire school. I was so excited and really felt like it was going to be me, I put my all in every drawing and story I made. When award day came around and it was time to announce who got the award, I was so eager I stood up prematurely and started walking down the stairs of the bleachers, but then she called out someone elses name and all the teachers at the end of the bleachers told me I needed to go back to my seat. I felt incredibly exposed, like everyone was looking at me like I was an idiot, on top of feeling like a failure because I thought I was going to get the award but didn't, and now EVERYONE knew it. I sat down and started crying, not because I didn't get the award, but because I felt like an Idiot. Im not sure if it was triggered by this situation specifically, but after that I always found it hard to read out loud in class, I stopped drawing and reading for fun all together, and never really tried to get an award or earn any kind of special recognition in school ever again and slowly became extremely reserved and quiet.",0

I know 1 but that's because of my brother. When we're hanging out I really don't say much, he just uses me for all the music on my phone. Instead or getting to know anyone I pay attention other things. My building is across from the one with the most kids, so it's really easy to see if people's lights are on or off. I try to figure out what cars they have and where they park them. There's a pool in the middle of both buildings, so, whenever someone's swimming I have an urge to watch. Not for the whole time they're there, but just a minute or two. I also try to collect information on them. My sister knows most people around here so I just ask her about them. Also, I live on the ground floor and most of these guys live in the penthouses, lol, maybe theres a message there. Something else I do with the friends I have for some reason is, instead of talking to them (I text 1 or 2 a few times a month because my selective mutism prevents me from talking to them at school, the only place I see them) I remember almost everything they say on twitter or whatever. My timeline is always full of ask.fm stuff that I never forget. Remembering the cars thing also applies to these people lol I don't know why I do this.

8q4n1h,sun," Social anxiety sucks but it's not the end of the world.. Long. A little background here... I'm a 20 year old male with pretty severe anxiety and a very mild form of autism known as PDD. Having PDD means essentially that mentally you're always going to be a few years behind. Mentally I feel like I'm 14 or 15, but at least I'm mature enough now to recognize that. Maturity wise i've always been 4 or 5 years younger, so hopefully as I get older I'll eventually start acting my age. So this disorder first really became a problem in middle school, after going through a traumatic event. I was popular in elementary school (everyone thought I was funny), but I became socially withdrawn. I was put on heavy doses of experimental medication though, which, while cured my social anxiety and depression, turned me into a psychotic, narcassistic, fat freak who had no emotion and didn't give a shit about anything but me. I eventually (over the course of years), got off of everything because the meds were killing me physically and psychologically. This is when my social anxiety returned with a vengeance, and became unbearable. In 10th grade I transferred to a small private school for troubled teens after moving out of an **autism** school I had been in for 2 years (the meds pretty much made me lose control over my behavior completely, public wasn't an option anymore). I was so scared of people that I couldn't make eye contact, could barely speak up at all. When I did, I always embarassed myself. I'm sure people thought I was slow or something. I ended up getting convinced that the only way to control my anxiety was through illegal drug use. Yes, my plan was to smoke weed and abuse Xanax among other things so I didn't embarass myself everywhere I went. And, yeah, I got involved in some pretty heavy drug use. It did cure my social anxiety, though, for the most part (Heavy Xanax and alcohol intake, that is). I ended up making some friends (most I'm still close with), keep a job and excel at it, and I even (sort of) lost my virginity.... But the excessive drug use was a nightmare. My doses kept going up and up, and every time I tried to taper I'd just become a psycho. They were hitting the danger zone; I was seriously afraid stopping them would kill me. I was up to an equivalent of 50mg Xanax daily, an absurd amount. Since withdrawals off this shit can be deadly and because I was a junkie I felt like stopping wasn't an option. I ended up being so depressed I woke up every day wishing I was dead. I became an obnoxious, cruel narcissist. Never accepted blame for anything. Bitched constantly. Manipulated people. I was just out of touch. And I was dopesick all the time too. Always in pain. When I had sex for the first time I could barely get it up even though I loved the girl (I still do), which was embarassing and painful. Things ended horribly with her, and I've got nobody but myself to blame for that. Even most of my friends couldn't stand to be near me and those who could were also really out of touch. Parents were saying literally every day that they were going to kick me out, and they were searching my room every day and finding shit. Even though I worked 40 hours a week, pretty much every penny I made went to drugs, alcohol and cigarettes. It was awful; I turned into a junkie and an asshole nobody wanted to be around. One night, a week or so after me and my ex cut things off, I took an unusually high amount of benzos and drank about a bottle of vodka when I was out with friends. I barely remember coming home that night. Woke up in a cell. They said I assaulted my stepdad and attacked cops who showed up after. The guy was sick of my shit, rightfully so I see now, and wanted to bust me. Damn did I get busted. I ended up spending 77 days in what was essentially prison (a step up from the county jail, where real inmates go), had to detox cold-turkey. It was brutal and lasted a month, but I'm alive. I was convicted of 5 misdemeanors in jail and I now have to wear an alcohol monitoring bracelet (which I've worn since April). I have a felony (assault on officer) pending, but if I don't break the lengthy conditions of my probation for another 60 days, I'll only get 3 more misdeamors (huzahh). Things are fucking tough right now. My social anxiety is back with a vengeance, and, again, everyone thinks I'm autistic as fuck. Hell, I even started writing this in the first place because someone at work today said I was ""slow"", because the intense stress I have to deal with makes it very hard to focus on work and process info. Work is torture because the last thing I want to do right now is communicate with anyone and doing that all day makes me extremely, extremely uncomfortable. Interacting with strangers and coworkers aside, I even feel like I lost the ability to relate to anyone, including close friends. It fucking sucks. Things are getting better, slowly, however. I was put on 50mg Zoloft a month ago and I have to say I'm surprised at just how effective this is. I'm able to get out of bed, I don't dwell on things as much, talking to people isn't *totally* impossible, and I'm finally seeing the obvious error in my ways and trying to make amends with anyone I've hurt. My apologized to my mom, who understood, thank god, and told me something I won't forget: ""When you're so caught up in how awful *you* feel, it's understandable that it's hard to see things from another person's perspective."" I'm making amends with my stepdad, who I used to think was Satan incarnate. I see now he isn't such a bad guy as long as you're not breaking every law under the sun in his house. Even made up with my ex, who said she'd ""be there for me, forever and always"". I really don't deserve people this understanding. A friend of mine who used to not be able to stand me because of my bitching ended up hanging out with me a few times and had a lot of fun. I remember him saying, ""Are you cutting the bitching out just because I'm around?"" People really aren't so bad, I've found; I can't understand why I'm still so terrified of them. But things are getting better slowly. I actually think that, if I just keep working hard, saving up money, focusing on sobreity, et cetera, I have a bright future ahead of me. Because I'm not dumb and because people in much worse situations than me have made it out alive by giving it their all. Every time I'm at work, and I'm tired, and people are making fun of me, and I'm so uncomfortable I'm studdering, I just keep thinking about my ex, how she, for example, worked 60 hours a week just to stay alive on her own at 18 to escape from an abusive household. I could be in a much, much worse situation and I'm a wuss if I continue to just blame everything on my anxiety and other people, and never take the steps myself to improve my life. A quote from my absolute favorite show, a legit masterpiece and a work of art, *Neon Genesis Evangelion*, is something I live by day to day; ""As long as the sun, the moon, and the stars exist, you will always have a *chance* to be happy. After all, you are **alive**, make the most of it."" Anyone who actually read this, thank you so much. This is really my life story more than anything and if I'm being totally honest I wrote this as a form of therapy. I went overboard, but if my story reaches someone, somewhere and helps someone out in some way, shape or form, I'm glad. We're all in this together, we're never alone in our struggles. tldr: It may seem like rock bottom now, and daily life may be a very real struggle. But there is *always* a *chance* at happiness as long as you are alive no matter how hopeless it all may seem. tldr 2: zoloft induced rant tbh ",0

It used to be fun and I thought it would help me overcome my anxiety but the people I work with irritate me and the kids are just too much. They're 4 and 5 years old. I feel more comfortable when I'm running the class by myself and no one else is in the classroom. The kids still don't really listen to me. I'm the funny teacher who is just like the kids to them. They don't take me seriously. And then I have staff who try to override my authority. Like if I'm disciplining a kid, Ms. S, who also works in the classroom will be like ""you can just do this."" I let a couple kids stand on chairs so they can see our class sea turtle. And Ms. S says to the kids, ""we're not supposed to be standing on chairs, are we?"" The worst thing is, I don't know how to defend myself. So even though I get so ticked off by the way I'm treated, I won't say anything. And I'm afraid to be myself when other teachers our present. But when I'm be myself, I can be myself. I feel like all the teachers think of me as inadequate, and sorta stupid. My common sense is a little off. But I still feel like I should be treated the right way despite my lack of common sense. And all the staff get along so well while I'm just left out.

448kq1,runner," This is for those who are hiding at home, unwilling to face the world. I was borderline agoraphobic for 4 years. Yesterday I went out and got a job!. I've been borderline agoraphobic for 4 years now. After I graduated High School I stayed home and kind of dropped off the face of the Earth. So what changed to make me get out in the world? I could go into the whole entire story. The story about how my dad has supported me financially through these hard years. How this year he turned 63 and his high stress medical job has taken a toll on him and he may have to go on disability. But basically, life happened. I realized my dad is sick and that my seeming inability to function was not an option anymore. All these years I've done absolutely everything in my power to avoid living. To avoid failure. For the past week I've popped an Ativan and a beta blocker, pulled myself up, and gone into an interview knowing that I might make a fool of myself. And the amazing/infuriating thing is that I didn't fail. I didn't make a fool of myself. I did it and now I have a job that I NEVER thought would be possible a year ago. I'm TERRIFIED! I have no restaurant experience and I got a job as a food runner at a highly respected/high volume restaurant. I have as many responsibilities as a waiter and will be constantly interacting with people. I just see myself a year ago and how incredibly hopeless I was. Of course I'm not cured. But I've made progress and that's honestly not something I can say I've really done in years. Heres what I've learned: 1) Don't sell yourself short. You have more power than you know. SA is an illness and it clouds your thoughts. 2) This is the hardest one. Be willing to fail. Once I opened myself to failure I found that I had more strength than I realized. Once I gave myself the option to just fuck everything up I more often than not did better than expected. If I can just give hope to one person who feels totally stuck than I'll be happy tonight. ",0
q2ka74,"riding ,  waves"," Venting. I'm trying to quit my job and it's proving difficult. Feel free to share success stories. Or thoughts.. I'm a 23 year old guy. I've been struggling with my job since it started 4 years ago. It's probably not the cause of the worst of my problems but has made them worse. I've been going to a psychologist since before then, which is one hell of an expensive hobby. But she's gotten me through it, and I'm a week away from putting in notice of resignation. Someone else at the business is also 'leaving', they put their notice in already, they were clear they wanted to leave. But since then they've had a 'meeting' with the boss and whilst they say they are getting what they want, the result is the exact opposite of what they said they wanted. It sounds like they're no longer going. No benefits though. I'm at a point where if I go, things have the potential to grind to a halt, due to a lot of the things I do being things that everyone else has pushed away as they don't want to do them. which also happens to be a contributing reason for me to leave. This has happened for so long, that they no longer know how to do them and won't take my hints to at least learn or try. They have been manipulative in the past. Intentionally or not. I don't know. I'm just at 'wits end' and am having far too many breakdowns, they're making me feel horrendously guilty. They were putting my co-worker down so much when all the co-worker wanted to do was to escape and get a better life and follow their dreams. The conversations when I have brought up problems have been received like 'oh yeah I see, we shall look into this', they've written things down officially signed them off as having been addressed, and then nothing changes and I can't say anything about them again. I'm sick of being used, I'm sick of being belittled, I'm sick of doing overtime to do the bare minimum only for it to be rejected as necessary (and then not even appreciated or paid), I'm sick of having to take up the slack whilst feeling so unwanted, I'm sick of breaking down whilst trying to say why I'm struggling so much, I'm sick of avoiding problems because I know I can't put up an argument. I feel trapped, useless, and inadequate. I have all these people around me in life and the one I can talk to costs me a day's pay for an hour. The job was supposed to be a breakthrough for me in life. To gain experience, to become better with people, and all it's done is given me names that I never want to hear again. I was supposed to learn things, I've only learned of new ways to feel like crap. I feel like I've lost all the passion in life, I've lost all the joy I had in playing games, getting exercise, even in eating. I know I have to make it to the end. I'm just struggling, and I have no one to talk to or cry with. I usually make the difficult choices/conversations by just initiating them and then riding the waves that follow. I'm bad enough normally with the anxiety but, it's too much. TLDR: Struggling to quit a job that's detrimental to my mentals because I can't handle conversations without crying as a twenty flipping three year old male. Also why isn't there a venting flair? A lot of posts are venting style? ",0

6eekal,mountain," Changing accent because of anxiety. I'm Spanish, so I'm talking about Spanish accents in Spain, and I have no problem speaking English, because I've learned (I'm still improving it) the standard American accent, and I'm very confident about it. I read and I talk the same way. And I feel good about losing my Spanish accent in English. The problem comes in Spanish, I don't know how much you know about Spain, but as any country we have different accents, and as happens in America, the Andalusian accent has a bad reputation, we don't pronounce all the words. Kind of the difference between American accent and British R.P accent, the Brits pronounce less letters, as the ""r"". The thing is because of my anxiety I fought my accent, I felt embarrassed talking Spanish, so I blamed the accent (same as I blamed my teeth, my body language, everything xD) I stopped talking in public with accent, I had a weird mix talking face to face. But reading I would lose the accent and talk as a guy from Madrid. And I don't know what to do anymore, should I talk as a guy from Madrid or should I keep my accent? I mean even reading and everything, I don't see Americans reading in British way, that's because you're not ashamed of the way you speak. And let me tell you the difference about losing my Spanish accent in English and why is it different, the thing is that the Andalusian accent is a native accent, but the Spanish accent isn't a native English accent. I heard people saying to me that I shouldn't even lose my Spanish accent talking English, I can tell you, first handed, that anyone who says that knows nothing about language. There are communication problems when you speak English with a Spanish accent, so that's why I'd recommend any Spanish speaker to lose it. But would I recommend to a guy with a Southern accent (as Matthew Mcconaughey) losing theirs? No, because any English speaker should know how to understand a Texan accent. What do you think I should do in Spanish? I heard Americans saying that they didn't know how to speak properly, for example, they changed from saying ""thang"" to ""thing"" with a pure ""ee"" vowel. Would you change your accent if you were from Texas? Have you changed your accent? And the most important thing is this due to social anxiety? When I said reading with accent I mean, for example, the way Americans say ""mountain"" or ""clinton"" you don't pronounce the ""t"", and (if you're not an asshole) you won't doubt of saying those words like that slowly, and even reading it. I think you're ashamed of your accent when you say words in a certain way speaking fast, yet reading or doing it formally you change it. For example I do think that the black accent need to be polished ",0
t0wlip, stream," It looks like I am giving up because of my social anxiety again. The words of my ex-friend “You are a coward. You always run away from conflict instead of facing it. Stop doing that shit.” Yet, here I am going to do it again. I am a 23F. I have 107 followers on my Twitch account, that wasn’t intentional. After posting on Reddit about me starting a live stream despite my social anxiety and meeting a new friend, people asked for my username. I didn't like to leave questions unanswered so I was gullible enough to say then post my username on my profile so people won't continue to ask. I wasn't expecting many people to follow me. I was hoping to build a following naturally by people knowing and liking what I say or do but having multiple people follow me without knowing who I am, not seeing my content, or hearing me. It’s anxiety increasing. The reason why I started the stream was to practice talking without feeling embarrassed in front of one or two strangers. Now I have an audience and feel the tension to entertain. The thought of them regretting their decision to follow me after knowing me. This is very stressful. The longer I avoid live streaming because of my anxiety, the more I think about deleting my account and disappearing. I do make irrational decisions when afraid and stressed. I don't want it to come to that, I don't like disappointing others. My social anxiety is that bad, I can't voice call or live stream without being dead silent or very awkward. I would need another person to keep talking for me to talk more. I never had a voice of my own. People put words in my mouth, saying what I want, think, or feel since I was younger.

4xhaqi, sea," Paxil reviews. I'm considering taking paxil for the last 2 weeks now. I have no problem talking with people one on one, but when I'm in a group or party I feel like I might as well be lost at sea. I'm an 18 year old guy and my demons get the best of me. I start second guessing myself with what I say/said and feel like people are judging me. If anyone on here has taken paxil, can you please write a review of your experience. I want the good and bad. I've heard about the weight gain, tiredness, and sexual problems (getting/keeping erection and delayed/no orgasm). The point in taking this medication is to be more open and fun and have more relationships. If it slows down my sex drive I feel like it's contradicting my reasons for going on the medication. Any help is appreciated. ",0

Basically for my whole life I’ve avoided conversation, eye contact, etc. I go in places and pretend no one else exists and I also can’t bring myself to care about any conversation ever. I was fully prepared to live my life that way forever. I’m 23 and just got into my first relationship and my bf talks to EVERYONE, makes jokes, and has long conversation with every cashier. It’s starting to take a toll on me because I feel like a stupid tree log that is inadequate. I just stand there silently and wanting to run out at 100 mph lol.

czu5my3,"backyard, mountain","Thanks for the response. &gt;the image you make of someone in your head is pretty much your imagination only. That's 100% the case for me, I'm realizing now. I guess I really did just overreact to the whole situation. I have a tendency to take things to extremes in my head, like if some random girl smiles at me I can't stop thinking about it for the rest of the day and I get this huge confidence boost where I suddenly feel more attractive, but if someone criticizes me or points out something wrong with the way I do things, it ruins my whole day and I can't stop thinking about it for a week. So when this started (and when it ended) it seems like I just blew it way, way out of proportion. &gt;I don't know what you wrote, but depending on the level of despair and spite in your final message, she might have been turned off. My experience with women is pretty much on par with yours, but from what I've been told they hate desperateness. This is what I'm still confused about though. I'll admit, looking back, I did come off as desperate in my messages (probably because I am), however she did as well, and that was our main topic of discussion. But my final message before she stopped responding wasn't even desperate at all, it was just a casual comment in a back-and-forth dialogue we were having. It just seemed like a strange place for her to stop talking, like if someone literally just turned and walked away in the middle of a face-to-face conversation. Either way though, sending that followup text likely didn't help and only made me seem more desperate and probably clingy. &gt;But take a step back and look at how things have been going. Yes, this chick that seemed really awesome might be gone, but you have matched with a girl that you consider cute, which is already an impressive feat in itself, and then managed to talk to her for quite a bit and get her number. I would reckon that makes some great progress . That is a good point, and it sort of does make me feel better, but at the same time all I can think about is the fact that I finally DID manage to find one other person a lot like me, actually so similar to me it's sort of frightening, AND this person happens to be a girl I found attractive, AND I managed to hold a conversation with her for a while--but I still wasn't good enough for them, and they left. If I couldn't even hold on to a person like this, how is there any possibility I'll be able to find someone to be with in the future? I just can't see it happening. It's like someone dreams of climbing Mount Everest but has severe, crippling acrophobia, then one day they climb a 6' ladder in their backyard as practice. The moment they stand up on the top step, they panic, lose their balance, and fall down. If this person can't even successfully climb 6 feet off the ground, how in the hell could they ever climb a 30,000 foot mountain?",0
d2n662s,"outside , mountain"," Basically I'd describe SSRIs as making everything ""easier"" by decreasing how much you care about things. Let's say normally you give 90% too much of a fuck about social situations, then on SSRIs (or Zoloft, at least) it makes you give about 50% less of a fuck about everything. Tasks that used to be extremely demanding, both physically and mentally, due to anxiety, suddenly felt trivial, like they simply weren't big deals. They felt easy. I was in college when I started meds, and back then one of my biggest fears (one of many) was about eating in public places by myself; too anxious to sit alone in a crowded dining hall surrounded by groups of friends for fear of being judged or secretly made fun of, or just looking pathetic, I would often try to avoid getting food until the busiest hours were over. Eventually I figured a system out and would go get dinner at 8pm, half an hour before they closed, when it was practically empty and the only people left were other loners like myself, or people who had night classes, or nerds who were studying while eating. If not that, I would just get in, get food, get out, and go eat in my room. There were several nights in my first month at college where I waited too long to leave my dorm because I couldn't bring myself to face the outside world, and the cafeteria ended up closing, and I spent the night hungry and feeling ashamed for being too weak to take care of myself. Just one of several nerve-wracking scenarios I had to deal with everyday for my first semester, until I decided to go on medication. Started taking Zoloft on my first day back in January. There were some physical side effects at first, mainly upset stomach, then lethargy and extreme tiredness, then feeling apathetic and zombie-like, then after 3 weeks I started to notice the positives. The apathy never went away--and it was what made the drug work. It just made me not care about stuff anymore. I stopped caring about what people were thinking of me when I walked by, what people thought of how I was dressed or how my hair looked, what people thought when I was acting awkward, what people thought when they saw me eating alone, what people thought in general, and about life in general. Everything was just ""meh"" to me and nothing really fazed me, so the physical symptoms associated with anxiety also stopped. No more nervous sweating, no heart racing, no trembling, no knots in my stomach. I spent the remaining semester in a sort of zen-like daze (or is it haze? I don't know), in this false trance-like state where I was no longer an anxious person. Let me repeat: it made me not care about stuff anymore. This included academics. After a disastrous first semester where I failed two classes and just barely passed a third, I was determined to turn things around and get my act together. Then the SSRIs kicked in, pretty quickly actually, and I said fuck that. I started routinely skipping class whenever I didn't feel like going and just stopped doing homework overall (think Peter Gibbons in Office Space). I was more relaxed than ever and had more mental clarity than ever because the drugs cleared the fog away and let me see the world for what it objectively was, unobscured by the anxiety that once plagued my head, and I could clearly see what I cared about and what I didn't. Apparently I didn't care about grades or my academic future because I basically set myself up for failure right from the start--the first week of classes was the ONLY week that whole semester where I attended all of my classes. The following week, I didn't attend a single one. I just sort of realized I didn't care, I didn't care if I failed or not, I didn't care what my professors thought, I didn't care what my family thought, I didn't care what anyone thought of me anymore. Those were the most honest four months of my life. After returning home for the summer, and after my parents discovered that I had failed another 3 classes, I decided I didn't care about college at all and spontaneously opted to drop out and go out on my own to try and find work. I spent the rest of that year on SSRIs, and it was a great year, actually the best year of my life, and the only year I can look back on fondly. At the end of it, though, I decided I didn't want to use meds as a crutch anymore; I was finally feeling good about life, and about myself, and I figured I'd rather learn to cope with the world on my own, without drugs to guide me through it, so I stopped taking them. SSRIs had helped me climb most of the mountain, and I was determined to get to the top myself, without anyone else's help. This is the happy ending version of the story. The real ending, though, the sad one, is that I progressively got worse an worse over the next year as the fog rolled back into my head. The anxiety slowly crept back up on me, and continues to do so, along with depression, my old friend. Now I'm sort of back on meds, except these meds are actually alcohol, and I hate myself all the time. **TL;DR SSRIs can make everything easier, thereby freeing you up to lead a more fulfilling life** ",0
d624ef7,mountain," The simplest way I can describe it is if your anxiety is normally at 90%, SSRIs bring it down to 40%. The fog gradually clears as the meds enter your system and you just sort of stop caring about everything, which paves the way for unhindered, unbiased decision making; simple, mundane tasks that would normally be nerve-wracking suddenly seem easy and trivial. It's like a tremendous weight has been lifted off of your shoulders--you're still carrying some of it, but most of it is being carried by the SSRIs now. Everything is lighter and simpler. I was on Sertraline for a year but I ultimately decided to go off it because I wanted to try combating SA on my own; at the time, I was in a place where I felt confident enough in myself to continue on without meds, because my life had been turned around and I was actually happy; it was like the meds helped me get partway up the mountain, and now I was strong enough and brave enough to climb the rest of it alone. Unfortunately, over the next few weeks, as the drugs left my system, I felt the weight of anxiety slowly return and place itself on my shoulders again, getting heavier and heavier and heavier until it was unbearable and morphed into 24/7 depression, neurosis, and self-hatred. This is where I am now and this is why I'm considering talking to a doctor again for round 2 of SSRIs. ",0

Most end up dying in loneliness and confusion, never knowing the love of an owner. And thank you for calling the cops about the animal fights. That is disgusting and morbid. So are his children also related through blood to your sister? Or just step children? Sorry, maybe I just misread. Either way they're motivation for him to stay in your house. Your parents will always say this is your last chance or make threats, but most likely, they'll never follow through in fear of seeing their daughter and grandchildren possibly homeless. My friend sadly had a friend who used her kids as a sick advantage to cruise through life. She used my friend a lot - for money, housing, babysitting and just to bail out of parenting - and my friend was too invested in the kids life to let them go. She completely understood she was being use - everyone told her - and probably like your parents, she just couldn't handle the idea of the kids being in an unstable situation. It broke our friendship. I just wanted her to live her own life but she didn't know how to at that point. I think your sister has a lot of self - esteem and security issues that won't handle when she was young. Honestly, with you mentioning she was a 'bad@#&amp; wannabe', it's obvious she was trying to hide her true identity with another one and this guy helped her with it. I don't doubt he did the same thing he did with your family upon first meeting her - giving her gifts and hiding his true colors - and she was easily swayed by the first guy who said he loved her. It's sadly the reality of those who have self - esteem issues. And now, she's so deep into this relationship, she can't see the dysfunction of it because it's become so common. I also wonder it comes from fear of being alone...? I strongly recommend you discuss with your other siblings how they feel and then talk with your parents. Everyone should be comfortable and safe in their house and it sounds like his behavior makes it possibly hostile (drinking, arguing). Maybe you guys - if possible - could have a sit down with your sister and discuss these things and his treatment. Someone needs to help her get her self - worth back and your parents need to get their house back. If all us fails, I recommend you saving your own money and moving out as soon as possible. Perhaps look into roommates? Do you have any relatives or grandparents close to you who wouldn't mind you staying with them? I'm so sorry you're dealing with this.

eqsn7p, breeze," Let's share advice with each other.. I haven't seen a lot of posts that are about helping each other out, so I thought I might share some of my tips/techniques that have helped me in the past! Keep in mind that while some of these are pretty simple, they do require repetition to fully master them. **Mindfulness** * basically a skill that makes you aware of your surroundings and is supposed to calm you * when you're feeling anxious, stop what you're doing (if you can) and notice your surroundings * ""i'm feeling anxious"" ""i'm sitting in a chair"" ""i can feel the breeze on my skin"" ""i hear car horns"" * try not to judge your feelings, just acknowledge them **Positive thinking** * it's scientifically proven that if you are optimistic about a situation, you'll perform better; if you expect to fail, then why bother trying? * try to tell yourself that everything will be fine and no matter what happens, you're going to do your best * even if it does go poorly, focus on what DID go well and reflect those victories 1. Having a handy dandy list of conversation starters * might just be me, but one of my problems is I never know what to say on the spot * in case you share this problem too, here's a small list of things to say: * ""Do you have any pets? How old are they?"" * ""What did you do/are you going to do over the weekend? I did/am going to..."" * ""When's your birthday?"" * ""Do you have a job? Do you like it or do you wish you could be something else?"" * ""What TV shows do you like?"" **Baby steps** * If you want to control your anxiety, start small. If you're like me and your family orders meals for you at restaurants, start by telling the waiter what you want to drink. Let someone else tell the waiter your food order. Congrats! You just ordered a drink for yourself! Awesome! * If you want to try therapy, bring along someone you trust and knows about your anxiety. For the first few sessions, let that someone explain your situation to the therapist and you just focus on growing comfortable with the therapist. There's no pressure to talk and you could try talking with a notepad. The therapist (should) respect your boundaries and eventually the real therapy will begin. I hope this was helpful! Good luck with the fight, comrades! ",0
i537mi,running," Words that hurts.. Today at work, a coworker said something to me that still stings in my heart, a few hours after it. I have been working in a necropsy lab for the past few months as a summer job. I really liked it. I learned a lot, people were nice to me, etc. Today was very busy, I was running everywhere trying to help everyone and be useful. As I was working on an animal, my colleague said something in the line of:"" You're quiet but you work really well!"" I answered ""thank you"" and laughed it off. I was happy for the recognition but my mood rapidly sank when he added: ""Did you make a vow of silence?"" I could have heard my heart crack in a thousand pieces. I know it was a joke. I know it wasn't mean. I know I AM very quiet. But I can't help it. I've been socially awkward my whole life. I don't like talking. I'm not good at it, and I know it. But I make efforts. I look at other people, I try to copy them, to learn the art of small talk. I try to picture myself from the point of view of other people to understand WHY I'm weird and what I can do to change it. So much so that sometimes I think; hey, I'm almost normal. And then I hear a comment like this one. And I feel like there's no place for me in this world. No matter how hard I try to talk and be normal, it is not enough. Remarks like the one I recieved today will stay with me forever as little scars. I know it, and it's what makes me sad. My colleague did not want to be mean, I know it. The only guilty person is me, for being this vulnerable and having this huge insecurity. No, I didn't make a vow of silence. But I am making this one: next time somebody says something like that to me, I will be prepared. I won't be caught offguard like today or like all the days in the previous years that people have told me I'm ""quiet"". I will say, while looking at them straight in the eyes: "" It's just my personality. I'm like that. I've never been a talkative person."" And I will wait for their answer as I keep staring right into their eyes. I will not be ashamed of being myself. And my mantra will be: "" I am aloud to exist in this world.""

iiurwl,"run, walk","My story, if anyone wants to read it. I'm a 21 years old female and I'm a new reddit user, also English is not my first language so please excuse any grammatical errors. When I was about 15 I started to struggle with BDD (body dysmorphic disorder), I was sexually assaulted about a year later by a friend when I was passed out drunk, under the covers in front of his friends. I've previously had suicidal thoughts but luckily never acted on them. When I was 18 I got raped in a toilet stall at a nightclub and I think it was about two and a half years since my social anxiety started to kick in. Probably as a result of previous events. It all started when I was at work and my name was called at an assembly with every co worker. My eyes became staring and I felt this hotness run through my entire body. It was like I disconnected and couldn't even answer the question and everyone was looking at me like I was crazy. I guess some people thought I was upset about something and came up to me later to ask how I was doing, but that incident seems to be the time when I went from just being a bit shy to it becoming something else. After that I started to really avoid these assemblies, I took my lunch break when I knew they were going to be held or just pretended like I was too busy to come if that wasn't possible. Slowly but surely eye contact became incredibly difficult for me. I could be at work when a customer would come up and ask for my help and I would get that weird disconnection where my eyes were staring and I noticed that the customer would react to it and start to get really uncomfortable. I hardly even know how to describe that feeling when my eyes do that. But I imagine it's what happens when you actually are in some sort of danger and your pupils dilate for better vision. This became a regular thing for me and really screwed up my life. I've since learned some ways that makes eye contact easier by like touching my face, scratching my hair or drinking water. It's also easier when I'm the one talking instead of listening or when I have to look downwards instead of upwards, for example if somebody is taller or shorter than me. It's also easier if its a kid or an older person I'm talking to. Walking into a room where people are sitting is my nightmare and just going shopping for food has become one of the hardest tasks I can think of. Eventually I had to stop working at the store because it caused me so much anxiety to always be on my guard and never to feel relaxed. I've drifted away from my friends and family because I struggle with answering the phone or even texts, and if I can skip hanging out with people I do so. It feels like I've forgotten how to behave like a ""normal"" person. Every time I meet someone I'm so hooked up on just thinking about the way I sit or stand and where my eyes go that nothing feels natural to me anymore, except for when I'm alone. I got my first facial twitching a few days ago when I forced myself to go see a family members baby. Of course they asked if I would hold the baby and I really didn't want to but felt obliged. I held the baby and every person in the room was looking at me and I felt the anxiety coming like a wave washing over me, my hands were shaking and my heart was pounding like they normally would when I'm anxious but then my face started shaking like crazy. It was mortifying and, like I usually do, I kind of disconnected from the world, no matter how hard I tried I couldn't stop the twitches and it felt like the situation never ended. Everyone got kind of awkward because of me and of course that triggered me even more. I don't really have anyone to talk to about this so I thought I would shoot my shot and see if there's someone here who wants to read this long ass post and maybe just chat. I feel like I'm drowning in my lonesomeness even though I'm not really alone, just alone with this I guess. I don't know if anyone will even bother reading this but I guess I feel a little bit better just getting this out of my system.",0
ij4o7e,outside,"I HAVE BEEN WEARING A MASK LONG BEFORE COVID. I’ve had social anxiety since I was about 16.. I’m now 23. To the outside world, I make myself appear as a happy, sociable, and relatable person. Always smiling, speaking with a friendly tone of voice, acting as interested as possible in everything anyone says and responding with what I think will make me seem like a chilled out guy. Little do people know, this is all rehearsed, an act. I am constantly having to mask my inner depression  and anxiety so I don’t bring other people down or kill the vibes. It’s exhausting. I have perfected the art of appearing extroverted to strangers and acquaintances. I even managed to hold down a sales job for 6 months, making cold calls, having meetings with strangers etc but this ultimately lead to a breakdown and I quit. My family and a few close friends know of my mental struggles, but to most, I try and be as “normal” as possible. I try and avoid social situations, hate phone calls/public speaking, cancel dates last minute, stress over interactions I’ve had, and cringe at almost anything I have said to another human and how it might’ve made me look. Before any social interaction I’m so nervous that I cant eat and sometimes vomit, and I tend to drink excessively when socialising to numb the anxiety. Despite this, all my social interactions seem to go well but I feel like I’m not being my authentic self. (As my authentic self is a stressed out, paranoid, anxious over thinker who analyses everything way too much) Therefore, I struggle to make new friends, build and maintain a relationships with women, and spend a lot of time alone in my own thoughts. I forced myself on a tinder date for the first time in 2 years yesterday and even though she thought it went well, I was uncomfortable the whole time. I find it so hard to connect with new people as I’m just constantly in my own head. I have started to address these issues with therapy, which seems to help a bit, but I have a feeling that I am going to be wearing a mask my whole life. It’s an exhausting experience and not the life I had imagined for myself when I was younger. If anyone can relate to this, or have any tips on how to bridge the gap between my true self and who I present to the outside world, I would love to hear your advice, opinions or experiences. It’s nice to know you are not alone in these feelings. (Sorry for the long essay rant lol)",0
ikd1pg,"park, walk","I (21M) am now in a friend group in college but I fear I'm too quiet for them.. The title mostly says it. The Saturday before my sophomore semester began, my college had a screening of the first Jurassic Park film and I went on my own because of course, I would. I had some brief convos with some familiar classmates from the previous classes that I had during my freshman year and that's where all my social interactions ended. I even sat by myself during the film whereas most people sat with fellow classmates. I was fine with it but thought it would be nice to have some friends to enjoy the film with. When Jurassic Park was over, I walked over back to my ride to get back home. On the way, a couple of girls shouted, ""Hey, you!"" to me. I turned around and saw them walking towards me. Let's call them by the first letters of their first names (A and J). They actually took note of how I was sitting by myself and that I needed some new friends in my college life. A asked for my Instagram, I asked for J's Instagram and we became a friend group after I threw my Twin brother into it as well. The girls seemed to want to be close to us as they asked us to do so many activities with them from a hip hop dance demo class (my brother and I were the only guys there) to a trivia night (Of which we actually won). After the trivia night, A decided to lunge into me for a long hug where we even swayed for a bit. Unfortunately, that night is going to be really hard to top. And my brother and I have been pretty quiet and shy around them. They still act really friendly around us and find whatever reason they can to take a selfie of all four of us in the same photo. However, due to me not offering enough to the table as I feel I should, I fear that I'm losing them and losing the deepness of this friendship. The last time I saw J, she still wanted to hang out with us (A wasn't present on campus), but I got the vibes that we were losing her. It appears to me that while J still very much wants to be friends, she seems to be at her best when A is around. It's like when I was younger, I was so insecure that I was in no established friend groups, and now that I am, I feel like I have work to do to maintain these friendships even though I still very much enjoy their company. Sorry for the long post. If you have questions, feel free to ask.",0

iy3t0s,outside,"Sudden Onset and Hindsight. Mostly just talking here but also welcome the thoughts of whoever can relate somehow. I don’t know if anyone remembers a distinct beginning to their anxiety; the funny thing is I do: I was a straight A honor student. Then in eighth grade I sat at the breakfast table, doing my homework - and all of a sudden I wondered, why bother. Why finish this assignment, and why keep trying to make friends or be happy. So I just stopped- well, I couldn’t continue. It was seriously that sudden- I had energy and in a second I didn’t. It never returned; I mostly flunked eighth grade to sophomore year, because none of it seemed to matter. For so long I wondered: What caused that change? Yet honestly? Looking back now it’s obvious. I was extroverted but had no friends because everyone thought I was a jerk. We also moved constantly. My family didn’t help things by telling me to focus on academics - but I had no social rewards to reap as a result of doing that, apart from a distant chance at wealth. My parents wanted me to stay a kid, and to be ‘theirs,’ free from the poisonous influence of outsiders. They pretty much encouraged me to be a dick, telling me all other kids were assholes and I was better than them. So I treated others like shit while craving their promised acceptance. I was socially feral, not happy, and no one gave me a choice or permission to be happy or socialize, outside flinging insults and telling me my inherent ‘superiority’ would someday win and I would be justified. But as ‘smart’ as everyone told me I was? I couldn’t see or understand that those stresses were probably the reason I shut down, until -decades- later. I blamed myself for the ‘eighth grade moment’ and got confused; or I blamed nothing, and got angry. But it continued; from that moment I stopped being able to verbalize, or socialize with others outright- alongside a number of other depression and anxiety related issues. I wish I could go back in time, back to when I still had the energy I had before eighth grade (which I never got back- and I’m 35 now.) I wish I could tell myself: figure out what makes you happy, while you can. Don’t just try to be what your parents want- And don’t listen to them when they tell you how much better you are than everyone. Listen to people; share joy with them, and stop doing things that make you miserable just because you’re told. Maybe then I would have avoided the trigger event- what was always a possibility from my chemistry/genes, but I could perhaps have staved off by being better taken care of when I was too young to know better. Or - maybe it was inevitable anyway and I wouldn’t listen. But 22 years later I feel the lost chance. I sought therapy/medical help and it never worked. No friends, no desire to make them despite longing for the idea. I had a few ‘good’ years but they were brief and ended very poorly, long ago. No family, no kids- Ugh.",0

So my birthday is coming up on Friday and I’m planning on hanging out with a friend of mine (19f) on Saturday, since she’s staying on campus for school and Friday may not work. We’re probably going to hang out at my place for awhile that afternoon (which we’ve done before). I mentioned to her that she’s welcome to hang out for as long as she wants to that day, like if she wants to go to dinner with my family and I, and even watch a movie at my house (which we’ve talked about doing before) or go for a walk that night. If that’s the case and she’s able to hang out late, then I can take her back to campus that night or even the next morning if she’s comfortable spending the night (campus is like 40 minutes away). We both like to stay up late so I figured why not mention that we can hang out later if she’s okay with it. I personally don’t see anything wrong with that but I just want to ask you all’s opinions about it before I mention it to her (that she’s welcome to stay the night if she wants to). Like would that sound weird if I said that? She’s been totally okay with things before that I wasn’t sure how they’d come off (because I’m a guy and she’s a girl), so I don’t think she’d have a problem with me offering that, but I just want to make sure... My other friends think it’s totally fine but my parents are worried it might freak her out, (when it’s really nothing different than what I’d ask my guy friends about doing). I’ll be seeing them on the Friday though. So basically is it weird if I mentioned to her that she’s welcome to stay the night if she’s comfortable with it?

j2bob3,run,"Accidentally dented a car. My (20F) car is small so I didn’t think it would be a problem and I was going really slowly, but I got about 3/4 of the way into the spot when I heard a pop and realized I had dented the car next to me... I immediately panicked but I had to keep trying to park the car properly so I spent a good 5 minutes trying to get the car out again without making another dent. The dent popped back out. I finally backed out of the space enough to maneuver my car back in (but backwards) but this woman immediately came up to my car and started yelling at me all angrily which made me freak out even more. She wasn’t even the car owner. I had to force myself to calm down and not cry as I tried to park again in the same spot (no other spaces were open) and she kept yelling at me. And then ANOTHER random old lady started telling me I hit that car like I wasn’t clearly in the middle of backing into the parking space (to avoid the same predicament). I decided to just wait for the car owner to come out because I’ve never done this before and I wanted to ask the other car’s owner how this kind of situation works, and as I did so, the angry woman came back a few minutes later and started taking pictures of me and my car, saying that it was her friend’s car. She then went away again and came back in her car, stopping to take pictures of me and my car and the other car AGAIN as if she hadn’t just gotten it the first time. I was CLEARLY sitting there waiting for the car owner for a while. If I had planned to drive away, I would’ve done it way earlier, no?? The car owner was taking too long so I had to go inside a local store to borrow a pen and leave a note. I got a call later and the car owner was so much nicer  and perfectly polite about the whole thing. I’ve already paid for the repair and figured the whole thing out. Not once did she get angry with me, she just wanted the dent taken care of. I took care of the whole situation within 2 hours of it happening, but I still feel really shitty about the whole thing. I get triggered by people yelling at me, especially older adults, I got really scared because I didn’t want to get in trouble with my mother (who’s verbally abusive), and I got scared of how the car’s owner would react if her “friend” was that angry with me. I feel bad about how she treated me like a criminal and immediately assumed I was going to run off. I really hate the feeling of being photographed by some stranger because they think I’m a criminal. I hate being photographed by ANYONE and I got photographed by a stranger. I feel like I was violated but like I can’t even say anything because I was the one who made the dent. Thankfully I had enough money to handle it or I’d be freaking out even more. I can’t stop thinking about how these strangers were so angry at me  and both assumed I was going to run off, but the woman who ACTUALLY owned the car was normal polite about it. Does that even make sense? I feel guilty that I even hit the car at all. I feel ashamed and like I can’t tell anyone else except for my friend that was with me. I know other people have done worse - made bigger dents, caused crashes, caused deaths, DUIs, etc. but I feel almost paralyzed by today’s events. I can’t focus on anything because after I was done with being angry, I keep wanting to cry. I feel so stupid for messing up a simple parking spot. I don’t have a therapy appointment until next week. Can anyone else here relate? How do you get over the guilt of hitting a car.... I know this might seem dramatic but as you can probably guess, I have anxiety.

jah8qi,"nature, walk","How I Turned Myself Into A Social Butterfly. Hello! I wasn't always a social butterfly. I used to be shy, full of social anxiety, and unable to express myself the way I wanted to. This was especially bad, because I was in nature an extrovert. I was someone who had a lot of energy to express, but whose mental barriers stopped him from doing so. I was forced to live the life of an introvert and this made me depressed. When I was a kid, I was a happy one. Everything changed when my family had to move cities abruptly at the start of my first year of high school. This was about 6 or 7 years ago. It was a very difficult process for me, I was leaving behind all my childhood friends, and I did not get a chance to say a proper goodbye and to receive closure. This closure came later, when I went to revisit my old school and my old friends a couple of times. I tell you this story to tell you that my high school years were very tough. I was struggling with depression, with acne, with gyno, with OCD, with anxiety, and with a bunch of other issues. I was out of shape, and despite wanting to be popular and have cool friends, I was very lonely and felt rejected. The friends that I did have were considered ""losers"" and I did not want to associate myself with them. I became a bit of a loner. For reference, I am now 20 years old, and I am in University, and I have managed to flip my life upside down, and become a social butterfly. It took a long time and it took a lot of ""risks"". It was a painful process and at times I didn't think it was possible. Below, I will list some of the things that have helped me throughout my process: **1) You need to train your ""bold"" muscle.** Just like physical muscles, we have a social muscle, or as I like to call it, a ""bold"" muscle. Every time we take a social risk, the muscle grows stronger, and our schema of the world grows. The next time we take that same risk, it is much easier because we have already experienced what it is like to take such a risk. During my tough years of high school, I knew that I had very little social skills, and I knew that the only way I could become a ""natural"" was trough experience. It will feel cringe. It will feel awkward. You'll probably be thinking about all of these awkward moments right before going to sleep at night. However, the only way to train your ""bold"" muscle, is, well, to be bold, to take social risks, to do things that you are afraid of. This brings me to my next point. **2) Baby steps.** You're not going to start off as the natural guy who is able to talk to anyone in a confident manner. It will take time, and it will take baby steps. I used to try to train my ""bold"" muscle in the smallest ways possible. For example, in class, I would make it a goal to participate within the first 15 minutes. I didn't care what I said, or if it even made any sense, I simply had to raise my hand and participate within the first 15 minutes. That was a simple goal. Soon, I was able to participate in class whenever I wanted. Another example, is that I made it a goal to have simple conversations with people. Saying hi to acquaintances, or asking people how they're summer went. At first, I was not able to hold conversation for too long, especially with people who I saw as having more value than me, the people who I considered popular. I could maybe only talk for 30 seconds, and then I had to make an excuse to leave. But over time, I was able to train myself to effortlessly have conversation for however long I wanted. I'm at a point now where I can walk up to anyone and be confident and charismatic and feel zero social anxiety. **3) Focus more on goodness rather than status.** This is something that took me a long time to learn, and it was something I needed to experience to learn. I always knew this instinctively but I had to see it for myself, and maybe you need to go through that process too. I always wanted to be popular and so I always wanted popular friends, and I did not care enough about my ""loser"" friends. Everything changed in University. I became quite popular, and was able to talk to anyone, and I had some of the fun that I had missed out on in high school. I even became good friends with quite a few popular guys. But after spending time with people, I stopped caring about status. Now, I purely care about how good a person is, I could care less if they are popular. I care about true friendship. I care about how honest and respectful someone is, how much I vibe with someone, whether that person truly cares for me, whether we have similar tastes and hobbies... If you're only aim is to be friends with popular people, then you are bound to fail, because your intentions are in the wrong place. But this is something that you're probably going to have to learn from experience, simply reading it won't do anything. **4) Put yourself in positions to succeed.** Join clubs, join a sports team, maybe even join a frat if you're in college. The point is, sometimes it's too difficult to do it all yourself. Sometimes you need the environment handed to you. You need a place where you can practice. You need events to go to. You need people to be around. Sometimes you need the excuse of being a part of something like a team or a club in order to talk to people. **5) Self-Improvement in other areas.** Try to work on other areas as well. For example, I started lifting weights in high school. It took me a long time to show progress, but it was worth it. Try to wear well-fitted and nice clothes, they don't have to be expensive. There are a couple cool subreddits dedicated to male fashion. Get a nice haircut, and groom yourself well. Find a barber that you like and stick with him. Study at school, read books, be creative and work on projects and interests that you find interesting. I have a long way to go to figure things out, but simply working on yourself will make you confident in other areas too and will help you on this path to becoming a social butterfly. **Final thoughts.** This entire post is a message to my old self. I know that there are probably people who are in high school or perhaps even younger or older, who are going through a tough time. Perhaps they are extraverts in nature just like I was (someone who gains their energy through social interaction), but perhaps they have too many mental barriers. Perhaps they are shy and filled with social anxiety. Perhaps they lacked the proper role models. Perhaps they are depressed. Perhaps they want to be cool and popular and someone with many friends, and someone who has no fear and can express themselves freely. Perhaps they want to tame their social anxiety and become natural, to be someone who can do what they want when they want in social settings. I'm telling you that it can be done. Practice. Baby steps. Try little things. **Don't get upset at yourself.** I used to get so upset at myself, i'd tell myself that i hated myself, that I was a loser, that I was going to be unhappy forever. It's easy for me to sit here now and say that it won't always be like. But try to have some hope. Try to take some social risks, build that ""bold"" muscle of yours. You'll become a natural one day and maybe you'll be able to help some others. You're going to go through a lot of ups and downs, a lot of failures. Be kind to yourself. **It's a process. It's not linear.** It will be good, then bad, then very bad, and then back to good. It will take time for you to reach a point where there is consistency and stability. Good luck brothers and sisters. Please feel free to comment, ask any questions, or to direct message me asking for advice or help :)",0

Not just public speaking or going on the bus or talking on the phone or going to a restaurant like most people believe social anxiety comes out the most. But for me, I try to hold a conversation with my mother and I’m a blushing, stuttering mess. Talking to my friends, it sometimes takes so much effort to use my voice. I hold everything inside because I can’t voice my thoughts or feelings or concerns. It takes so much effort for me to simply engage in everyday conversation. So much courage. With my friends!!

jguh0k,"running, outside"," I think I accidentally planned a remote date and then kinda flaked cause he wanted to video chat. Am I the worst person ever?. So I met this guy through some mutual friends and we have been texting a lot throughout the day for a few weeks. We live pretty far from each other so we only text. I don’t think I could see him as more than a friend (what does that matter when we live so far) but I genuinely enjoy texting him. Anyway, I jokingly suggested he should carve a pumpkin since he isnt decorating for Halloween. He then said he would if I did too. We picked out a time/day so we could do it at the same time and he even went out and got the supplies. The whole time I was thinking we’d keep updating each other through text and send snap updates. It never crossed my mind that he would want to FaceTime. So the time rolls around and he’s running kinda late. I got all my stuff set up and started working in the living room with my fam around me. Then he asks if I want to FaceTime or anything. I felt so panicked because I was too nervous to and wasn’t mentally prepared for it and was not looking cute. I also already started and couldn’t really move everything I had anywhere else and just feel nervous talking to someone on the phone with a bunch of people in the room. I’m such an idiot because of course he wanted to FaceTime. I made up an excuse that I was already working and thought my fam would be kinda loud but suggested we could snapchat. I then said how I felt bad and how I was sorry that I didn’t plan better. I also said I could move outside so we could FaceTime but he said it wasnt a big deal and we just snap chatted/texted throughout the night. I just felt so horrible when I said I couldn’t Facetime after he went out of his way to get all of this stuff to do something solely because of me. Idk what’s wrong with me but I was just too nervous to do it. I’ve only met him once and have barely spoken to him in person. He is the sweetest guy I have ever met though. He didn’t finish carving his and I didn’t either which makes me think he is going to try to get me to FaceTime him tonight. I feel obligated to now and feel like it’s a cute idea but the thought of it makes me panicked. Was I in the wrong to kinda blow him off? Should I just do it if he asks again? ",0

Subconsciously I put my hand over my ears when someone is talking about something that I find awkward or when my stress is too much. I still can't look people in the eyes because I feel like they will see how I feel or how week I am If the cashier sees me outside a store I feel bad and can't enter because they already saw me . I feel awkward to ask someone for helping no matter in food or clothing store so if I like something that I can't reach because I am short I just don't buy it . I hate talking to the phone unless the person is Someone I know very well and even then I avoid it. I feel bad when I call to fast food or to make appointment as if I am taking from their time or I am annoying . Every time when someone have problem hearing me in Starbucks for example or when I anciently walk Infront of someone I feel as if I made the biggest mistake . I analyse even the smallest sign of dissatisfaction in people's faces especially my parents and even if I know it has no reason or the reason is not me I still feel as terrible person There are situations where driven by my desire to help people my brain stop worrying and I speak to strangers but most of the time I can't start conversation. I also hate people seeing me helping even if they will think I am lazy if they never see me do something I prefer that over they seeing me helping.,0
k2acp0,"walk, running"," You can improve with baby steps. The biggest issue with SA is avoidance. Without exposing yourself to your fears, you can't overcome them. But avoidance doesn't come only with big situations like a oral presentation or an important meeting. You may have realized that you also avoid little things, like looking to a pretty person or saying certain words that might make you stutter. If you look at someone and they stare back at you, you start to feel warm, nervous, and you immediately look away. If you're walking down the street and trip on your feet, your first thought is that everybody saw it and is now laughing at you. So you look down to the ground and try to escape the situation as fast as you can. How about instead of looking away and running, you take a deep breath and look a little longer at that other person while she looks at you too? Or maybe look around you the next time you trip and see if someone actually saw what happened? I was thinking about this approach today. I tried it myself but it's too early to say if it works or not. I need to practice it for some days to say for sure, but i hope it works. Maybe you all can try it too? What do you have to lose? ",0

On Monday I went to my first job ever to Subway, and I thought it was going to be fine, but they piled on loads of work onto me. Like, way too much for a 4 hour shift. It was basically a list of how to run the entire store. The manager who was training me was extremely rushed and behind in everything, so everything she explained to me was confusing and overwhelming. Whats more is that I was only going to have two days of training and then after that I was literally going to be working by myself. The entire store. And closing by myself. It seemed like what you’d give a manager as a job, not a new hire without any experience. That Subway only had two managers and me working there. I was so overwhelmed by the end of the day, I went home and cried. I quit that job after the first day, but its had such an effect on me that I’m completely anxious by the thought of having any job at all, in fear that all jobs are gonna be the same. Ever since Monday I’ve had fluctuating anxiety, it leads to panic attacks thinking about even having a job. My parents want me to get another job as soon as possible but the thought of getting one so quickly after that is so distressing.

I bought everyone (mom, dad, brother) a gift card and one gift. I only spent about $40 on my mom. The *problem* is that I come from a wealthy family and it makes me feel absolutely horrible. There are countless gifts under the tree right now. To make matters worse, the gift I bought is SO small. It's this skincare product that my mom wanted. I just feel...pathetic. I'm going to have this tiny bag with a gift card inside the xmas card and this puny little product that only cost $20. I'm always insecure about the gifts I buy but this year it's worse.

Something that really bothers me about my social anxiety is how much it hinders me from progressing in my life. I have gone out of my way since i was 16 years old to only work a job where im alone 95% of the time and the other 5% of the time is extremely minimal social interaction. IE - a food delivery driver. I am about to turn 23 years old and this is the only job I have ever done. Not that its a bad job, actually the contrary. However the only reason i chose this job in the first place is purely out of my fear of social situations. Well today that all changes. Last week I started to work at a Cannabis Dispensary. Which is really cool, I have had a passion for this sort of thing. But up until today all I was doing was trimming flower (so I could still be by myself and not talk to anybody) Today, is my first day behind the counter. Let's just say I am terrified. I feel like im going to shit myself lol. I have to leave in 20 minutes and I have been contemplating calling in sick all morning. I even thought of quitting. Isnt this shit just ridiculous. It feels like im possessed sometimes. But im going to fight it. 7 years now I have let myself just be comfortable and not try to do anything which may improve my life purely out of fear. I dont know what will happen today and im sure its going to be tough. But I just wanted to make this post to let all of you know that I love you, and you're not alone.

l8mo7n,"running, walk"," Pro tip from my therapist: accept your anxiety. The reason i hate dealing with people so much is because how they make me feel anxious. I don't hate people, i hate the uncomfortable feeling i get when i interact with them. I avoid socializing because i want to avoid that feeling. My therapist told me something that my might be game changer for me: A first step would be to accept your anxiety. It's a natural part of you just like having hair on your head and fingers on your hand. Being nervous will make anyone uncomfortable but it doesn't prevent you from functioning. You can still work while nervous, you can still talk while nervous, you can still do anything while being nervous. If you learn to not give it any attention you'll realize it's not the end of the world, and you can still enjoy the moment even if you're nervous. Is just another feeling. Running from it won't help. I remembered this today when going to the grocery store. Well, i was still anxious, but accepting the feeling made my head lighter, and as i walked around i could feel myself calming down.

l9vv7k,outside,"Why i want to die. Hey everyone. I'm a 24 year old male from the Philippines who's recently moved to another country. I've had social anxiety my whole life. I have zero social skills. I can't talk or connect with anyone; everyone thinks I'm weird. I thought all this was because I didn't know much so I started reading, watching movies and documentaries, playing video games and took up many other hobbies. Alas, I didn't improve one bit. In high school I had a few friends. I moved to college and didn't make a single friend. I then changed colleges and moved to a new country. Stupid decision since I couldn't even make friends in my own country. Here, my anxiety has only increased. The thing is, I've never partied, had alcohol, had sex, had a partner, haven't even had a female friend. I get nervous around people, especially women that I'm attracted to. Today, my floormate offered to have me meet with his friends. My stupid ass said ok and when the time came I pretended I was asleep. They thought I was not in my room. I overheard those guys say how weird I was and all and it's absolutely broken me. I tried to be as nice as possible to him. Those guys were even making fun of me when I'd woken up and thought I could hear them. Whatever the case this isn't the first time such a thing has happened to me. My depression is over the roof right now. I literally want to kill myself. Why am I like this? What did I do to deserve this? Perhaps it is my fault. Maybe I shouldn't be a creep. I'm a grown ass man and I'm in tears right now. I've never been popular with girls, they've always thought Im a creep. Never been popular with the guys, they've always treated me like a weirdo.

I spend my whole day laying in my room too scared to go outside or even ask my suitemate for anything. He is a social butterfly. Lucky him. Perhaps therapy will work. If it doesn't I don't think I'll carry the will to live any longer. I have such big plans for my future. I want to be a public speaker. The worst profession I could've wanted for myself given my current situation.

lo1vks,skating,"Relationship Anxiety - Not sure if I’m unreasonably irritated because of my anxiety or if I should be a bit cautious. TLDR: Angry kind of anxiety for the first time - not sure if it’s a true or false alarm. Need tips and perspective. Thank you! Okay, I’m posting again. My apologies. I am just having a rough few days. I have moderate social anxiety that has been leaning towards severe the past few days and social cues have been incredibly incomprehensible for me. I am hoping for kind folks here to help me see things objectively. So, I posted that there has been a texting mishap with my new SO two days ago and we sorted it out. I was still feeling anxious for some reason but I tend to find a new thing to be anxious about every time so I figured this is just a case of it. I decided to ask him out to a cute date tomorrow. I asked him if he wanted to go ice skating with me again or build a blanket fort, and he said he wanted to do both. He seemed excited. But I found out from his Facebook page around 8 pm (he knows I follow his professional page - he’s dabbling into broadcasting) that he’s on air tomorrow evening/night. I have always been super supportive of his hobby and am a fan of his broadcasts! It is just I thought we were spending the night together because that’s what we always do and he didn’t even let me know he’s planning to work the night until around midnight! He asked if we can meet early afternoon. I am quite irritated on top of anxious by then but tried to stay calm and told him it’s okay but I thought he was doing his thing in the afternoons as usual. And he told me he’s still trying to figure out what the “usual” is. I always look forward to our weekends and I think he does as well - but this response didn’t sit well with me. Granted, I like planning things way ahead because having things planned out gives me some sort of calmness. He can also be an anxious person but he is extremely spontaneous and plans things last minute. We both learned to compromise and he usually confirms plans at the end of work day on Fridays (we verbalize that we will see each other next weekend at the end of each date). I’ve just been almost feeling angry since midnight and it’s 2 am now. This is an angry kind of anxiety I’m feeling is for the first time in three months I’ve been with him, I’m actually mad at him. My body is trying to push me into the fight or flight mode but because I have BPD along with anxiety, I learned in group therapy that this might be a false alarm for folks like me. Not sure how to identify what I’m feeling is valid or reasonable and how to process this new type of irritated/angry kind of anxiety. Some perspective and tips will be much appreciated.

I am not usually an awkward person as I've really (almost) mastered the social masking. However, today in my art therapy class I had to present two pieces I made. I'm not embarrassed to share anything about trauma or social anxiety but something about my pieces being about very current struggles made me just feel sick to my stomach as soon as I stepped into the class. I cover up anxiety usually with jokes and weed but I obviously needed to be alert. As soon as I stood up I immediately I got shaky  and started crying. They encouraged me to continue since everyone was sharing very personal stories and someone was bound to cry. I just didn't think it would be me. I cried to whole way through. I even put my glasses down so I couldn't see them anymore and continued as contained as I could but I still had tears running down my eyes and all over my mask. I don't know these people really. The 3 in the class I kind of know are very surface level. Out of all of the embarrassing things I've done this one humiliated me. The way this program works means I see this same group of people for about 6-8 hours every week for the next like 2 years. I wish I could take it all back and not said much of anything about my art. A couple people I know said some nice feedback during the presentation but no one said anything to me afterwards. I don't know if they were avoiding me or if I just avoided eye contact and shut them out. I just really shut off afterwards and pretended nothing happened, I even bought one of them a meal during break. I guess as an I'm sorry. Sometimes I can be outgoing but the slight amount of raw vulnerability exposes me. I can't sleep, just feel rotten to my core. I have another class with them tomorrow morning and I have to show more of my art. Luckily it's old stuff and just more of a portfolio review so I won't need to describe them.

ltf0og,outdoor,"I just started a new job as a hostess for an outdoor dining restaurant. This month I recently just started a job as a hostess for a restaurant. The vibe of my coworkers and my managers are honestly very fine, no one is mean, but no one is also too nice. It’s more acknowledgment of another human working. I appreciate that I’ve made a new friend at my new workplace. However, I still get so much anxiety talking to strangers, such as customers. When I was getting interviewed for this position, I asked what’s the most difficult part about being a hostess? My manager said “dealing with behavioral customers or learning how to execute communication” One of my main goals with this restaurant is to learn how to communicate, verbalize my words, rather than staying quiet. My previous job was a restocking associate for a retail store. I didn’t require much speaking unless I needed to speak to my managers. It was a good job to work as a first job for someone who was 17. But I’m nearly 22, and I felt no growth working there even if it was a chill job. Now with this new job, I feel like I have to mentally prepare myself for people. Communication is one of the key essentials for my job. I thought I was doing fine, but my mistake- I looked at Yelp reviews for my restaurant. There were at least 5 different reviews, regarding the staff. Specially the hostess and servers. I read that I’ve come off as rude, pretentious, and condescending, but on my point of view, I’m actually just scared shitless. The function of my job is explaining to over 100+ people per day about the prices of our specials, how seating works for outdoor dining, how long to wait when there’s a waitlist, and how there’s an automatic gratuity because of outdoor dining and covid. Basically almost all the guidelines regarding outdoor dining for our restaurant. I don’t want to sound like I’m people pleasing and like I’m trying to control the way people perceive me. But I feel maybe my communication must be off if people do view me as rude and pretentious when in reality I’m actually VERY scared of people 😅 during my last shift, it was a full house, and I felt my stress and anxiety rising up because I felt a heavy sensory overload. I felt like it was about to eat me up. I ended up just stepping aside, smoke a little bit and drink some water to calm myself down. Is there any way I can improve on my communication or my gestures as I speak? Is there a proper way to reduce my anxieties when it feels like it’s getting worse?? Or learning how to deal with the customers that have selective hearing 😅",0

I really hope it's not this because they're one of my favorites and we have been losing teachers. I've already lost another teacher earlier this year. Reasons why this could be it: they've asked only the upcoming seniors to come and later there will be a meeting for the rest of the class. Reasons why this might not be this: I emailed them yesterday about a question about something relating to class and they seemed to be in a good mood. My school is also going 100% in person in two weeks so it's gonna be as close to a new normal since last March.

I notice people back when i was at school hanging out with other people they never did in the past and makes me feel like im doing something wrong. Any tips on how i can get out there?,0

mjdfr1,outside,"How do people do it? How can I do it?. I'm 20F, been developing social fear since I was about 7/8 years old I suppose. How do people do it. It's one thing reading their stories but it seems impossible to me, made up if you will. My best friend doesn't deal with this, her approach is to just shove me into situations where I'm extremely uncomfortable. ""Just go out and talk to people"". I moved away from everything I was familiar with, including my few friends. I was terrified. And she just told me ""go out and make friends"" because she views me as a loner. She said it as if it's easy, like you go outside and boom a friend. I think she's still stuck in the perspective of being sat with someone in a classroom. She also likes the idea of going to pubs and restaurants (which I hate, it's my worst nightmare). She's been supportive up until recently and now all I get is a ""that's your problem to deal with, not mine"" when I'm just expressing stress. I never even asked for her to coddle me, I was just venting. Quarantine has made things worse, I no longer work a customer service job (which initially helped me a lot with communication) but I never made friends with anyone. If anything I made enemies. Once lockdown restrictions ease up my current coworkers will most likely invite me out. How do I push down the feeling that they're just being nice out of pity? The looming feeling that they don't actually want to be around me? They're the same people but it's a different setting. I haven't been to a pub in months. I've never been to the pub they go to. The thought of it all makes me want to cry and hide. I can get so scared to the point I can't even talk. I haven't been to a shop for 6 months. I hate going anywhere alone. Another one of my friends hypocrisies is that I need to brave up and go on my own to places whilst also preaching about how unsafe women are on their own in public. How is that supposed to make me feel better when I'm literally the world's easiest target? I'm supposed to just go out and talk to people whilst also avoiding people because they could have malicious intentions and I'd make myself a target but then it's be my fault because I spoke to that person. I'm trying to understand her points but she just contradicts herself and it's not helping me. I have a hard enough time figuring out social interactions and for her to just hit me with those is really confusing. She'll probably see this. I'm scared, I'm lonely, I feel like everyone only talks to me out of pity.",0

mtd10s,outside,"Feeling Missed Out,. Hey guys , I'm 24 M. I thought a lot about this 'thing' that I'm facing and in the end i found this sub, and thought Id get help here. Before I specifically get into my problem, it's important to understand that few people consider me to have no social anxiety because I really interact well with others, especially people and friends from college. They think that I'm headed to a successful life. Now coming to couple of family members and cousins , I'm the opposite, it's usually me being on the outside looking at them. We meet only at family functions and I get butterflies in my stomach a week from the function, thinking of different scenarios to not be awkward. I end up being the dude who is social awkward and does not interact much, whereas to the outside world or atleast a couple of others I'm like the opposite person. I thought maybe my ability to speak fluent English is the reason why I might be feeling this way, I also have this weird problem of limiting myself to just a handshake where the situation expects a hug, I imagine scenarios where they find out that I'm a big time socially skilled individual, AKA my other side etc but in the end it's just a whiff of day dream I have while I look them from outside. To be clear I don't really need to be with them, this is just an example where I thought solving issue with this context will help me solve other situations as well. I also think maybe my slightly obese body have fucked up my confidence? I have no ide what the root cause is. Does anyone have any tips for me? Would be great if you did. :)",0
mtf501,walk,"I get really nervous walking past people. I’ve had this for about 2 to 2.5 years now, but it’s recently gotten worse. I am 14 male btw. But basically, when I’m walking and there is another person or especially a group of people walking and I see them in front of me, it makes me very nervous. I get really anxious, especially if they look intimidating or if they are around my age or even worse if I know them from school. It’s recently gotten worse because I just went back to going to school and everything started to open again after being in lockdown for so long. I am pretty much never my true self at school, I have friends, although I wouldn’t consider them real friends, it’s fine though since I don’t really like having too many friends anyway. I really want my anxiety in general to just stop. It affects my life way too much, my parents know about it but they just say I’m shy and that it will get better when I get older, I just gotta socialise more. I think they’re right but idk about the fact that I’m just shy, I’m more than just shy. The thing that makes me so nervous about walking past people (mainly when they are facing me) is that I don’t know where to look or how to act or what to do. I get so nervous that sometimes I grind my teeth or even sweat a little. The fact that I get this nervous about stuff like this is too much, and idk how to help it, please comment anything that could help me or any of your own experiences no matter your age, gender or wether you think it’s helpful or not. School starts tomorrow for me, and I’m already very nervous of going back. The thing is, my parents think I hate school because I don’t like the learning part of it. Well the truth is that I actually enjoy some lessons, and that’s not the problem. The problem is I have to socialise 5 days a week with hundreds of strangers and a few “friends”. I really dislike it. One last thing: I come from Italy, and I left Italy when I was 3, but I grew up and I am growing up in an Italian household. The thing is, with Italian people and kids, I have like no anxiety at all! I love how friendly they are and how they make you feel so at home. When we go on holiday back in Sicily where I was born, (sicily is an italian island), I can just walk around and talk to everyone and anyone. I feel so free and happy and everything is great. Here in the UK, everything is so depressing, and people are generally so cold and they just cause me anxiety. In Italy, my anxiety goes from 100% to like 8%. It’s crazy.

I'm 20 now and about to graduate from college. I don't feel like I've grown at all. I have trichotillomania, which is the uncontrollable urge to pull out my own hair. I have huge bald spots and I've never felt confident about my appearance. I've never been in a relationship or even on a date. had a big group of friends in middle and high school, but I always felt like the odd one out. I only ever felt really close to one of them, because on my first day of middle school, they kind of adopted me. Then her friends became my friends. But in the group of us all, I only really felt truly comfortable around her. If she wasn't at an event, or at lunch one day, I didn't really feel comfortable to hang around the others on my own. I ate by myself those days. I always felt bad because I felt like I was too clingy to her. Then we graduated from high school and everyone went away to their different universities. Those who did stay have their own schedules and other friend groups, so I never really see them. Quarantine didn't help. I still talk to one friend from high school regularly, but she's incredibly busy. I don't have a license so I can't drive to see her. She has a license but doesn't drive. I'm going to graduate from college in a few months. I'm studying film. But I don't feel like I did much. When we had simulated sets or group projects I got overwhelmed and would go retreat to what I call my ""designated crying stall"" in the bathroom or my bench. I would rush through lab hours just so I could go home. I don't think I've made any friends at school. None that have lasted more than a few months, anyway. Since set work overwhelmed me I thought I'd try writing. But when I write I get sad because I get jealous of my own characters. They have friends and relationships and are brave. They have full heads of hair. I just feel really lonely. I've been so lonely for so many years and I'm just so tired of it. I don't want to be anymore. I want Covid go be over so I can at least go out and try to make friends again. But even when it does end, I won't be at school anymore. I wouldn't even know where to meet anybody. I don't think I'd have the courage to do it anyway. I just feel so trapped.",0

I have been this way since as long as I can remember and people pleased and altered myself to best fit what was required in the situation to the point that I literally do not know who I am. I don’t think I have real opinions. I neglect voicing anything because I know if someone was to object to me with even an average argument, I’d probably agree with them (I used to think this is a good thing because I’m open to new and intelligible information, but I’m not so sure anymore, as I feel weak and walked over now).

n8xc3n,outside,"Not sure where to start when it comes to dating.. I'm pretty sure this is the appropriate subreddit for this question. Not 100% sure though. Hello. So I'm really needing some advice. I'm a 25 year old guy who has practically no dating experience. I hardly have any experience with women outside of casual frindship. I've tried dating apps before, but I've never had good luck. I think it's mainly due to personal concerns. I'll elaborate. So probably the biggest thing for me would be mentioning my job. On the apps I was on, most of the girls are going into collage, and getting into fancy careers. I'm happy for them but then I look at myself. I tried college but it never worked out for me. So I'm just working a lot in retail. Generally speaking, girls want to be with guys that can financially support them. I feel like I wouldn't be able to measure up to all the hard work they are putting into college. Sure there are exceptions to men being the main bread winners but due to how I was raised, I believe it is my job to earn the money. I just think if a girl met me, that she wouldn't be super thrilled by the fact I work retail and not some other high dollar, fancy job. So this makes me loose confidence. I do have 2 jobs if that context is useful working a total of nearly 50 hours a week. Another thing that bugs me is my living situation. Most girls my age (according to my perspective) have their own apartment or shared apartment. I come close to that, but not quite. I rent a room in a house. Not my parents house, but another house. It's not owned by a relative or anything like that. This bugs me because it makes me feel like a girl would pass on me because she would feel it would be a downgrade. I'm 25 after all... Next, my body. So I'm 220LBS and nearly 6ft. I'm not in shape at all. I'm nowhere close to a gym type of guy. I also don't have the best of diets either. I know I can change this, but for now, this is where I stand on this topic. Next, I don't feel like I properly talk to girls. Typically I just like to relax and hope on a good conversation by introducing different subjects. Due to the way I am, if I don't feel like the other person cares about the conversation, I just forget about them. This leaves the thought of maybe she actually does like me and I didn't really give too much effort in the convo. I especially think this if she miraculously texts me first. Also, Idk how to even flirt. Lastly, I have no idea how to capture a good pic of myself. In the past, I've used selfies but I found out that those don't work at all. I don't have much friends either so that makes pictures more challenging. I'm considering getting a tripod and taking some pics of me outside but idk if that will make things better. I almost feel like I'm too late to the party and all the girls I'd be happy with have long since been taken. I know this likely isn't the case, but it seems accurate from my perspective. Hopefully I'm making sense here. If not, feel free to ask for clarification. Anyway I welcome advice or anything that could help me. Thanks!",0

So much so that i started crying even more. My mom had to be in the area so she dropped me off. I texted her that I can't do it, I can't get in. She said she's dissapointed. I just know my actions result in her yelling at me. I want to die. So so bad. I'm a burden. That's what she tells me anyways.

The thing is that not even like, for 4 months I went to that gym, was enough for me to get used to the ambience. I just felt observed at every moment. I was too scared to go to the instructor to ask him for a routine, but I knew I had to do it or else I wouldn't know what to do. I was constantly thinking, what I if I'm doing this exercise wrong? What if they're secretly laughing or making faces at me? I even reached the point where I completely skipped an exercise because there was already another person using that machine. Another thing that discouraged me to keep going was the fact I was surrounded by super buff dudes who lifted super heavy weights, and I was the only weak one who could barely lift a pair of small weights.

nqcgz1,"skating, run, walk","Trapped in a job. Didn’t know where to post this but social anxiety is the primary cause for these issues. I’m starting to discover after a very long (but incomplete!) journey of overcoming social anxiety, I prefer to work as a team. My very first job was in fast food 6 years ago and I wasn’t able to handle that, but going back to the basics and working somewhere like Auntie Anne’s or Domino’s (simple, small confined space, not too many different tasks to learn, PLENTY of coworkers who can help me out if something goes wrong) seems really appealing to me. Plus the shifts tend to fly by. I had such a horrible first job experience that I steered so far away from fast food and seeked out retail, front desk jobs, and then got into housekeeping (although I worked at a low-stress skating rink snack bar and a froyo shop for a bit in-between). But really I think housekeeping, retail, front desk etc. are worse for me in the long run because I'm all alone there. I'm the one in charge and the manager on duty and I feel like I have to know everything or do everything right or else I'm a failure. All the pressure is on me to get the job done right. Even though I feel a bit old to be falling back onto fast food (I'm nearly 23) and it may be a little harder to pay for some things, the social, laid back feel of a job is what I really need rn. Anyways...to my current job: I do housekeeping at a retirement community. Been there for about a month. I clean resident apartments and one day out of my 5 day week I do janitorial, out-of-room cleaning. I don’t know what it is but something about the social dynamics here is so overwhelming to me. From interacting with the bitchy nurses and trying to communicate clearly with the elderly while being the only person in my department on my floor, it can feel isolating and dreadful. All I do is take out garbage on my out-of-room day and I'm the only housekeeper there so I get a ton of demands. Several times I felt like I was going to burst into tears. I want to cry when I get out of bed in the mornings. It makes me consider drinking alcohol on the job. I've been taking some of my mom's medical marijuana to just have a lighter mental state. I told my managers my thoughts and they offered to let me switch departments, but I'd only be doing part-time work and that I'd have to wait until they find a replacement for me until I can switch over. I said I'd think about it but I really only just want one job where I always know what I'm gonna be doing, and I want to quit. Somebody already almost made me cry today and I was so tempted to just walk out and drive home. But I can't quit on the whim because it would really inconvenience my coworkers and the residents. Plus my managers talked to like 5 different references of mine and I really don't want to look bad. I am deeply empathetic for the community but I don’t know how much longer I can go into work being on the verge of tears. I'm thinking I'll wait until the end of the week to see if any of the places I applied to hire me and tell my current job I already secured a new one and I start next week. People with big boy, corporate jobs get to quit and leave immediately. So I can do it too...right? But idk if I’ll be able to forgive myself. TL;DR scared to quit job I just started that is causing me mental health problems due to no one being available to do my job",0

I have VERY bad work anxiety and I soon learned that desk-work isn't for me... but what job is? I have worked retail, a few days in logistics/warehousing, estate maintenance/tree surgery, hospitality and nothing really seems to keep me interested. I also struggle connecting with people and making conversation, this really affects how I do my job (when I have one) because I feel uncomfortable all the time. I am really worried that I will never have a full-time job and be an independent person. Does anyone else have any experiences like this? Like you're on a treadmill in life and nothing is happening? I felt so bad when I left, that I didn't even feel like coming home and I just sat in Tesco car park in my car for two hours until I ran out of water. This is not a sob story; I am simply asking for help and advice because I sometimes don't feel like being here anymore (I haven't told my family this). Please share your experiences, along with any advice on career paths, improving social skills and overcoming what is clearly ergophobia (the deep and persistent fear of being employed). TL;DR: Please can I have career advice for someone who struggles with panic and learning.",0
oh86n5,running,Going to the grocery store is the worst. Especially if I’m going alone. Which is 98% of the time. I can’t even describe it. It just feels like I’m wrong and I don’t belong. I can’t handle the running kids everywhere and accidentally bumping into others. I literally dread going. I want to do instacart but I’m not financially set up for that yet. Anyone else feel like this? Let me know.,0
oi59y5,running,"Feeling hopeless and need to vent. 24M here feeling like I just need to get some stuff out somewhere and hopefully this is allowed here. So a little background first I guess: I've always been a quiet kind of guy, friends were made through friends of people I know and kind of sat back and let conversations play out. Well a few years ago I moved away from one of the few towns I've called home to start a life with my partner on the other side of the country (UK) and due to that stopped talking to the few friends I had as I was struggling to keep my life afloat just with work and figuring out the ins and outs of running a household. Throw in a few traumatic life events and I basically just imploded. Should probably also mention I've been dealing with depression for over a decade. Anyway, not talking to my family and friends for a long time seems to have thrown me into my anxiety tenfold. Even though I now have more contact recently with my sister and my mother, with whom it's always been close-knit amongst the three of us, and I have no trouble with talking or explaining things to my amazingly supportive partner; with all others, even once close friends, I just can't bring myself to initiate a conversation let alone hold one together. It makes me feel like a sociopath sometimes, like when one of my previously close friends who asks my family about me a lot suffered a bereavement recently. I had to look up and ask my partner how I should express my condolences! I just couldn't think of what to say and this has happened for multiple different occasions. I can't even start a conversation with people who I might want to get to know as the question of how they're doing or general ice breakers don't occur to me, my mind just goes blank and I can't think of anything. The worst part for me is that it's not just limited to face to face. Talking to others online, be it through a chat or even VOIP in games (I hate to imagine a video call!), I can't bring myself to interact with anyone as there is a constant deep feeling of fear that I struggle to overcome. Even as I type this I am second guessing myself and wondering whether to even post it. I think that's probably all I have to say at the moment, I just needed to get it out I guess. Here's hoping the stronger prescription and a third/fourth year of talking therapy might help solve my issues. If you made it this far, thank you for reading, hope it didn't get anyone else feeling down",0
okg98f,run,"It's possible, I'm getting better. Hi friends, I wanted to share an exciting revelation I've had, which is that my social anxiety is getting better. I am overjoyed about this because not long ago I was thinking I would be this way forever, but alas. We always dread the fact that if you want to get better you have to do the uncomfortable part of socializing. Yes, I think this is certainly part of it. But there's also some key mindsets I've found myself in that I really think help as well. I thought I'd share them in the hopes that they inspire someone. Sorry, it turned out long, but hopefully worth the read!... Self-forgiveness. This is huge. I think it's massively importantly to be so, so utterly kind to yourself. When you slip up and say something cringe, try to laugh and move on. When you fail to go to that event, think of it as your disorder acting up -- not that you failed -- and forgive yourself. Talk to yourself as you would a friend, or a younger sibling, or even a child. We are all deserving of nothing but kindness from ourselves. Boundaries. Specifically, when to push them and when to reinforce them. This is all up to your gut and your knowledge of yourself and obviously look different for everyone. For example, I would never go to a bar -- it's simply not in my character. That is a boundary I have chosen to adhere to, and we all are allowed and deserving of boundaries in life. If someone were to ask me to go to one I would simply suggest a cafe instead. On the flip side, going on a blind date is something I recently did, and it was certainly a push of my boundaries. But I knew that the fear of the date was just my anxiety. So I went. It was super hard but I knew it was a boundary I could challenge -- knowing that if I ""failed"", I could forgive myself and move on. Don't be ashamed. Talk openly. This is very uncomfortable at first, I really struggled to tell anyone about my social anxiety for years. But I promise it is the right thing to do. Tell a parent, a friend, a stranger. You've already made one step by joining this sub. I find that speaking about it through social media is much easier (maybe some of you find this, too?) and so I do it readily, there. This disorder, and the spectrum of introversion, have really come out a lot in the past year and a half in mainstream media. We can be accepted. Take Covid as a positive. Of course this is a terrible pandemic but if we get a little more personal for a sec, we can see the good in it! I have used Covid as a practice run for when we open up again. Behind a screen with my camera off I have been given the opportunity to ""mute"" and ""unmute"" as I see fit, practicing for when I go back to school and am expected to speak in critiques, meetings, what have you. With everyone living moreso at our pace of live this past year + 1/2, this is a time for us to take a deep breath, practice good habits, and get ready to slowly face the world. Of course, all of these things can only happen if you want them to. We DO have control over our lives, as much as we sometimes like to pretend it's not up to us. Getting better begins with a choice. I really recommend you take it. I've never been happier in my life than now, as I start to see progress. For reference, I am 21 years old and have dealt with social anxiety maybe my whole life, but notably since I was 12. I give you this reference because I want you to know that this takes time. I don't mean to say that all of this is easy, because it's certainly not. But keep pushing. Keep testing your limits, and saying ""yes"", and practicing, and you can get there too. Thanks for reading, I hope someone does at least. This is really exciting to me.",0
omle3y,"park, coast", Just wanna rant.... I don’t know if this is even the right place to post this on but just wanna let everything out and be heard. Okay here I go. I went to a water/theme park with my bf and his family today. Was nervous af the whole time. Idk if its just me but I have fun a different way than everyone else. I like to just sit there and chill doing nothing and that’s still fun for me. I didn’t wanna go on any of the rides or slides my bf knew that I told him before we even went. I just wanted to chill and just be there. Which other people might see it as a waste of time and money but that’s still fun for me. I was completely okay with my bf just leaving me behind with his family while he went off to ride roller coasters and stuff like that with his cousins and siblings. But he wouldn’t listen lol and that made me upset and I got mad. Of course. Here I go ruining everything when Im trying so hard not to. I get upset when my dad does this to me thats why I went with my bf to have a chance to be happy without my dad spoiling it with his attitude and then Im doing what I hate most. I don’t wanna be like my dad and Im exactly like him. It sucks. And then when I was standing waiting for my bf at the roller coaster thing I heard a lady say to someone else “if ur that miserable why even go? What a waste of money.” I felt like she was definitely talking about me. I was having fun but In my own way. But no one understands that. I just feel so terrible I feel like his family thinks Im a “b word” or they hate me because I was just there. I feel like they also think I was just a waste of money and time. ,0

Worst yet, He grouped me with a bunch of obnoxious athletic boys.

Then, the boys rudely shouted ""GO"" I felt like smacking their heads full force with the ball. So there I went, sweating and anxiously bouncing this ball up and down. I was horrible at sports and basketball, so I did so bad. meanwhile the boys waiting in line were making fun of me and one even said ""Bruh he cant even dribble"" When I finally went around the dum cones I gave the ball to the next kid in line and sat down.

oxks2a,pool,"I have given up on human connection at this point.. Where do I start with this post? I don't even know if this is the right place because I struggle with social anxiety. I'm currently 25 years old. I don't really have friendships to speak up and admittedly, have never been kissed, still have the V card, and never had a girlfriend. Long story short, was never the type to make friends in my upbringing. So by the time high school came, I didn't really participate in the social aspects of it. I admit it. My mother has played a dominating presence in my life. Financials greatly impacted my college experience. I really wanted to move out for my college experience. I and my mother had intense arguments but ultimately there wasn't anything I could do. So I lived at home through my college years. Been working and living at home ever since. I have never moved out until now. Looking back, I was greatly naive on just how expensive college was. I have come to understand where my mother was coming from. I can't help however but resent everything how it went down. To this day, I still desire the college experience I never got to have. But the person I hate the most is in fact me. I should have worked harder in high school. I wish I was more aware. Maybe I could have gotten a scholarship at UCLA or another UC and used that to my leverage to force my mom's hand. I'm 25 now but lacking the social moments that my peers my age have already had already. To put it short, I'm the book on the shelf that is covered in dust. I am in fact 18 years old in my own mind. It's taken a while but I've come to accept that I will never have the college experience I desired nor is my adolescence or early 20's gonna come back. But I will not lie and say I don't really like what's potentially in front of me. People my age are busier are now. Their social groups are closed and even if you happen to find a social group of people my age, I'll feel like I'll be the least important member of the group as I came in so late. Whatever friend I make at this point, I just can't but be unsatisfied. I admit it's shallow but even if I find that one rare good friend, I can't help but see that we're all adults now. The biggest of all, despite sometime left, marriage and children are something that is beginning to loom. I will most likely never have a period in my life where my friends can be just that. My friends. Without the whole stupid cycle of returning to suburbia. I still want to do dumb teenage things. Crazy parties and raves till dawn. Experimenting drugs on the body. Coachella. Overly passionate young romance. But I know people my age don't want to do these things as they use to. I can't help but feel alone in my age group. To the people my age and older, having dinner doesn't really count. Why would I want to be friends with an age group that I know will leave the party early? If it was up to me. Yes. Every single person in my friend group would be around 18 to 20. Same thing goes for my romantic relationships. But I also recognize that chances of having relationships like this are low and society will hate me for it. My only defense is, having friends of that age and being romantically involved with someone that age is just better suited for my maturity and is more practical for the long term. To the women my age, I'm sorry. But marriage and children is something I won't be ready for until my early 40's at the very latest, and that's only if I get lucky. I am not all out on marriage and children, but this societal pressure scares me. I resent the fact that people my age are practically my pool for human connection. Even though it is never coming back, being an adolescent is still something I want. Social interaction at this age just feels so different and I don't like it. My adolescence is something that is always going to be unfulfilled. Even though I don't think someone you only see once in three weeks is really your friend, adult friendships are all that I have. I have thought about my long-term goal of moving to France but like I posted here, socially what would it give? The more I get older, the fewer people want friends especially as an English-speaking foreigner. I still lean towards pursuing this goal only because of potential EU citizenship. Socially, however, the social rewards would not be as fruitful as I didn't reach France till older age. In actuality, I expect no reward at all other than becoming a French citizen. In summary, I have given up on friendship, finding a partner, and human connection in general. It's kinda too late for me. Even though I vastly overshared on this post, I can't help but feel empty. I attempted suicide just nearly one year ago today. My family still doesn't know that I tried to drown myself in San Francisco. However, I'm willing to do it again. Maybe in Europe this time. I feel like I want my adolescence more than I want life at this moment. I mean it when I say I want to die. I want to remove myself from the picture. I apologize for such a long post.",0

paaboo,bay," Exposure is not working for me, what about you?. One of the principles that a lot of people talk about when it comes to beat social anxiety is exposure therapy, which my counselor suggested me Exposing ourselves to discomfort should gradually make our body and minds used to that discomfort and it should eventually disappear. This is not happening for me, my social anxiety during these years has become from mild to severe, every time I need to get out from home is like going for a bayonet charge in world war one. More specifically anxiety symptoms start even the day before I know I have to attend a social event or I have to see people for whatever reason, even my closest ones, when I am on my way to meet other humans is when the most severe symptoms happens, shaking, insanely high heartbeat rate, dizziness ecc.. Then the actual interaction happens and even then, symptoms are skyrocketing, but as time passes I slowly start to calm down until I reach the point where I say ''Really? all this worrying and suffering for what?'' and I start feeling like a normal person. The issue is that this happens everyday, I do exposure every day but the next morning it's like my brain resets and forgets about the previous exposure and starts the cycle of fear again, I am starting loosing hope, It became invalidating .

He wasn’t there when I was taking to the other guy but I assume they would talk amongst themselves about the people they take skydiving. I am 22 and look my age so it’s not like he would just think I am young and shy either.

But it feels like there is this motor running in me, like if I don't let my friends know my each and every thought that they will forget about me or I will fall apart. Thus, I recently realized these (along with other things) probably lead me to living with high-functioning ADHD, and may explain why I have been so freaking anxious my whole life. Because of this chattiness, I have always given people the illusion that I am super outgoing and extraverted. I started noticing how great this felt to have people think this about me when I was in high school. I met a ton of new faces and quickly many people knew who I was, mostly because I would talk to everyone and actively try to befriend everyone. At the time, it was really freeing, given how small my school was that fed into my high school, as it was the first time in my life that I was being introduced to an entire new and expanded community of people. I was also in the closet and probably hated myself deep down, so it felt good to have other people tell me how great and popular I was, as I didn't actively think those things about myself. I think around here I made an association that having a lot of friends and being extraverted was the ideal, and that only through knowing more and more people can you meet the right people that will give you cool experiences, a great relationship, or even just funny stories. I didn't want to miss out on all of that, so I worked to make as many friends as I possibly could. Then, I went out-of-state for college and the same thing happened again. I think of being a college freshman and how excited I would be that over 400 people chose to like my Instagram post. It made me feel successful, like I was succeeding in life because 400 people actively chose to double tap on my photo and assert that they at least don't fucking hate me. It was really scary, however, moving to school and having to socially start over for the first time in my life. I would be so excited for breaks so I could go home and sit alone in my suburban house with my parents and just breathe and feel okay being alone. It felt like at school there was never a moment to catch my breath, as there was always pressure to go to another party, another extracurricular, another study session, another sexual hookup... ...but I was being told by everyone that I had so many friends and made THEM jealous. So, in my mind, it was worth it because \*it was working,\* I was now successful because I was adored by many. I know this sounds super pretentious but I'm trying to be as honest with myself about all of this as possible. I think my abilities to get people to like me or talk positively about me or whatever was filling the holes of inferiority I felt about myself deep down, growing up as a gay boy in the Midwest who felt very incompatible with the world. I never seemed to have success in the dating world, but it didn't matter, because at least I had a lot of (shallow) friendships. My senior year of college, I had this weird realization amidst a depression I was nursing as college was coming to an end. My closest friend at school had graduated and I felt super alone on campus even though it was my senior year. At this time, I realized that I had very little interest in partying or going out to bars and clubs, which was weird because I had FINALLY turned legal to do so. I felt super stressed in club environments with so many people and all the boring smalltalk I would feel inclined to have with the strangers around me. I wouldn't enjoy getting drunk as much anymore, and found myself spending more time alone smoking weed and making art. I'm not saying that isolating yourself and getting high nightly is always the way to go (as there are habits from this I am still working on to this day), but it was the first time in my life I would be content spending time alone, and I loved it. I felt so free to enjoy the music I wanted to enjoy, make and eat the food I wanted to eat, watch whatever TV or movies I wanted to watch, etc. And the idea of spending money to get drunk at a club with sweaty strangers, hoping that maaaaybe tonight I would meet the love of my life or my future BFF, just began to seem super exhausting and, frankly, unrealistic to me. Of course, I fought this, and judged myself super hard, telling myself I can't tap out of nightlife before I even graduate college. So I often forced myself to go out anyways and often found myself bored and incredibly self-conscious. All along, I've had one person from high school I would call my best friend. She lives across the country from me now but she means the world to me, and we talk most days on the phone. We went to different colleges but always stayed in touch. She and I were the same personality in high school and college, social and likable and most people (to my understanding) talked favorably about us and called us extraverts. Note: these are two independent statements because I don't think \*being an extravert\* is something worth idolizing as everyone is different, but at the time I definitely conflated the two to think that being an extravert was \*better\* for the reasons I listed above. She was in greek life and had a ton of friends, she is also beautiful so many other women envied or idolized her, guys reeeeeeally wanted to fuck her. She is super humble and would never say these things so I'll say it for her :) However, after college, we went two different ways in terms of how we socialize. We both moved to (different) big cities and lived smack-dab in the middle of them. I immediately felt the same insecurity about friendship I had when I moved to my undergrad, and started frantically trying to meet as many people as possible. I eventually found a few friends I liked, but they were also very extraverted so with them I continued to live a very extraverted lifestyle for the three years I have lived in this city with them. My friend from home, on the other hand, chose to hold onto her super close friendships from high school and college and not worry so much about making a ton of new friends in her new city. This was aided as she went to the city that many of her friends from undergrad moved to, but she didn't keep in touch with most of them anyways. She has consistently had \~3 friends in her city that she tries to see, sometimes going weeks without seeing them and not worrying about that, and has found a really beautiful relationship with a man who makes her really happy. She'll go out for happy hour from time to time but has stopped hard drinking and drugs in lieu of a more introverted lifestyle. When I tell her about MY social life in my city and how much it is stressing me out, she just doesn't understand why I'm forcing myself to do so much. To this day, I will frantically schedule my whole weekend starting Monday, hopefully filling it by Wednesday or Thursday. It'll be like Friday night drinks and dancing, Saturday brunch, park hangout, and then party at night, Sunday brunch and shopping with another friend and hopefully leaving the night open to deal with the Sunday Scaries. All these plans will be in my calendar by Thursday. Then, the weekend hits and I am so exhausted from the week that I want to cancel half the plans and chill by myself. In adulthood, I have started letting myself cancel things for my mental health, but frankly that is not nice to people who are trying to schedule their lives around me just to have me cancel plans last minute. I have felt guilty about that, but I feel even guiltier having no plans at all, because I'm worried I'm going to miss out on my life or whatever I can get from the serendipity of being at the right place at the right time out and about and not locked away in my apartment. I judge myself for needing time by myself, no matter how much time that may be, because I feel like I am disappointing my extraverted friends who cannot understand why I would need any time to myself. My best friend thinks that I am directly contributing to my anxiety by putting so much pressure on myself. But it's hard, because my whole life I have just been told I'm an extravert. I started taking the Myers-Briggs test in college and consistently got ENFP, but today I took it again and got INFP-T. And I'm sitting here wondering--what would the worst thing be if you had a smaller social life, with only people you really care about, and didn't feel such pressure to have the biggest most-popping social circle? What would it feel like to be content that you prefer spending time alone? Would that make me a recluse? A loser? Socially anxious? Agoraphobic? Or would that make me intuitive to my needs? Can I still find a man if I don't force myself to go to the club every Friday night? Reading over all of this, it just feels silly how much I am overthinking and intellectualizing this. For one, ADHD does that. But two, it is a whole confrontation with my identity. When I tell my friends I am an introvert they laugh and invalidate it, telling me that I don't understand the terminology but I must be the most extraverted person they've ever met. They'll bring up the amount of people I wave to on the street while I'm with them, but what they don't understand is that while I have those people to wave to, those friendships are shallow and limited to just waving at each other or exchanging smalltalk whenever we run into each other. They're not fulfilling relationships. I've held jobs in service positions where my role was to smalltalk with customers. But that's easy because it's shallow and repetitive smalltalk you can repeat with each person over and over. I get so anxious when I'm out and about and there's people around me because it takes so much energy to get the courage to approach them and I judge myself that I find it hard at all. Because an extravert wouldn't find that hard to talk to new people. So maybe, just maybe, I've been an introvert my whole life and been ashamed of it, thus overcompensating by oversocializing and focusing on HOW MANY friends I have rather than how deep those friendships are. I love my best friend from high school, but I can't be friends with hundreds of people and expect all those friendships to feel like that friendship. Nor would I want that because then it wouldn't be special. Has anyone had a similar experience of discovering they were introverted after a lifetime of being hypersocial?",0

I am absolutely terrified of finding a ""real job"" and just don't see that happening for me unless it's remote, but also because I still believe I can make my small business work. I also have a phobia of driving which may be hindering my quality of life because I never leave the house unless it's to go somewhere with my family or friends on the weekends. I am absolutely terrified of it and just don't have the best judgment when it comes to quick decision-making, so I avoid it. I tried for years to just get over my fear and even got my license, but I just can't do it. Because of this, it has created this huge insecurity of mine. I feel so embarrassed telling people I don't drive and feel like if I tried dating again, guys would be super turned off by it. And because I don't drive, I never really go anywhere or ever do things on my own, unless a friend or family member is with me. Sometimes I do think it would be nice to do things on my own, but SA makes that seem nearly impossible and I dont even know how I could when I don't drive.

pl8fyz,outside,"Does it sound like I’m going to have to be on antidepressants for the rest of my life. Advice please??. When I was 11 I was diagnosed with selective mutism / anxiety. I’m 22 now and have been on anti-depressants since I was 12. Originally the plan was to take them until I finished high school. There was a year out of highschool when my doctor thought I was doing well and let me taper off the antidepressant. I ended up having a terrible experience 5-6 months later in which I couldn’t talk like a normal person anymore - very slow speech, think or function properly so brain fog and constantly felt anxious, scared empty and depressed. My entire family was worried. It still scars me till today thinking back... So I ended up being sent to a psychiatrist for second opinions and being put back on it. Then feeling myself again months later. There was a point where my mother demanded the medication wasn’t working because all I do is sleep all day, and because I wanted to change doctors because I always thought my GP was a jerk, went and got me on a new antidepressant. I have been in a four month lockdown in my state and just sleep all day then awake all night. Sometimes I can’t sleep at all, for instance I’ve been awake for two days right now and assume it’s because of the novel I’m reading and so into at the moment. Which is weird because books should make you tired. Otherwise before this happened I was reading all night, then passed out all day. For me it’s normal because I’ve had sleep problems since I was young. One minute sleep is fine, next thing u know no sleep for a few days. Then it returns to normal sleep schedule. Whenever psychiatrist suggest something to help me sleep I decline it, internally I’m thinking IM NOT TAKING MEDICATION TO HELP ME SLEEP I told my mother this who had another one of her dramatic dialogues “OH MY GOD. the new medication is not working! You never take it at the same time everyday that is why. You have to tell that psychiatrist about this!” Which made me internally mad, made me think why does my mother believe in medication and psychiatrists so much?! Just like with the antidepressant, I don’t need medication to help me sleep?! Why can’t I have one of those parents who don’t believe in medication and refuse to put their daughter on drugs! I thought ‘i hate being on antidepressants’ over and over. I once had a mom friend who I told about these things, she told me she doesn’t believe in medication and wouldn’t put her kids on it, if it’s not doing anything for mewhat’s the point - she would prefer yoga and meditation. And to me that was the mother I wish my mom was right there. I don’t actually know if it’s helping, or what the difference is because I’ve been on medication since I was twelve. But def much better than as a child, couldn’t even say yes or no outside home back then. Otherwise I do feel much happier than when I had the antidepressant withdrawal depression that one year. My mother taking me to doctors at 22 makes me feel like a mentally ill person that can’t take care of themself, or a psychiatric mental hospital patient. My mother used to come to my door and force me to take my meds daily. Def mental patient feeling. So I demanded to take it myself, I’m an adult. Most of the time I end up speechless and have no idea what to tell my current psychiatrist. Kind of a selective mutism/social anxiety thing. But look how expressive I am ona blog! Crazy. As suggested, might as well write down my concerns to remember what to say. Otherwise I don’t really have any concerns. My mother pissed me off and makes me wonder if I could ever be medication free all over again. Aside from the venting, for the one hundredth time I wonder if I could ever be medication free. Because 1. It’s annoying to take everyday 2. Risk of liver damage 3. You can’t drink 4. It’s expensive. I hate it. I have been told by a psych that yes I will need to be on medication for the rest of my life, esp since I already know what it feels like to have a relapse. Sometimes I wonder if I could try going off my new social anxiety antidepressant (been on new one for 8-9 months now) And actually have a success story. Or is my brain so used to taking the serotonin and whatever chemicals are in them for all these years, that everytime I get off I would have terrible withdrawal symptoms again?",0

My heart sinks when I witness people become at all interested in one another. I don't have anything to say to anyone.

Even though she picked out that color. I recently stared taking two different anxiety medications just to deal with it. I felt so awkward the first day I took them at work.

Don't remember any fun activities. No theme parks, no arcades, no movie theaters, no sports events, etc... My friends always seem to be doing something with their parents. We were poor but so was everyone around me. I didn't go to a movie theater until I was 22. My dad always slept and watched tv and my mom was afraid of driving so she never had a car. The only time we went out was to get groceries and I usually stayed home. Also when I was a kid my teeth came out crooked. I was always insecure about my teeth. I never smiled or laughed because of it. I asked my parents for braces but they said it was a waste of money. I knew they could afford them but they were too cheap.

py0fk1,outside," SA sucks. But reflecting on past experiences with it- some moments can be quite comical from an outside view. Anyone have any funny stories to share?.. I work at a protein plant and one time I had a anxiety attack because I was cooking patties for people to taste test, and anxiety started building because I was too worried I wasn’t going to cook them good enough and that they’ll still be raw when I served them, so I kept cooking with anxiety rising until someone came into the kitchen - “what the hell is burning in here” with anxiety at its peak and reality altered making me think the now burnt patties were still quite raw, I had realized that not only had I made something inedible that needed to be taste tested, but I also smoked up the entire building😅 I set up a platter of the burnt patties pretending like they were ok, and then I left work early!- crazy how something so simple and easy can become so difficult. I left work after that because the poison of anxiety was too much I’m sure you can relate ",0
pzg2qm,outside,"Why do bad people with loud mouths easily make friends whereas people with SA struggle!?. I’m 25f, and I’ve always been annoyed with this. I had this one friend in high school up until first year of college who was a bully. She was nice one second and could be completely cruel the next. Would make childish remarks, and find them hilarious. And when I got to 17., I thought to myself why the heck am I hanging around her. For example, when we were with our friends. I’m was extremely quiet back then compared to now due to SA. And our friends went to go into the toilet. Only us were going to wait outside. She then looked over and said before they went in, “I’m not staying out here with you, you’re boring” and went into the toilets. Another was in high school when I went to the bathroom and came back to my friends and she said, “omg go away we don’t need you”. Surprisingly she still acts just as childish now as an adult. I have her on Snapchat, tho we do not communicate. She was out with friends calling a guy dic*head. And when he looked up said “omg I can’t believe he actually responded to that. That’s your name now” and laughed hysterically while he told her to f*** off. It gets me mad because I’m struggling to make friends and when I do, I struggle to keep them. I made a friend while volunteering and that friendships gone because I was too awkward to know when to end the outing and say goodbye, and she was too. My uni mates have all moved on from me whilst they still meet up all the time. I’ve never had a bf and have no clue how to go about doing that with no friends. Having no friends makes you look a bit weird to others, unfortunately, relationship wise. I just feel at a dead end where awful people seem to easily make friends whereas I am stuck with no one and I’m lonely as ever.

Sometimes I don’t wanna hang out with my mates because I feel I’m to weird and awkward around them, even worse when someone I don’t know is with them. The other night I was at a party with mates and there were heaps of people I didn’t know hanging out with us so I would make an excuse not to hang out with them everytime I had to. I would make up excuses such as I need to go to the toilet or I left something outside or in another room. I sometimes wonder if I ever will be in a relationship as I haven’t been in one since primary school which was basically for fun. I always feel useless whenever I mess something up. If someone tells me I’m doing a good job at something or try’s to be positive it just makes me want to cry because I never here that. Most things I do I constantly get judged for like getting a different haircut, or wearing clothes I think look good. I spend most my days just wanting to be alone in my room and eating food or just asleep most of the day.

q1hkdj,pool," I think it's possible to control anxiety. Even when we're anxious we are still in control of ourselves. Every step you take and every word you say is still your decision. You don't become dumb all of sudden. You can still think and act accordingly to the situation. We all know things that can makes us feel safer and calmer. If you're scared of crashing your car you drive slowly to make yourself feel better. If you're scared of drowning on a pool you just stay on the shallow side of it, or use a floater to make you feel safer. These are all conscious decisions you make. We can do the same in social situations. We can still find ways to interact with people without being scared the whole time. Take a deep breath when you're about to say something, use your best clothes, maybe go out with a friend. Whatever makes you feel more comfortable. You don't need to be a hostage. You're in control.

q1y0k0,"running, run"," Don't panic. Here's a tip for anxiety. I think one of the problems with anxiety is that some people panic at the first sign of it. Here's how your anxiety probably works : -Something triggers it. -Then you feel the symptoms. You start feeling warm. Your heart beats faster and you start to sweat. -Then you try to escape the situation as fast as you can to stop the anxiety. The last stage is where the problem is at. Trying to escape the situation is why you end up screwing things up. You shut your brain off and do everything in a hurry just so you can get it over with. Just like a child running from a horror house with her eyes closed. Here's something that helped me: When you feel the anxiety coming, instead of instantly panicking and trying to run, slow down, take a deep breath, give your brain some time to process and understand what's going on before doing anything. Most importantly, STAY PRESENT. Don't try to take your head somewhere else. Look at your monster (your trigger) right in the face, and think carefully and calmly about how to deal with it. Usually, a few seconds of this will be enough to stop the anxiety from building up (at least for me) and you can take this chance to think more clearly about what to do. ",0

I hate people. already had enough bad things going on in my life, i wonder why life loves to throw bad stuff at me. Today, i went on the bus to the supermarket (ones around my area suck) only to realize, i forget my card! Its already hard enough going to the supermarket for me, i feel uncomfortable in grocery stores, the people, the workers, its so stressful. When i was shopping, i noticed one stockperson just looking at me.....which immediately put me on guard and activated my fight or flight system as if they thought i looked weird, i chose to 'fight' gave him a look back and kept it moving. I passed by him again and again that same look, so i chose to 'flight' so i went the other direction. Very uncomfortable. I put all my stuff only to find out i forget my card at home! luckily the cashier was very nice and told me i could come back and bring my card to pick up the stuff i wanted. at first i said yes but after waiting ages for the bus i went back and changed my mind. The manager was nice and told me' hey it happens'. so i had to go the local supermarket where the cashiers are more bitchy. I was waiting in line only to find out i casually stepped in front of the line waiting without knowing there was a line, the customer who went to pay was just looking at me smugly, no one said anything to me! What is that??? but i just tried to ignore her, but still bitchy cashier ruins my mood. And once again the stock people in that supermarket were rude to me! I was getting a plastic bag to pick up some produce and had trouble getting it out, the stock person said something in a sarcastic tone, he could at least helped me! On top of it all, i was starving! So i was in a grouchy mode. To go back and forth was so stressful, especially having social anxiety and being highly alert of your environment, people passing by you, looking at you.

(and have never experienced sexual abuse/assault or anything like that.) but whenever anyone who is like a middle-aged/old man touches me, it makes me want to repeatedly scrub my skin over and over until but I’ll never be satisfied with it. Today my grandad was at my house, and my nana called me and asked if she could speak to my grandad (he doesn’t have a phone) so I put it on loud speaker and held it next to my grandad. But he took it off me and started holding it himself. I was really uncomfortable and overall disgusted with him holding it. As soon as the phone call ended, I took it back and ran upstairs where I thoroughly cleaned it but I’m still cringing a bit as I’m holding it right now. I was in the verge of tears that he had touched my phone. I haven’t let him touch me in years, so only the stars know how I’d react to that! Whoever my dad touches me, I feel like sobbing my eyes out and I just feel dirty. I have some teachers that touch me too, even if it’s just the shoulder or arm. It makes my skin crawl and I just want to crawl into a ball and change bodies. For my dad I, have reasons with the the touching thing, but everyone else is just random. A small amount of men I’ll be okay with, but most of them make me super uncomfortable. Idk what it is, even if they touch me/my stuff appropriately I freak out and feel like I’m about to have a panic attack. Idk, just concerned. I haven’t officially been diagnosed with social anxiety but I know it’s definitely there ever since I was a kid. My mum always says I’m “just shy” always has. But it’s more than that, it makes my life so much more difficult and my mum refuses to take me to get anything diagnosed. I’ve had many panic attacks before (mostly caused by my parents, or being touched) I once had one in the middle of year 8 pe when we were playing bench-ball. I was the last person on my team who wasn’t on the bench and everyone was yelling at me to throw the ball but I couldn’t as I’m weak and the people defending on the opposite team were all like 5’7+ and really good at defence. I couldn’t get any ball across and when my teacher finally laughed, that was when it started and I walked out of the gym and rushed to the disabled toilets to try and calm down on my own. That’s just one example, probably one that’s stuck with me a lot as it happened infront of other people and people called me sensitive, a wimp, lazy, etc. (Which didn’t help of course lmao) I just don’t know tbh.",0

I never complain to anyone about being single (even though it has me crying myself to sleep sometimes, amongst other issues) because I know they'll tell me ""it's your own fault, you don't put yourself out there.""

qi1gi6,running,"Hi everyone! New member here! :). Long read :( I'm an Asian 23F soon to be 24. A little back story, I've always been the shy, quiet, introverted, normal girl but that all changed junior year of high school after getting bullied for being the shy, quiet and introverted girl LOL. A group of kids just got a kick out of how I would react when being put on the spot and they realized if they stared at me long enough throughout class I would become flustered. I blushed easily so what was my solution to that? A LOT OF MAKE UP. I looked like an actual clown. I cringe about it to this day but in my 16 year old head I thought I would rather get made fun of for how much foundation I had than people seeing me turn into a tomato. So that's how my social anxiety happened. I didn't like attention, I didn't like eye contact, I didn't like interacting with anyone for fear of them judging me and witnessing an embarrassing sight. This lead me to overthink EVERYTHING. I resorted to safety behaviors which meant staying home most of the time but it got bit better when I was 19 years old. My aunt had this store that she needed help running and because she spoke very limited English she pulled my ass in to help. I thought it was a one week thing but I ended up staying there for 4 years. The first year was brutal but as the years went by these interactions came a lot easier. During this time I was able to get my first job as a barista/cashier and get my drivers license. Two things I never thought I would be able to do. I worked at a boba shop and it wasn't busy so it was easier to manage and the place was close by so driving there was also okay (I also have driving anxiety...). A year went by and I decided to quit and add to my resume after my cousin referred me to work as a front desk receptionist at an optometrist office. That was probably the worst decision of my life. The work environment was extremely toxic. The people that ran the office micromanaged everything, evaluated you on everything. Spoke condescendingly to you and made you feel incompetent...it was hell. I wanted to quite but for my cousin's sake, I didn't want to make him look bad. I was there for about 5 months when the pandemic happened. It was a blessing in disguise for me because it meant a break from all that. I was preparing myself to go back in after a few weeks but it spanned 5 months. I knew they would call me in eventually but thought of going back scared the absolute crap out of me. I eventually got the call and after two weeks of being there I put in my two weeks notice because just as I expected, I couldn't handle it. Before, I was able to put up a front and tell my self to stop being a little bitch and to do what I was told to do and leave. Not the best coping mechanism but it's what got me through. Now, I was now holding back tears in the break room and crying while driving home after every shift. I quit and I focused on school which was still all held online at the time. I couldn't even do an online presentation for one my classes because of how bad my anxiety got. It didn't even require me to turn on the camera, just audio and I couldn't do it. The pandemic that I thought was a blessing in disguise turned out to be the opposite. I feel like from 19-22 I made progress and now I'm back at where I started but this time older and more expectations and pressure from family and society now that I graduated. I also forgot to mention that I dropped two toxic friends along the way. I only have one friend now but we have our issues too. She's understanding and I share a lot with her but...I don't get that closeness like I did with the other two friends. It's weird. I feel alone and I want to make more friends but making friends as an adult is rough and it's even harder when you don't go out and think everyone hates you lol. I actually went to see a psychiatrist yesterday because it was getting a bit much for me. A lot of ruminating thoughts and a lot of questions like, ""How the hell am I expected to live a decent life if I can't do simple things like x, y, and z?"" Fear turned into anger and I really don't want to keep living like this anymore. I graduated and I need to get on with life. I need to either find a job or go back to school to pursue higher education. I haven't decided on either yet but the main thing holding me back is my social anxiety. My psychiatrist told me that exposure therapy is what I need to do. I need to embrace that rush I get and become conditioned to get use to doing things like driving, talking to people, doing things by myself, etc. I was also prescribed Lexapro, and propranolol. I haven't picked them up yet but he said that these are here to hopefully help kickstart my journey but everything else is willpower and motivation. I can't say I have any of that right now but sharing all of this does help a bit.. If you got through all that, thank you. If not, I understand because this is extremely long lol.

I used to be shy as a kid and would be a good child, play on my own, not bother anyone. If I made a mistake I would've been heavily blamed by my parents (when most of it was actually their fault). I don't remember much of kindergarten, but I do remember that the next experiences in my life will make me have only one friend at a time. One at first grade, then we moved, second was in the rest of elementary school, then I was alone for two years, then I met my good online friend of years, then no friends again, etc. With each one of the friends I made, it was always a very deep connection, so it was fulfilling. With my online friend I was totally 100% myself. I joked, I laughed, I was vulnerable, open, funny. I could talk about anything with them, there was no judgement. I got to know myself as my authentic self with them, and for that I'm truly grateful. I realised in my core inner nature I'm actually a super energetic person, and I have the potential to be friendly and outgoing. I even lean more into extrovertion. But I never knew how to open up that said ""potential"". I always knew that if people would have known me as I truly am, they might actually like me. But my anxiety told me otherwise, and so i was acting all reserved with people I'm uncomfortable with or are new all the time, even when I talked. It was never enough.

The lessons are so stressful, I cannot concentrate nor relax with that instructor next to me.

In the past it’s taken me hours sometimes to work up the nerve to call someone or call them back because I hate answering and it makes me feel crazy inside. I remember my parents screaming at me when I lived at home to just do it and that it’s not hard and how I’m making a mountain out of a molehill. And even when I did manage to do it, I’d be rocking back and forth, squeezing my eyes shut, or picking at my socks the whole time. I still don’t really understand why phone calls are so horrible for me; I’m somewhat comfortable (usually) talking with someone in person.

Carrying around a “too large cup”- i just think people are looking at me thinking “why does she need that much liquid” “wow her bladder is super full” and then people thinking about me peeing which is also embarrassing. Also the sound the ice makes moving around makes me feel obnoxious and like I’m annoying everyone. Manic energy. 6/10 Bowling - idk why it has the pressure of a valedictorian speech and a fashion week catwalk but I keep imagining how weird the back of my head looks. Always feel like my reputation is on the line and that somehow; me bowling well will stop me from ostracism and being the weakest link. Secretly hoping I look cool while feeling the uncoolest. I’m scared of bowling shoes and I won’t wear them which makes me look like an ass but also makes me more inclined to fall on my ass too. 8/10 Being seen looking into a mirror - bathrooms, clothing stores, shop windows, that tiny little bench mirror thing when you go shoe shopping…literally I have to somehow figure out how to buy lipstick without seeing my face in the compact mirror at ultra. If anyone catches me I’ll burst into flames. Pretty sure it’s why I’m addicted to online shopping so I can have some peace. God forbid I make eye contact with someone in a public restroom mirror while washing my hands. In fact, any public restroom mirror will destroy my self esteem from the bad lighting alone. 9/10 Taking off my shoes/putting my shoes on - few things are so casually vulnerable as the awkward wobbly crane pose I’ll put myself in to avoid having to sit on the ground or in a seat to put my shoes on in front of others. Somehow the crane pose is always worse but in the seconds before I assume it I think maybe this time it’ll be better. Always always trip and have to catch myself like 4 times. I start making awkward sound affects to cover/yet also accentuate my discomfort. Grab the doorknob for balance. Hit my elbow. Step on the back of the hosts heel so they lose their show. Suffering all around. 7/10 Sharing a song I enjoy - hearing the words “you be DJ” send a lighting stroke of dread down my spine. Finding the chord. Racing racing racing in your head trying to find the least risky option that isn’t too safe that your lame. Scroll scroll panic scroll. Ok.

qvllyf,riding," I've been so blinded by making progress that I haven't seen my actual progress. Today I remembered how it felt like to get high level anxiety. I thought I might be dragged to talk in front of a bunch of strangers and the mere thought of it made me so anxious I felt physically sick. I remembered in the past I used to get sick like this from thinking about talking in VC in groups online. And not to mention, I couldn't pathom talking to people irl, not even cashiers, talking on the phone terrified me, and even merely riding a bus scared me. Getting a single word out of my mouth scared me to death. Looking at me now, I noticed how far I've actually come, and that I've been neglecting this truth because I was so focused on not reaching my main goal yet(my main goal is making at least one friend on my own). I've actually come to a point where I CAN pathom talking to people irl, where I can actually make lasting conversations with people I barely know myself(even if for a few minutes), where I see a stranger and instead of feeling sick from fear I feel just a tiny bit of anxiety and excitement to try and talk to them, discovering I'm actually pretty dominant in small groups, and that even though my experiences weren't always positive I discovered so much about myself just from making those changes. I still didn't reach my end goal, but looking at me now doing all the things I dreaded doing in the past, makes me think about how far I could come in the future. More importantly, I kept constantly comparing my experience to other peoples, thinking to myself ""but they are themselves around people, and I'm not myself yet"" or ""but they are talkative and talk enthusiastically with every new person and make new friends and I don't do it yet"", but now that I've noticed my changes, I realised that the only person I should have been comparing myself to was me all along. Feeling true pride and joy from reaching those small milestones never occurred to me, and so i never gained any motivation and kept thinking lowly about myself, making myself miserable and feeling like a failure when in reality I was succeeding slowly even when I was failing. I even tried writing a ""social win"" list of things I've done, and I felt nothing about it, absolutely zero excitement or pride. But now, I feel this pride. And I realised how important it is to pride yourself for your wins. This is a way to gain confidance in your abilities, not only in your social abilities, but also in your ability to OVERCOME ANXIETY. So yeah, maybe I still haven't opened up to people, or showed my true self to people. Maybe I'm not perfect and maybe I haven't reached my end goal yet. Maybe I'm nothing like those cool social people with a ton of friends. Maybe I'm lonely right now. But it doesn't mean I am not going to get there eventually, and it doesn't mean that whatever I've done up until now was useless. The me of today is NOTHING like the me of the past. I'm feeling like celebrating that, honestly. Even with my current hardships, I decided to cut myself some slack and actually enjoy my progress. I hope it inspires some of you to do the same. ",0
qxnfwo,sea," Social Anxiety saved me and here’s why. (To set the stage, I’ve had SA slowly developing since I was in kindergarten or first grade. It went to an extreme shortly after covid began and put me on a journey that ended yesterday) Obviously, social anxiety fucking sucks. It is by far the hardest experience I’ve been through. (Experiences with love have been my other hardest experiences) So I’m going to explain it using a metaphor but really, it’s a way of thinking about all of this. Long ago a demon was placed inside of me. Unaware of this I went through life as anyone would. The demon slowly grew inside me, and at times would make its presence known but not often early on because it didn’t have much power yet. Over time it grew stronger, and by the time covid hit, it was full grown. The demon was ready to realize it’s only purpose in life. It launched its attack on me by grabbing me and throwing me into darkness. I did not know where I was, how I got there, or what to do. I was truly lost. Now if I could see, I would see a sea of puzzle pieces that extend beyond the horizon in every direction. I was tasked with putting this puzzle together. Well really more like I was forced to do this by the demon. Since I had no instructions it took me a long time to figure out my task. Took even longer to find the first two pieces that go together. I head to learn each piece, it’s shape, and I had to learn where to find pieces I need. This was long and arduous. There were multiple occasions it felt hopeless, and twice I almost gave up completely. I endured the hell I was going through and kept working on the puzzle shrouded by darkness. After an entire year, I had some pieces together and a little momentum but it still felt hopeless because I was so far from the end. I kept enduring. Never gave up. I knew that I could do it. Eventually I became skillful with this challenge. I started picking up momentum. The closer I got to the end, the easier it was to put the puzzle together. I got so good at it that I was able to see the puzzle pieces without using my eyes.I got to a point where it became evident that I will overcome this soon. I could sense the final stretch. The last few pieces went together in a matter of moments. Within a few minutes. Ah ok now where’d the last piece go… THERE IT IS! The puzzle was complete, and the puzzle, was me! Not just me, but my true self, my personality trait that I buried deeply inside of me at a young age because I was thought to believe that it was weakness-it was this that created the demon in the first place. The demon is social anxiety. The puzzle pieces were experiences I had to reflect on in order to learn myself to finish my puzzle The finished puzzle beautifully displayed my personality trait that I considered weakness and kept buried away: HSP: Highly sensitive person. You see, as a male with HSP, I always felt like I failed to be a man because of my sensitivity. The stigma America has sees a major flaw in a man that is sensitive. At a very young age I saw this trait as pure weakness so I buried it instead of dealing with it. Even worse, I happen to look physically tough and attractive (I wouldn’t include this if it wasn’t important to my story) so I used my appearance to hide my weakness behind. It was easy but increasingly became difficult with time. So I pretended to be strong man with no sensitivity so much so I believed it myself. I had social anxiety because I never dealt with my “weakness” and it grew out of control. Social anxiety melted my disguise away, my ego, and only left me with my weakness. This is the hell part of my social anxiety. My weakness was fully exposed and I became sensitive all the time and constantly anxious because everyone could see my weakness. Strong fears of rejection. But by being forced to have my weakness exposed I had to start learning about myself to find a way to get better. I had to learn it wasn’t weakness at all. Social anxiety ripped me open to let my sensitive side out. For the first time I feel whole. Now I can focus on healing Next I will focus on developing myself with my HSP trait. Btw part of the puzzle included: Burn out, depression, the way my parents raised me, sensitivity ",0
qz56iv,nature,"My experience with job hunting/interviewing with SA. I (22F) have had SA for as long as I can remember. I would choose to eat by myself in the library in high school. I dreaded attending birthday parties or dances. I never talked in class unless I absolutely had to. Because of my avoidant nature due to my social anxiety, I never developed my social skills to the point where I was comfortable being around other people besides family. In college, I worked a part time job where I didn't have to interact with anyone, which I absolutely loved. When I graduated May of this year, I was too comfortable in that job to look for another. My job was easy and low-stress, and I liked the down time I had to read and write on the job. It paid $12/hr so the only downside was that I wasn't able to save as much as I wanted. My family urged me to get a better paying job now that I had a degree, so a few months after graduating I began to apply for jobs related to my degree. A few days later, I got an email saying a company wanted to interview with me. I felt sick to my stomach once the excitement wore off. I had gotten comfortable not interacting with anyone due to Covid and the nature of my job, and the thought of an interview was almost too nerve-wracking to bear. To try to lessen my nerves, I practiced mock-interviews over and over by myself (I was too embarrassed to ask anyone to help me). When the day of the interview came, I was a nervous wreck. My hands were shaking and I was sweating all over. The interview itself went just as bad as I feared. Because I was so anxious, my mind went blank when I was asked a question, so my answers weren't well thought-out or cohesive at all. One question in particular caught me off guard and had me stuttering an answer that was literally gibberish. I said, ""Sorry, I'm a bit nervous"" right after, but I could tell the interviewers were put off by my lack of social skills. Needless to say, I didn't get the job. After the interview was over, I went home and cried. I re-lived every cringey thing I said every night before I was able to mostly block the memory from my mind. Around that same time, I had also applied for a new position at my current company, thinking the extra money would help while still looking for jobs related to my degree. After two painful interviews, the second one involving the CEO, my manager called me into his office and told me that the CEO had said I didn't have the ""skills necessary"" to do the job. I knew he was referring to my below average social skills. My manager told me this in the nicest way possible and thanked me for ""putting myself out there"", but the whole time I was listening I was fighting back tears because I was so mortified. At that point I gave up on applying. ""There will always be someone better than me,"" I told myself. ""There isn't any point."" The rejections had taken a huge toll on my mental health. I felt worthless and depressed. Even my current job was ruined because it made me feel like a failure who was too inept to work anywhere else. A month later when I had mostly blocked the traumatizing interviews from memory, I somehow found the courage to apply to a few more jobs. I landed another interview and it went a little better than before. I managed to answer all the questions more coherently. I wasn't as cringey, I thought. Maybe I had a shot. Nope. Rejected. Once again, I was crushed. This cycle repeated over and over again, until I didn't even feel excited or scared or even anxious when a company wanted to interview. I just felt numb. I was so used to rejection, I was anticipating it before the interview even started. I've always hated when people said things along the lines of, ""the more you put yourself out there, the easier it gets"". The beginning when you start is so shitty and soul-crushing it makes you never want to do it ever again. And if you somehow find the courage/motivation to try again, the process repeats itself in an agonizing cycle. Your mental health suffers. Your self-esteem is nonexistent. You begin to hate yourself and your anxiety and can't stop thinking about how unfair it is that you drew the short stick in life. But the people that said that were right. It does get easier. **But only when I reached the point where I felt numb inside did it get easier.** Because at that point I was so tired of rejection, of setting myself up to fail, that I didn't care about what the interviewers thought about me anymore. I focused on improving my own social skills. At one point, I even found the courage to make a joke during an interview, something I could have never done before. And as crazy as it sounds, eventually *I began to look forward to interviews*, because I could see my social skills improving with each one. In the end, I got a job offer, six months after graduating. Maybe someone out there is going through something similar. In any case, I hope this helps even one of you. I know the experience isn't the same for everyone, but I just wanted to share mine.",0

Also recently my family is about to move and it will be our first home of our own as a family because we have been renting home previously. I am now struggling as I have been offered two job opportunities at the moment. One is to work from home and only travel to company meeting in a big city (the same city as my second job) if it's necessary. The other one is in a big city, about 2 and a half to 3 hours driving distant from my home. Both jobs actually pay almost the same amount of money, because one pays less but you live and work at home. The other one pays a little bit higher, but the cost of living in the city is high and you have to rent a room. Eventually, I will have about the same amount of money left to spend. I'm actually scared to be living in a big city by myself and it just happens to be the time when my family and I are about to move. I don't really know what to do....

It’s just that i feel sometimes i’m too old for some activities , just can’t imagine myself in a ride or over expressing joy and emotions it’s not like me at all . I’m not afraid of going out or meeting new people it’s just that some activities i instantly decline due to its nature and i can’t fake it and bear living an uncomfortable situation . I had an argument with a friend lately that did not end up well , it was mostly about how i changed since i got my first job and all i do is work and work related , that i’m not fun anymore and enclosing myself to depression (Ha!) , Some people are rude for not respecting boundaries and difference .

I (21M) work for my mother (She is a self employed accountant, who does taxes for small businesses, and also teaches accounting for individuals occasionally) as an accountant, cause as you guessed, I don't think I can find a job on my own because of my social anxiety. Even if I find a job on my own, I have health issues that are incompatible with typical 9-5 schedule. I go to bathroom frequently, have herniated disks in my lower back, one of my ears can only hear for 40 %, also I have hemorrhoids(I know, like wut). And to top all, I just can't focus half of the time if I don't wanna do the work. She knows all about my physical health issues, that's why she is okay with me working for her. And because every job has its headache, working for my mother isn't that good. Of course I won't have to deal with other people too much, but whenever I make a mistake, she tells me off, and uses bad words and we argue (I understand this, because it might be her subconscious reaction, cause duh, her 21 y.o. adult son is a loser who still can't get his shit together). And the other reason maybe is because I make mistakes kinda a lot or she expects me to not make mistakes. Anyways, she says the bad words first, and then I reply with some against her. Because of that she tells me that I can speak back only to her and nobody else, cause she knows I'll just probably die of hunger on my own. I try to explain her I might have mental issues, but there is no mental health issues in 3rd world countries, so no. Today I fucked up again. And a similar argument happened. That I cannot talk to nobody, but can speak back only to her. Like what the fuck should I do? Sometimes I just wish I could run a successful YouTube channel, or make money by trading stocks or bitcoin or do crypto mining. But I've tried first two, which require luck, charisma and hard work and mining is super expensive to get started with. I can keep working for her, and tolerate this whole thing, and slowly start my own business, regardless of my social anxiety. That's at least my plan, but she just keeps bringing up the fact that I'm a loser who can't talk to nobody. Which in turn makes me more self conscious.

rdikfh,running,"I'm always struggling with the gene vs nurture question. I lost my dad to cancer when I was still young, so I could never ask him about his life experience, but I grew old enough while he was healthy to recognize that there is a lot of him in me. And he was... *Just like me*. Quiet, reserved. Over sensitive, panicked over minor raising of tension, comfort-driven, and slightly weird when it came to eye contact and such. I wasn't old before I experienced a feeling of emotional distance from him, when me as a happy child running over to him tell him ""look, look, I've drawn Spiderman"" or whatever, and he would seem... Distressed? You just couldn't get a read on how or why he acted as he did, but it felt like there was a lack of maturity, I would say, and as if he got these fits of sadness over minor hiccups. On the flip side he had a fun sense of humor and he was way more rational than my mom, so in judgmental things and academics he was way more *fair* in how he concluded things, and I often found myself siding the most with him about disagreements with my parents, not because he would take my side but he was a much less opinionated judge than my mom was, and would point out a better overview of the situation and then decide ""okay, we'll do this thing, because then he will agree to it"" instead of forcing me or telling me I have to. He was very good at actually understanding from a birds eye view what was what. But I do get stories from my grandparents about how he would just draw in his room and do nothing but draw, as a kid, and they could never get him away from that. In school he felt others were bullies and he hated his home town since he was a teenager. It all repeated. I felt bullied in the teenage years. I didn't vibe with the other people. I was a computer nerd who always wanted to use computers, and I do all the things he did with regards to shyness and distressful behavior around other people but I'm also comprehending enough of body language and emotional cues that I immediately know when someone else feel alienated or self conscious because of me. And I want to stop it but the anxiety in my brain is what causes it. I cannot be calm around other people. It should be such a rudimentary trait to do so, and only get anxious when you feel genuinely challenged, but I always feel challenged. There is *something*, that I'm borderline convinced is genetic, where the union with another human being causes a glitch in the system and fucks me up in my brain. And it's telling because since I was 5 years old when I entered social mode with another person I do remember getting these deeply uncomfortable feelings in my body. It I felt hurt and needed to cry I would hold it in and go away. I would never share emotion, I felt like I didn't connect with them. So I always have that frustration... Can this be unlearned or is it ACTUALLY physical on some level, that my brain isn't quite ordinary in terms of social interaction. I have been through psychiatric screenings for Aspergers but they all said ""that seems unlikely. You are the most normal person we have met who talks about that."" And I do have a mild ADD according to the same screening process, but I can't see where on ADD or ADHD that these inherent off-feelings should've come from. It has nothing to do with hyper- or hypo-activity or attention span. It solely has to do with how two humans connect with each other.",0
rdpaw2,horse," Looking Good + Still Being Afraid to Socialize = People Thinking You're Stuck-Up? Anyone Else?. maybe this sounds weird. but. being well-dressed and groomed in public boosts my self-esteem. but i'll still be shy and socially anxious, still keeping to myself. this results in others resenting me and thinking I'm stuck-up. the bitterness and raw hatred I've received from coworkers and strangers because of this misunderstanding, has frustrated me for so long. it's like people expect you to be this boisterous ""life of the party"" archetype if you put lots of effort into your apperance. but when they see you're not, they assume it must be because you think you're too good to talk to them. naively, i thought improving my looks would make me more likeable, but all it did was cause everyone to associate my shy behavior with arrogance. so the hate towards me only increased, which in turn worsened my social anxiety. the same happened whenever i would post selfies online. I've started dressing more shittily, neglecting my appearance not wearing accessories, due to my spirits being crushed. I'm too terrified of being seen as some douchebag on a high horse. feels like I can't even express self-love because bitter people who don't understand me think it's actually self-aggrandizment. ",0

ripfjc,outside,"Had an initial ""survey"" therapy session.....and I didn't even tell them what I wanted to tell :(. I finally decided to talk to a school counselor and I was scheduled for 30min session for the councellor to get to know my problems. It was a zoom session. I was anxious during the session lol. When the counselor asked me about me problems and what I meant by close friends. \[One of my issue was that I couldn't make close friends\]. I just made up some random answer about 'knowing their family'. I literally never had thought about it before and my brain made it up on the spot. The counselor finally said 'you seem fine but I can set up an appointment with a therapist if you want'. So I guess not all is lost but that'll be after new year :( My problem is I can't open up to people and am always worried about what others might think. I almost feel trapped inside my brain because I never tell anyone about my thoughts. It reaches the surface of my mouth but never outside it, because I am afraid of opening my mouth I guess. So today I got anxious and just made up a BS answer instead of taking time to think and say what I actually wanted. My heart was literally racing during the session. I should have expected this lol and should have been prepared ig. It's pretty poetic - go to a counselor to get help with Social Anxiety and not being able to get the point across because of said thing :( Sorry for the rant but I needed to say this to someone without looking like an idiot :(",0

I'm a 21 year old girl with trauma from my childhood, ptsd, anxiety and social anxiety, scarring embarrassing moments, eating disorder issues and can be socially awkward. Growing up I was made fun of, excluded, talked about, abused, beat and experienced some truly personal harsh situations I don't want to go into that has made me very sheltered, quiet, cut out everyone (only people I talk to are my brothers and used to also be my mom but she passed :/ so I have no one really. Honestly seeing couples walking around and seeing groups of friends or pairs walking by me I just get so sad, ashamed, like such a loner, a nobody because I don't have anyone and I've never been in a relationship and only been in toxic friendships where they only pretended to like me when I was naive and actually thought they were being nice. What makes it worse is sometimes I'll get ""looks"" from these people like ""why are you alone?"" of like they're judging me or think I'm ugly idk, I just start feeling very self consious and want to run and go home and cry. My mind starts getting clogged with negative and suicidal thoughts because I don't have a happy, social, love life.

I also because of the traumatic personal things that happened to me in the past, I am very closed off, like my personal space bubble has grown, I hate being touched, any personal contact, I don't like eye contact, everytime I try to pictute myself on a date, with a guy or anything I just start panicking, getting immense anxiety it just feels like a nightmare to me I can never do it!! If I were to go on a date I'd honestly just run out/away, I'm already a bit socially awkward as well so I wouldn't know what to do. I also have BIG trust issues because of my past, I can't trust anyone so being in a relationship is just not something I can see myself doing which is a shame because deep down I would like to have someone who cared about me but if I were to get hurt I'd honestly commit su*****. I just feel like I'm not good enough, I was always the quiet kid in the back of the class, I could never make friends and keep them, I was judged and ridiculed a lot by a lot of the popular girls, boys called me ugly, I had and still struggle with a eating disorder (mentally its killing me), my self esteem is just low.",0
rnf05d,"climb, mountain"," Social anxiety has ruined my life. I believe that social anxiety is one of the main roots of my depression. I’ve always had SA pretty much, since I was a kid. Back then it seemed to be my best quality, because it made me the “perfect” child at school. I was quiet, responsible, kind and also got good grades. It’s what I was known as: the best behaved kid, the calm one. However, I’ve learned the hard way that these things mean nothing in the real world. Severe social anxiety is only debilitating when you get older. As a young adult, I’m unable to function. I got more and more depressed and suicidal throughout my teenage years, and I was never really sure of what started it all. But now I’m pretty positive that SA is a big part of it. I’ve never been able to see myself have a future, or to want one at all. I feel like simply trying to exist in this world with my mental illnesses has traumatized me. I knew I wasn’t made for it, but forced it and it completely burned me out. And I barely even did adult things; most stuff I’ve never been able to do. I only tried to go to college against my will, and now I have nightmares about it all of the time, specifically the internships. I dropped out and have been locked in my room for half a year, with no will or energy to get out again. Sometimes I feel guilty that I’ve never had the will to get better, but realistically, why would I want to go back into this world? I feel like my thoughts make sense. Why would I even want to be in a world that isn’t made for me, where every little basic thing for me feels like climbing a whole fucking mountain? It’s like even if I did have a will to live, I wouldn’t be able to navigate this place. Surely some people similar to me have made it, but they must’ve had a motivation, a goal, something they loved about being here, a reason to try. but I don’t have one. I don’t, everything disgusts me. It’s all pointless and frustrating and pathetic. Nothing is worth getting out of bed or moving in the first place because I’m so depressed. I am truly, honestly, deeply discouraged. I’m sorry if this sounds very negative. I’m unable to view it another way. I just needed to vent and thought maybe, I don’t know, someone here could relate.

rntqf1,bench,"My experience/advice as someone with SA. Hello everyone, merry Christmas. FYI I do think at least some of this advice will help but these are just my personal opinions and everyone’s experience is different. I’ve struggled with SA since I was about 10 or so (19 now) and I’ve come a long way, I definitely don’t have it as bad as other but it has been extremely difficult and has affected my life in a drastic way. Fortunately I’ve made a lot of progress and still deal with it today but my SA generally doesn’t prevent me from living a normal life like it used to. I’ll now list some things that help me throughout my experience, hopefully you guys can try some and see if they work :) -exposure I’m sure no one wants to hear this as it’s extremely difficult to put yourself out there and be in uncomfortable situations, but imo it’s really the most important. The thing is tho it isn’t about going to your local bar and doing karaoke or public speaking. It’s progressive little steps you take, and as you do this you’ll slowly start to feel comfortable in ‘uncomfortable’ situations. Obviously you all are experiencing SA differently so there isn’t a bench mark but please try to get out of your comfort zone For me it was things like putting my mic on when playing games, or taking phone calls instead of texting. then I starting exposing myself to more ‘scary’ social situations and quickly realised that my thoughts were so irrational and these situations are not so scary. I still have a long way to go but this helps so much -positive self talk!!!!! I recently joined this sub and I see a lot of post about people being in embarrassing situations and obsessing over it, which I used to do and is a normal thing with SA. But you can rewire your thought process thought repetitive positive self talk. So for example you get in a situation and it’s awkward or embarrassing and after I can’t stop thinking about it. I would just tell myself things like “it’s not such a big deal” “they probably don’t care and much as I think (which is too true” etc etc. I do positive self talk after any stressful encounter and it’s helped a lot but you eventually start to believe it. Even saying to myself everyone “ your confident” “your strong” “you can do anything you put your mind to” help tremendously, please give it a go!! -what to do in social situations ( like a party’s or gathos) A thing I learned to do in social situations, especially when there’s a few people was to focus on things/people, what I mean is when your socially anxious you tend to kind of retreat into your own head and have all these intrusive thoughts (eg there all looking at me, they think I’m awkward eg) but all of this is internal and being in your own little bubble of anxiety, if you look up and pay attention to everyone there not analysing you or worried about what your doing, and try to engage with whatever activity y’all are doing (listening to music, playing a game, watching someone, listen to someone talking eg) and soon you’ll start to forgot about all these things you were worried about. -breathing/meditation I pretty new to these so I’m no expert, but even just practicing slow deep breaths and then doing so when I’m anxious helps a lot, please look into this That’s all, thanks for sticking around if you made it to here, good luck to everyone on there SA joinery and I wish you all a merry Christmas good speed. Also I know all to well the loneliness and isolation SA brings so please feel free to DM me if you want to chat about or talk about your experience of my experience with Social anxiety or whatever :), god speed everyone 😎",0

rwa3vy,run,"Need advice on how to help my best friend with his severe social anxiety. Hi, Im a 17M and my best friend (also 17M) has pretty severe social anxiety and I wanted to ask the people here how to help him best? Now to clarify, he has never been diagnosed with social anxiety, but I’d say it’s pretty obvious from talking to him, and watching him in social situations. Here are some of the challenges he has socially. 1. He’s very very very shy and doesn’t say much generally 2. He’s quite hesitant to go out anywhere, as he’s always worrying about stuff happening 3. He’s very self conscious and hates being the centre of attention 4. If he has to do public speaking, he will absolutely freak out and run 5. He can’t make eye contact at all, not even for a couple of seconds, he says it’s really uncomfortable and scary 6. When we hang out in public places he quite often complains it’s too loud which I don’t really get, but he seems to find a lot of places too loud to bare, and wants to leave 7. He’s really really awkward. I mean this in the nicest way humanly possible, but the word that best describes him is “dense”. He’s really really literal, takes everything seriously, and rarely picks up on social cues. 8. He has these weird panic attacks fairly often. Where he goes completely silent, gets quite upset and shaky, hyperventilates, and starts acting a bit differently. For example, one of these happened yesterday, and he started rocking backwards and forwards a little, and started fidgeting a lot with his fingers, while breathing pretty heavily and not saying anything. I don’t really know what goes on in his head during these panic attacks, he hates talking about them 9. When he does talk, he struggles to control the speed of his talking. He will quite often keep speeding up while talking, and end up talking so fast he loses a lot of fluency and becomes rather hard to understand. He will misspeak a lot, some of his words will blur together, and he stammers a little, before getting frustrated and then getting really upset and needing to take a minute to calm himself down (which he isn’t very good at doing!) 10. He pretty much doesn’t talk to someone he’s only just met, it takes him a pretty long time to get comfortable around them to talk more than just a mumbled “hi” 11. He absolutely hates physical contact. Touching his arm makes him recoil and squirm. 12. He’s very easily flustered, and blushes a lot. 13. He’s very very naive and innocent, so he quite often gets me to explain explicit jokes to him 14. He’s incapable of talking to girls. He completely freezes up and blushes. 15. He gets quite frustrated very easily, and also cries quite easily, like when he gets frustrated. 16. He is a very anxious person and worries a lot about really small things, and worst case scenarios, however unlikely. Sorry for the long post, I wanted to write down as much as I could think of, since I’d really like to help him, so I figured here was the best place to ask for advice! Thanks",0
s11dzj,run,"Is it just me or is it normal for people to be kind of mean to each other?. People are just mean to each other. There's a very normalized form of being mean that I keep noticing in my regular conversations with coworkers. I think I'm only really noticing it now bc I'm meeting new people for the first time in a while. People are just so judgmental of each other, like all the time. I think I might be hyperaware of it because I'm always constantly on edge about being teased or rejected or criticized in some way. I'm not one to criticize others for the dumb stuff they do and usually feel guilt for doing so unless I feel it's really warranted (usually because of arrogance or apathy). It's bc I can totally see myself doing any one of those dumb things. When I hear people around me tease others or criticize others, I really feel a pit in my stomach. And I want to push away. I think *If they saw me do those things, they would judge me too, right?* The result is that I'm finding now that I'll push a lot of people away because I'll see how they occasionally speak of others and fear them seeing me the same way. Nightmarishly, it feels like most people I meet or most people in my life are like this. I think it's normal for people to be somewhat judgmental of others. Sometimes I wonder if I'm just being naive? I don't want to hold everyone to this standard of being a 100% perfect unjudgmental person? I've been judgmental of others before when they didn't deserve it, no doubt. Am I just trying to find people that will be extremely safe because of my anxiety, not because I think there's something morally wrong about being critical of others? I can never be sure. I think the solution right now is to just start to operate more in line with my values, to not give in to the desire to take part in making fun of others or gossiping critically just so I can be part of a conversation. Like live true to how I wish to conduct myself so I feel at peace with me. But what if I'm being too harsh about what is just normal teasing? What if my brain is way oversimplifying the bad compared to all the good I've heard these people say? I actually can't tell! I can't trust my instinct because I'm run by anxiety! What if it's normal but my overactive anxiety brain sees it as mean? I really have no clarity on this at all.",0
3y7rva,running,"Self worth and anxiety. Hi guys. 25 (M) I am new here. I just had a question for ya Do you think anxiety is tied to you self worth? I have always felt if I was financially stable, independent form my parents (horrible relationship with dad extreme verbal abuse as a kid, not that good of relationship with family overall, also was teased a lot in school ). And if I was successful ( I have been before, which did wonders for my confidence while in college ) I felt that all my anxiety would just drift away and I would be alright. When I get nervous I start to sweat extremely bad in my face, and its super embarrassing. I know its all physiological and how I view my self, and how I think others are viewing me. When I turned 19 I first tired bettering my self. Started working out, got hobbies,writing,running,reading, (photography) which is my sort of my profession now. Staring to be more serious about life. I had even tried nofap for 2 months. And I wont lie doing all this gave me amazing confidence. I even sating dating a track star at my school! Thing were going great, but still something was amiss. I still had to call mom and dad for cash, still had to listen to there complain about money and fighting with them even through I was off at college. I got the sweats less, but still had them and still got panic attacks around people. Around 22 I ended up trying Xanax for a while which made everything perfect. Then I realized that this quick fix I could not use forever and I gave it up which sucked (withdraw). I really don't want to go back to it. It ended up controlling me I felt I needed all the time to keep up my ""persona"" 2015 has be the worst year of my life After breaking my leg, having my room mate move out (which ruined my credit) on top of that losing a ton of money for medical and surgery and physical therapy(had to sell most all my possessions) , running out of money for college, forcing me to move back with my parents for almost a year now(which as been hell for me been super depressed and such). Almost joining the army to get my life back on track sine that looked like the only window of hope. Then last month ended up winning a photo grant for 10k. Now in 1 in a half months when I get the cash I am going to travel abroad for 4/5 months see the world (got the travel bug last year) and get back to my life and pursuing my passion(writing and photography) and after my trip moving to LA with one of my best friends. Also back in school online atm till I move back to California to finish my degree. So ya things are looking really good right now! I really think getting my life back on track will cure my anxiety( this will be the fist time in my life I am a 100% independent, For some reason I feel like this is it. I will be cured ). Always when I gained something, (success,confidence,hobbies, sense of focus) my anxiety got less. Am I being to hopeful ? Please guys give me ya thoughts and stories!",1

4gpbsy,run,"You are not your inner critic.. Hey everyone. I wrote this a while ago to cope with some real life issues and stumbled upon it recently. I thought this sub might like it. There is an inner critic behind each thought and each word typed out in front of me. None of my writing has to make any sense to anyone but me, but it’s as if it’s in my nature to have it make sense for others as well. Words are just used to express feelings and thoughts that I have in order to relate to another individual with similar experiences. And so other people also have thoughts and feelings that they try to convey through their words, but I wonder how often those thoughts and feelings get mixed up or portrayed inaccurately when they’re trying to convey something. Maybe we all have difficulties expressing who we really are deep down. Our inner most self is rarely seen by others. If we can pull down the curtain for others to see our true self we will not hesitate to do it. There must be some circumstances in place to do so. First off you must trust in that other individual completely. If you can’t open yourself up to another person’s opinions then you will not be able to convey your inner most self to others. You must trust that you can handle whatever another person throws at you. Other people are unpredictable and that’s flawed… Other people are good deep down, but their thoughts and feelings can also be misconstrued like ours. We see the thoughts behind our actions, but rarely do we see others for their thoughts. Their actions are much more easily seen. Their actions are instantly seen and judged rather than pondered like they should be. Everyone is trying to deal with their own demons and we are no different. The struggles of humanity come from the same seed of despair. We are all struggling with the purpose of our existence. Some seek refuge in faith, while others escape to different worlds through books or video games. There are no surefire ways to live our lives in this world. We are all given this opportunity through the sheer coincidence that the universe has created for us. There is no tangible thing that will bring us the peace that we seek. That peace can be found within ourselves and through the bonds that we forge as we live on. The people around us are also suffering, so we might as well take solace in the idea that we are not alone in our suffering. Our scars may look different on the outside, but they all harbor the same feelings of sadness and despair. These feelings pave way to the love that exists only when we’re vulnerable with one another. It’s no secret that we won’t be on this earth forever. Why waste time judging others for their misdeeds or interests when you could be enjoying life? It’s a pity, really. We’re all so engrossed in ourselves that we rarely see others for who they really are. They’re all like me. They all have loved ones. They all would love to make a friend who they can spend time with. They all want something to believe in. As I’m typing this, other people are also living their lives in their own worlds. My world may be different from theirs, but each world is valid in its own right. I don’t need to fear the criticism of other people. That brain power can be spent on solving my problems, rather than exacerbating them. The biggest hurdle in my 20 years of being on this earth so far is challenging that inner critic that tells me what I should be. It tells me what I shouldn’t do more often than not. It tells me I’m not good enough to stand amongst my peers and be myself. That inner critic is as real as me, but it doesn’t have to be if I loosen its grip on me. When I run that inner critic comes out and realizes it has no power. It keeps saying “I can’t do it. I should just give up. I don’t like this pain.” After a while that voice realizes the futility in its words. Overcoming that voice in one area of life shows just how it can be achieved in all other areas. Persistent effort is the key to any positive change. It takes more than a few words of encouragement to get past this inner critic. It takes determination and it takes time. Nothing happens instantly. No real change can be done in a day. Habits form and within those habits are the key to a good life.",1

It makes sense because in a group, people can all share their own output and one person may be able share knowledge that no-one else knew. For example, I was having trouble understanding a concept for a quiz that I had last week, so i said, ""Fuck it"", and went to school early to study in the library and maybe ask for help. As I went to the library I saw a group of my classmates studying together for the exam. At first I was hesitant of approaching and asking for help, but I forced myself to do so because I realized that the pros of understanding the class material and challenging my social anxiety were greater than the cons of avoidance and not knowing anything on the quiz. So I went up to them and said, ""Hey guys. Do you understand how to do the problems because I am completely stuck."" Then it went on from there. After we did some of the problems, we conversed about a bunch of different topics and I actually enjoyed it. I think I still didn't do that well on the quiz but many people seemed to have trouble on the same questions as me. It would've been way worse if I didn't ask for help. One last thing I realized was that for the past few weeks, I've noticed that I dislike being at home alone all the time. Instead of skipping class or other outside events, I want to go. I wasn't like that before. I would always dread heading outside. I think it's getting better now though.

5i0sxd,"walk, running, jog","Reducing your Social Anxiety. I wanted to put this together to help as many people as possible that are trying to function with social anxiety, which as you already know, can be extremely hard. I also want to say that in no way, shape, or form have I defeated social anxiety. These are tips, advice, and helpful things that can and will improve your quality of life and diminish your social anxiety. Most of this comes from my own experiences and also from what people have said about their own experiences in reducing/overcoming social anxiety. These will not only improve your anxiety but also your life in general. Stop masturbating and stop watching porn(if you do): A big reason for a lot of people's social anxiety is masturbation and porn. I won't get into the specifics too much but a orgasm from porn triggers a neurotransmitter to go off in your brain in a very large amount called dopamine. Such a large amount and especially at a high rate(if you orgasm to porn a lot) can cause anxiety, depression, among other things. Stopping this alone can do so many things. Able to talk to girls better, more energy, and being relaxed in social situations are all benefits of stopping this. Also if you are addicted to porn and masturbation(which might be you) this may be harder then usual. For most people that are addicted, full benefits are usually seen about 90-110 days after stopping. This is the time is takes to rewire your brain. Also the time may vary depending on the severity of your addiction. Healthy diet: Stay away from sugars. To be a healthy person, doctors say we should only have 37g of sugars a day. To put that in perspective a regular pack of skittles has 46g of sugar. An excess amount of sugar also triggers the dopamine transmitter which as you know, can do bad things. Stay away from sugar as much as possible. It is not good for you in any way. Try going after healthier things which can have great effect on your mood and anxiety. Cold showers: Not only do cold showers build willpower, they also are proven to decrease depression and build testosterone, which can help your anxiety tons. Cold showers are also very refreshing and can provide you with much more energy. The next chance you get, take a cold shower(not a cool shower) and see how you feel afterwards. I honestly didn't know what to expect but when getting up for school or work, they can take the grogginess away and you'll feel much more capable of tackling the challenges the day presents. Limiting time spent on phone/TV: So much of us with social anxiety get caught into this lifestyle where we're always on our phones, games, TV. Don't get trapped into this lifestyle. Do activities and build hobbies that you will enjoy. Start reading a novel. Start playing a sport. Do something other then coming home from work or school everyday and going straight to the TV. Exposure to social interactions: Some of us hide away or avoid social interactions or things that give us anxiety. One of the best ways to become more comfortable and relaxed when in these social situations that you dread is by doing them. Build your confidence and experience in these situations. Greater anxiety in the present is less anxiety in the future. I'll tell you how I am currently doing some of these things. 1. My job: I got a job at Monkey Joes. If you don't know what that is, it's a inflatable place where kids and families can come to jump around and have birthday parties/gatherings. Part of my job is hosting parties. Which means in front of 16-60 people I have to host a party. Also this party is in somewhat a enclosed room where most of the time people are standing/sitting right next to eachother. I have to give out orders, make sure the mom and dad of the birthday boy/girl are satisfied, help with anything that needs to be done. Also I have to speak in front of all these people and let them know what to do. My first party, I was terrified. I've now down about 5-6 and guys, I can't even put into words the difference this has already had on me. This helped me in so many ways like being in big groups, walking into places(like classrooms) with a lot of people and so forth. It's amazing the difference something can make when all you have to do is just simply apply yourself. School: As much as I can, I try to ask questions, and start conversations. I've made so many friends this year that I wouldn't have imagined making a year ago. Try to ask questions and talk to people your interested in talking too. Join a Toastmasters club(when you are ready): A toastmasters club is a group of people who meet up and give speeches to each other to better their skills at public speaking. This is a great way to challenge yourself and anxiety. It's also a great way to become a better public speaker which is a good skill to have. Running/working out: Not only does this get you in better shape but running or working out can build testosterone and also release a lot of built up anxiety. As you know, testosterone is good for people with anxiety. It can build confidence. If I've had a stressful day or have a lot of anxiety, I'll go on a 30min-hour jog with music and feel tons better afterwards. Drugs: Stop smoking weed: I used to smoke weed a lot. I think it actually had to do something with causing my social anxiety. I stopped smoking weed and felt loads better in the future. THC is linked to causing social anxiety so watch out for that. Not only did this help my anxiety but I was also able to focus on my school and sports much more. My focus in the classroom was also improved. Meditation: I, personally, have not tried meditation before. As you've probably heard though, it can do some pretty good things. People have said it's worked wonders in their life. Look up good techniques and try them. Also, if you do meditate, feel free to comment on your techniques and some benefits meditation has. Be prepared: When in school, knowing what the class is about or what the discussion is about gives me way more confidence then if I don't know what anything is about and I'm clueless. I've found that when I'm actively doing my homework, studying for tests, and maintaining a high grade, I have less anxiety/more confidence in the class and also around my peers. Don't just do the work or get by with a D. Become actively engaged in what's being taught and you will find yourself very intrigued and applying yourself more. Limit Stress: Sometimes, life is very overwhelming. Try to get things done beforehand and create a schedule of events/things that need to be done. You already have anxiety as it is, don't stress yourself out even more with things that need to be done. Get things done ahead of time to where you feel you have an adequate amount of time to yourself. Respect yourself and value yourself. Don't cheat yourself by letting deadlines go back and slipping up on due dates. Your only digging a deeper hole for yourself. I hope this can help you and your anxiety.",1
5l9a79,"walk, sun","""She'd rather stay alone."". I am visiting a German host family I used to live with. I don't know why I thought three weeks would be an appropriate amount of time spent here. In retrospect, one day would have been plenty. Anyway today, the family are having two get-togethers. Right now (lunch), they have the mother's parents over. In total, there are six people: Father, Mother, Son, Brother of Mother, Mother of Mother, Father of Mother. Later (dinner) there will be some other people, I believe again there will be a total of six people who will stay for a second christmas and until New Year's. Anyway so as per usual, I'm alone in bed still. I've decided to spend the day doing positive things to keep my mood up as I usually get really depressed during celebrations, and I know tonight at midnight will be rough. So I'm writing on my journal now (while redditing), daydreaming about positive things, I will later continue to plan a project I'm doing, read a book I am absolutely in love with, eat the best food in the neighbourhood and stuff my face, go on a walk when the sun goes down and brace myself for midnight. But anyway as they were about to eat lunch, the father asks me ""Would you like to join us? It's totally okay if you say no."" and so I tell him ""I would rather be alone."" in my most apologetic voice. I know the Father and the Mother are used to my antics. I lived with them for a year, and barely saw them. They know I have social anxiety and have come to accept and respect it. I still feel bad whenever I decline spending time with them but six people, three of which I am not really used to? Too much. Arg I'm tearing up just thinking about it. Anyway. So as he leaves, he announces to the others ""She would rather be left alone!"" and then closes the kitchen/livingroom door. I feel so damn embarrassed and annoyed at myself. It's like I've actually failed them, and they're getting annoyed at me as well. Part of me wants to leave early because now it's just ridiculous. I've been here for 11 days and have spent the last four or so in bed all day, sneaking out to eat, shower or brush my teeth only when they're away or too busy/loud to hear me. I hate myself. I truly do right now.",1

So I looked into the mirror and it looked like I was sad and pissed or something like that. Here's an example of what looks like: I still have the problem and I've tried gently smiling but it hurts keeping my face like that and I end up having my mouth twitching trying to keep it up and that looked weird. And since I'm trying to get out (by taking swimming lessons) and make friends. I don't want to make anyone I meet uncomfortable with my statue like face piercing through their souls like I'm judge them or something like that. Any advice or anyone that can relate? ,1
79e4q8,"walk, outside","Story of me beating social anxiety!!. Warning: this is going to be a long post. Hello, I just joined this sub Reddit and created this account just for the sake of getting my social life back in control. Before i go any further i would love to talk about where i was 4 years ago. Since i was a kid i always wondered why i am I so weird. Why can't i do social stuff like everyone else, why am I always scared, why do i stutter when i have attention of a group of people. These questions always were in my head until when day i found out about social anxiety and finally i was like i have the answer. Now i can look for a solution to treat my social anxiety. I think i was like 16 when i found out about social anxiety, although i was in India at that time so didn't had much support for it plus basic teenage stuff was going on in life. Getting bullied, being ashamed of being skinny which hurt my self esteem really bad, not being able to express my feeling to the girl i liked. All of this made my anxiety worse and i started to avoid people. Move forward to the age of 19 i come to new York, i feel now my life is gonna change. Somehow magically being in new York will turn me into some confident social bird. But i was wrong, i started college and things aren't changing i am still anxious around people have low self esteem, don't have a gf, skinny sf plus i am developing depression now. On top of that my mindset is changing into a mindset of a victim, i always feel like i am being attacked by people. This goes on for few more years and somehow i survive. Now I am 21, fucked up. Social anxiety is so bad that i can't even get out of house. I fucked up my semester in college and gpa is all fucked up. All i do is play league of legends whole day and i am only eating like one meal a day. Plus i am broke af don't even have money for food. I had it enough i said i have to change myself and will have to take control over my life. I had this burning feeling inside my body which i couldn't get rid of. So i started to taking, i did the following: 1. For first month i practiced getting out of house. I would go carts thinking about how do i get out of house. But i committed to it sometimes i would just walk outside for a minute and comeback. 2. Second month started to take walk outside house. My goal was to take walk a in places with lots of people, which is easy to do since i live in nyc. While walking my goal was to observe my anxious thoughts and try not to react to it. I read this book called power of now, where i learned about this concept of observing your thoughts. 3. Next I got a job as a salesperson. Holy shit that was a nightmare i have no idea how i even survived that, it was just crazy i wasn't event able to talk yo customers. I wanted to avoid that but i had no choice. 4. In college my goal was to ask questions in class. It was awkward though but i had made up my mind. I am not going to live like this, i have to beat this social anxiety. Now fast forward to 2017, one of my best years in life man. 1.I crushed it this year, i started my ecommerce business for which i worked my ass off and now i am making decent money. I am also about to launch my own social media agency. Plus i am part to so many entrepreneurial communities on social media. 2. Last semester i had one class where i would i was the most social person. Everyone knew me, i would make jokes and stuff. 3. I joined gym and went from 115lb skinny dude to 140 lb guy although i haven't been going regularly to gym recently. 4. Went to tony Robbins event unleash the power within! It was really crazy crazy. I am really into self development and tony is one my favorite person i look upto. 5. I went on a trip. 6. I tried to pickup girls, lol. It's fun but it's scary at times. And more stuff which will only make this post longer. How did i do it? I really believe that what we focus on is what we become. So my whole life i focused on social anxiety but in last few years i have changed my focus from anxiety, depression to the person i want to become. I try to focus more on what my goal is and how can i achieve it. Also i feel you have to have a sense of like enough is enough. Frustration and anger have always been my fuel, they give me so much energy to push myself further and further. Do i get anxiety? Yes feel it everyday it's just matter of taking control over it. Decide if you want to give in to anxiety or you want to win over it. Also i recently read something cool about anxiety, instead of trying to call yourself being anxious call yourself as being excited as anxiety and excitement are similar emotions. So by doing this whole meaning changes. Although i haven't been doing things i used to do and getting kind of comfortable. Recently i started to stutter when asking questions in front of big group so i have start working on social skills again. Ask me anything guys. You want to message, do that. I will do anything to help you need any advice. I am here to grow and help others grow. Peace🙏",1

7tn3e6,jogging,Upcoming 21st birthday rant. How did you spend yours?. I turn 21 next month and for the longest my sister (because I have virtually no friends) has been bubbling with ideas on what to do. It’s her boyfriends birthday too and they’ve decided to celebrate both of ours at a bar. Now this bar is a very ‘involved’ one. It’s one of those “ hey table 2 number #_ come up and sing”- or some shit. They’re also inviting a shit load of strangers. Of the little friends I have I’m the first to be 21. Needless to say it’s been keeping me up recently and I’m having nightmares about it. For the longest I’ve been hinting about not wanting to go. And last night I finally broke it to her. I tried to be as serious as I could and went “Hey I don’t wanna celebrate my birthday doing anything.” And just like- explained to her that I’m not comfortable going there. She ended up laughing in my face and saying “you’re going.” And it just really pissed me off and we went back and forth. She eventually texted me apologizing and saying I don’t have to go. I know many people might go “you really need to get out of your comfort zone.” But it’s not that damn easy. I’d like to think I made great strides just last year. I regularly leave the house for shopping or to go jogging. I finally got a job. I even went alone to get my first piercing and it was great. But I just cannot do a fucking bar- not at this point in time. I don’t even like celebrating my birthday and never even imagined I’d like going to a bar. I don’t know the whole deal just pissed me off. More-so because at this point I feel like my family should understand I have issues and how much it affects me. But they honestly don’t and they don’t believe anything I say I have. I’m just wondering how long it’ll take for them to realize I’m not okay. Do I have to go “hey mom I’m not happy ever and I always feel like I’m gonna have a heart attack!” “hey mom I think about suicide a whole lot!” Anyways I just wanted to rant- how did everyone else spend their 21st birthday?,1

9atudo,bike,"Don't do this alot.. I'll Try to keep it short.. I'm 22 years old and I've been struggling with sa for most of my life.. Going through school/college, I found it difficult to interact with people. When I did; I would stutter, blush/sweat, Find it hard to keep eye contact and wish I never even spoke.. So I try to find a way to avoid talking people.. I haven't had a real life friend since 2011/12 and I don't go out of the house much either, When I do I only go out on my bike to keep fit and it helps when I feel depressed. After years of struggling with sa, I eventually made an appointment to talk to my doctor about it and told him that I had social anxiety and was wondering what he could do to help me.. he told me to speak to the college counsellor, I told her everything after a few sessions.. She told me from what I told her I have severe generalized social anxiety disorder and told me to go back to my doctor and ask for medication. I didn't make another appointment to see my doctor again because I found it too difficult and embarrassing the first time.. The only person I've spoke to in my family about it is my brother, That's because he has social anxiety himself but not as extreme as I have it..

bkns57,outside,"Blushing. Hello. I’m a 23 year old guy. I just joined this subreddit, and I’m looking for answers. I grew up extremely shy and extremely short. Shorter than everyone in class, even shorter than the girls. Somewhere along the lines (probably around 14/15 years old) I stopped being shy, and started being very social. At 18 I lost a lot of weight and became very good looking which helped a lot too. To this day I feel very confident, and I’m very good in social settings BUT I’ve developed a deep fear of blushing. It all started when a friend jokingly screamed “why are you blushing?!” In a crowded place randomly, and since that day I’ve had the fear of blushing. I function just fine outside because of wind and fresh air, also when it’s dark (in the club, movie theatre etc). But in a light and warm environment the fear intensifies, and I usually end up blushing BECAUSE I think so much about it. Is there anyone else here who experience the same thing? Any tips?",1
bmrze1,"outside, walk, basketball","How I Got Rid of my Social Anxiety (Not a Panacea, but things that helped me). First of all, I know this post is long, bear with me. I’m writing this post to be the message I wish I could’ve read 2 years ago. If I had understood then what I understand now, I could’ve saved myself so much pain, embarrassment, and loneliness. I hope his helps someone out there. Even if your experience is somewhat different, I guarantee there is something in what I’ve been through that might help make sense of it all. **TLDR**: I went from fully socially comfortable, surrounded by friends, outgoing and friendly, to depressed, thinking anxious thoughts all time, desperately uncomfortable around other people. At that point, I did everything I could to figure out what went wrong, and how I could fix this terrible problem. The two main factors in the development of my social anxiety were an addiction to my phone/computer/Netflix/Reddit/Youtube, and increasing isolation from other people. **How my Social Anxiety Developed** A little background about my life. When I was young, basically up until high school, I never had a problem with anxiety. I spent tons of time with my friends, perfectly fine social skills, played sports, no problems with depression or anything like that. I’m 22 years old now, just finished four years of college. I think kids growing up today are dealt a much harder hand than I had. Internet addiction and compulsive smartphone usage played a huge role in my becoming isolated, anxious and depressed, and I imagine there are lots of kids out there who are maybe going through something similar, but without the foundation of a normal social childhood/early years. I started to develop anxiety around other people in high school. I had friends in school, through classes and sports, but didn’t spend much time with them outside of school. At the end of the day I would usually go home and spend time on Reddit, Youtube, Netflix or watch pirated movies and TV shows. My family had some serious problems, so I didn’t like to spend time with them. I would just go into my room alone, and try and take my mind off my problems with entertainment. My family was pretty poor, so I’d be hungry often, not have a lot of energy, and just want to unwind in bed with my laptop. I spent a lot of time doing that, especially over the summers. I went off to college and everything turned around for me. I was lucky enough to live in a college dorm with some great, kind, wonderful people, and I became good friends with many of them. I made an active effort to spend time with my friends, and I had social interaction every day. It became so easy for me to spend time with people. I was the happiest I’d ever been, and figured I’d grown from my awkward high school days and I was cured. I didn’t realize it could ever be like that again. My senior year things became worse for me than they’d ever been. I’m not proud of how I responded to a difficult year, but I honestly did not understand what was wrong with me, or how to fix it. I was swamped with difficult classes on top of working 20hrs a week at a job I hated. I had a bad habit of procrastinating until the last minute, and it caught up with me. I became constantly sleep deprived, was close to broke all the time so I started barely eating, just trying to will my way through the work I had to get done. I started finding it incredibly difficult to focus on reading technical research articles, having to go back and reread paragraphs over and over again. I became terribly uncomfortable just answering questions in class. When I started missing assignments and classes, I avoided my friends so I wouldn’t have to explain. My mind started to become uncomfortable, even alone. I numbed the pain and constant anxiety by going on reddit, youtube, Netflix, mindlessly browsing looking for something to make me smile or laugh, just something bright in what became a daily experience of feeling depressed, sad, anxious, all the time. I would be on my phone or listening to music almost constantly. I would constantly be thinking about how I was missing work, letting down my family and friends. I didn’t want to open up to anyone. I was incredibly ashamed. I ended up failing two classes, attended my graduation since grades weren’t out yet, and just lied to family and friends. I told no one that I had failed, just held it inside. I moved back home with my parents, took an easy job where I figured I could take time to figure out what went wrong, and go back to finish my degree after a semester or two off. It’s been just about a year now since I failed, and I’m going back in the fall to finish. **Symptoms of Social Anxiety, How it Played Out in my Life** Once I moved back home, I took a job where I had infrequent social interaction, and I spent very little time with my family. Problems with social anxiety became worse than they had ever been. I would feel anxious when people walked up to me, I would feel anxious just doing something as simple as ordering coffee or walking through a grocery store. In conversations, I would try to make normal, comfortable eye contact, but lose track of what the other person was saying because my attention was on eye contact. I almost definitely came across as dumb or unfriendly. And that’s not me being too harsh on myself; I’ve spent most of my life friendly and pleasant to be around, I understand how I was coming across, I just couldn’t figure out how to be socially comfortable again. I was literally losing track of simple conversations, or my responses would become simple and short. This was very embarrassing for me. I became uncomfortable just being with other people, so I isolated myself more. Every day just kind of sucked, I was always worrying about how I came across to others, always worried in general. I became very depressed and lonely. Started smoking weed frequently, playing video games, watching movies, just looking for something good after a day of awkward interactions, of being judged, of feeling alone. Almost all of my friends from college lived far away, so I saw them very infrequently. **How I Got Rid of the Anxiety, Became Socially Comfortable Again** A big part of trying to get better was keeping track of how I was spending my time. I started writing an hour-by-hour log every day of what I was doing. Then at the end of the week, I’d review how the week had been, what areas I needed to focus on, what mistakes I kept making. At the end of the month, I’d do the same process. I started bringing a small notebook with me everywhere I went, and took down quick notes on any ideas or experiences that I wanted to be sure to remember later. I wrote in a journal, infrequently at first, then more regularly. I recommend doing something to keep track of life, it makes it easier to identify trends and progress. I stopped compulsively using my phone, and I cut back the time I was spending online, on reddit, watching youtube. All the time I would spend flicking my attention from link to link on reddit, always taking in content, never producing my own thoughts, was hurting my attention span. I found it harder to become engrossed in books and long form content than it was when I was younger. This was a real problem for me my senior year, and I am sure that my constant use of reddit and social media was a factor in my difficulty concentrating and getting work done. All that time on the internet was hurting my attention and putting my mind in an anxious state of staccato, quick thoughts. I am 100% sure that my overuse of the internet, reddit and youtube in particular, was having an adverse affect on my mind. It was taking the place of the natural human state of mind; longform, uninterrupted production and operation of thought. I started a habit of meditation every day. Essentially you sit quietly, and pay attention to sensations, emotions, and thoughts as they arise. I can’t overstate how important this has been to me. It is a peaceful 10 minutes at the start of the day, where I can relax, don’t have to worry about all the real problems that follow me around all day, and begin to understand the operation of my mind. I use the Waking Up app, highly recommend it, it is exceptionally well made. If you can’t afford the monthly subscription, like me, the creator Sam Harris offers a free yearly subscription, you just have to email the address in the app description, no questions asked. I started spending more time with people who I loved, who wouldn’t judge me. This is the most important part. I was always anxious to talk with people, because I wasn’t doing it very often. And when I did talk to people at work, they were strangers who didn’t know me, so if I came off as shifty or nervous they would pick up on that, and the interaction was often uncomfortable. My mind would then associate interaction with that unpleasant experience of being judged, of making people uncomfortable. Some of my good friends lived an hour or so away, but I knew I needed more social interaction, so I made the drive, over and over. After I spent an hour or so with my good friends, I started to feel relaxed, and was more able to get into the conversations, without thinking about eye contact, being self conscious about everything I said, etc. The key to feeling like my old social self was in large part this right here. SPEND MORE TIME WITH FRIENDS. I was lucky in that I had friends out there who loved me. I know some people don’t have anyone, and when you are awkward and anxious it is very hard to make those connections. Don’t give up. I started stretching and exercising every day. For me, anxiety and depression went hand in hand, and moving my body everyday had a huge impact on my depression. Obviously exercise alone won’t fix all your problems. For more information on depression I recommend the book “Lost Connections” by Johann Hari. It helped me a ton. Or for a quick runthrough of the book, listen to his interview on Joe Rogan or Sam Harris’ podcast. Exercise and stretching (look up beginner yoga routines on youtube to follow along with) helped me correct my posture. After going through four intense years of study, often sitting hunched over a desk, or looking down at my phone, or just lounging on the couch, living a sedentary lifestyle in general, my posture was becoming a serious problem. Mind and Body are fundamentally linked, so if you want to feel comfortable in mind, it helps to feel comfortable in your body. Start off slow if you need to, go for a short walk at least. Even on my worst days, getting out of the house and walking the dog helped a little. I started eating more healthy food. I switched to a regular diet of mostly eggs, meat, fish, vegetables, fruit. I figured stick to the foods that our species has evolved to consume. I’m not a nutrition expert, but eating like that, and getting enough to eat, meant I had a stable baseline of energy throughout the day, instead of being tired all the time. **Tips for Social Interaction** When I started spending more time with people, I was very rusty. I felt as if I had forgotten a bunch of the fundamentals. Here are a few things I find helpful to keep in mind. Eye Contact. I made so many mistakes when I was trying to get back to my normal social self, particularly around eye contact. Our species has evolved to convey and understand information through facial expressions and where we look. So it is important. Where you look says a lot. In general, when someone is talking to you, by looking at them you give the message “I am listening to you, I’m interested in what you’re saying, you are heard.” One mistake I was making was I would think “alright, be friendly, make eye contact”. But I would be so uncomfortable and unused to the experience, I would think about it too much, I would focus intensely on the eyes, and would be so focused on eye contact I wouldn’t even process what they said. So I’d give off a message that’s very off, too intense, and if I wasn’t listening to what was said I had to look away and kind of process after the fact. You basically want to get to a point where you aren’t thinking about eye contact. That’s only going to come from repeatedly going into social interactions, and eventually getting to aplace where it doesn’t make you uncomfortable, and you can just use your eyes to convey meaning. As a general rule, try and be relaxed, be friendly, and look at the person that’s talking to you. You don’t have to stare them down, just relax your gaze so you’re not pinpoint focused on only the eyes. You want your attention fully on what the person is saying to you, not on eye contact. You don’t have to force eye contact. If you aren’t too comfortable with it, that’s alright. As long as you pay full attention to what’s being said, you’re alright. If you come off a little shy because you’re not making a lot of eye contact, that’s ok. It gets easier the more time you spend with people. For an idea of where people generally look while in conversation, watch a youtube video of an interview with someone you respect or admire, and see what they do. Or just pay attention to how the people around you make eye contact. People tend to comfortably look at the other person while listening, and while speaking people tend to look away often while thinking, kind of checking in with their eyes every once in a while. There’s not one right way to do it, just do what is comfortable and effective for you. What to say. A lot of my anxiety around being with people was from not having much to talk about. Part of that was I was wasting so much time online, I really didn’t have many interests or recent experiences that were engaging to discuss. In any case, it’s always a good idea to try and talk in terms of the other person’s interests, if you want them to be engaged in the conversation. When you are just getting to know someone, ask questions about their life that you are curious about. Again, the more you do it the easier it gets. Ask about their life, what they do, what they like, what they dislike. Try and find out what they are really interested and passionate about. For example, if they keep bringing up Basketball, take note of that. Ask about their favorite team, did they play the sport in high school, whatever comes to mind. Or talk about whatever’s in the environment, or coming up at work or school. This post has gotten a bit too long, hope this helps someone out there, if you have any questions please post, I’ll respond when I can.",1
bn4clt,"run, outside","Im wasting my time. I just really need to vent this, my head is about to EXPLODE full of stress, but i just look at things and I worry why i cant be normal and cant dig myself out of loneliness. Just a heads up, its gonna be a long one if you are on mobile.  and#x200B; I wanna give some background, I live in the UK, sometimes I feel like this place is alien to me, even though for the 18 years ive been on this earth, ive lived here. I felt like i've never truly fitted with people, i dont think i'm an odd person, just my mental health is so poor, its comes off like that. Parents always called me a shy kid (I was quieter but i think i'm naturally a more chill person), I don't think that really helped my situation, because i wasn't suffering from it then, I remember still being able to be normal in public up until around the age of 13. I have faced a lot of bullying in my life, sometimes from my own family without them knowing it,up until the age of 16, maybe not to the extent of what other people have faced, but it seemed to affect me a lot more. I will say that anxiety does run in my family, so i believe it is partially down to genetics.  and#x200B; Right, I wanna cut deep into the bullying, I wanna start with my family, obviously i know families have a bit of it, its just natural, but I feel like they instilled fear into me for stuff that did not need it. For example, i still get anxiety from listening to certain types of music in my house incase someone hears it and says something about it, i remember one time, when i had my first phone (i had one before but my parents kept taking it off of me), there were music ringtones on there, i couldnt possibly remove them, they were system locked, my dad finds them one day on my phone, plays them and everyone in the house laughs at me. Or another example, which has hit me the hardest of them all, Social Media, they scared me into not getting, made me fear it cus i was too young for it, I might agree, but they made me avoid it like the plague, until 16, when I got facebook and Instagram finally (I had twitter at 13, buts its not really that kind of place, but I still cant bring myself to add my family on there let alone most people I know. In other forms of bullying, When i say i am not an odd person, well I definitely used to be, up until i started college, i was very weird, and was bullied to death in school, people would play 'punchies' on me just for fun, and well, me being a skinny kid, I couldnt really fight back with conviction. I admit, im an emotional guy, and that i ruined a lot of friendships for me, cus if one thing went wrong, id storm off, at least these days im able to battle off that emotion. I was made fun out of in every single way possible, and its beaten every single last ounce of confidence and self esteem I have had.  and#x200B; To put this into perspective, this is how bad my problems go to; I cant go outside without feeling a strong urge of anxiety, I cant add anyone on social media, even if I know them cus I dont trust anyone and im afraid they will also reject me, they have to add me, which of course, no one will because no one cares (honestly, i feel like i just really hate my area), so ive ended up with only like 30 friends on facebook, similar number on insta, I do have snap, but i think you dont really gotta add everyone on there, since its more of a private place. I feel really incompetent at doing anything by myself, i feel like i have to do stuff for a strong reason otherwise i flake. My anxiety out in public goes near panic attack levels, I wouldn't say i go to that, but I sometimes ill get a dry mouth and body just doesnt want to deal with the pressure, I also cant move my body normal unless i'm confident, which is a more weird quirk thats been given to me by social anxiety. I never had a girlfriend, never even had a first kiss, never even attempted to really chat up a girl, i feel like im gonna end up as one of those people who is in his mid 20s, and still in that situation. I dont even like people looking at my phone, I refuse to pull it out on public transport unless its pretty empty.  and#x200B; I feel so isolated all the time, my phone is constantly dry, I have tried some positive things, like meeting people online in various ways, a lot of those people I really like too. I've really tried to keep positive this week, but today its just went haywire, i woke up with a real big feeling of loneliness, i just felt the need to cry, I didn't know why, and now its just making me think about stuff too deeply.",1
cdcwc6,"outside, run","I'm lonely and worried about myself. Hello, I'm 19 and still live at home. I recently quit a retail job that was distressing me pretty badly. I haven't been social at a healthy level for a couple years now (since maybe 14 years) and even then, I only had the one friend I depended on way too much. I haven't been able to go outside much. The thought scares me because I feel like I would look suspicious doing anything. I feel guilty all the time for things I haven't done. I feel like people hate me as soon as they see me. Which it doesn't help that I'm overweight. And I want to go outside and exercise to lose weight. I'd love to be able to get to a place (physically and mentay) where I can run because I love it so, so much and it helps with my emotions but I can only do it for a few short bursts. And I find it very hard to talk to anyone I don't know. I feel like I come off as cold and rude. I'm not meaning to, I really try to be nice to people but I think my expressions and tone don't match my intentions because people close to me say I look and sound angry and mean. But with family and their friends, it's difficult to talk because anything I say they kind of just stare and me and don't really respond to what I'm saying they just go back to what they were talking about before. Like if I say anything everyone goes quiet and stares at me. Then they don't respond. It makes me feel so bad it hurts my stomach. Sorry if this isn't the right place for this. I guess I'm looking for advice on how to have a little more confidence? And see if anyone has these problems?",1

cvt5dv0,"walk, park"," Man I was just like that about a year ago. At some point I just got fed up with that ridiculous tension that I would put on myself. One day, and even still to this day I take a walk around my local park just with the intentions of saying hi, or smiling and giving a nod to everyone I pass. I still struggle doing that to people my age (particularly girls) but otherwise I've noticed a lot of progress! It's gotten sooo much easier the more I do it. It might seem like a baby step but at some point the steps grow on their own. ",1
cwanpks,"walk, park"," Something that I did early on in my journey to better myself was taking walks around my local park. My goal was to acknowledge every person I passed, at first I would start with eye contact and a nod with a smile, now I've moved on to actually saying hi to whoever I pass. I still struggle when it comes to people my age, but thanks to that practice I've had I was able to land a customer service job. ",1
cwavt6f,"walk, park"," I agree and disagree with you. Saying it won't help is wrong. I had SA that was so bad I wasn't able to look for work or go to school after high school. At some point i got so fed up with the way i was feeling and not doing anything about it that i just tried exposure therapy on my own. I started small like you should and just had the goal of saying hi to everyone i passed on my walks around my local park. From personal experience i can say that exposure therapy is probably the best thing you can do for yourself. I have a long way to go to I've also come a long way, all without professional help. I'm not saying i don't advise it, but i am saying you don't need it. Also going into you worst fear will surely fail, definitely take small steps and gradually grow over time. ",1
cwmqlp4,walk," I know the exact feeling. The first time I actively tried to make eye contact with a passer by on the street I physically felt my body resisting, like I'd decided to walk into the path of a moving car or something. But when nothing happened I instantly realised how normal it was and how capable I was of doing it. My advice would be to try things out on random strangers in passing as even if you mess up you know you'll never see that person again and whats more you get an endless amount of retries just by walking down the street. Treat it like a research experiment. Be willing to actively sacrifice your comfort zone for a few seconds just to see what happens. Then you can return to normal. ",1
cwqigd9,bike," Whilst I have a fairly active lifestyle now, I know how it feels to spend so much time indoors you think you're starting to forget how to do normal social things. My advice, get a bike. Go out for a ride at least once a day, just for fun or take a trip to the shops or something. It really helped me feel like I was active in society and you know it's keeping you fit so you don't feel like such a waste of space all the time. Plus the endorphins you get will help uplift your mood and temporarily increase your confidence. It's a great way to feel like you're doing something without really doing anything. ",1
cwt6svl,outside," Really awful if you truly wish you had people you could be around. Here's a start though: go somewhere, either outside or wherever alone.

I just try to keep myself focused on the future instead of my current situation. Take a walk, go get some food or coffee, just put yourself somewhere public and just keep yourself calm. Read a book, listen to music, do whatever you feel like. It's kind of weird, but just repeating to myself 'This is normal behavior' while sitting in public and drinking coffee really helps. 'Reach for cup, take sip, place cup down in secure place on table, take a breath, this is normal.' Fight the flight response.",1

ebtq21g,Fresh air,Me and my sis have social anxiety. Sometimes we go get coffee or food. We also go to yoga class which has a lot of people but you don't really have to talk to anyone becuase its a quiet setting and you can always hide in the back of the class. It also improves your mood I guess because you're around others and yoga helps you calm down. They actually have yoga therapy I figured out. We just.get fresh air or smoothies.

5173rf,"running, biking, running, bike"," I am here for you if you need it, but first could you read this brain vomit first?. I try to be a good person. I will help people out whenever I can. I love being there for people and being able to make their day better. I have some inner turmoil over whether or not I am actually a good person or if I just delude myself into thinking I am. I get worried that I only help people to make me seem like a better person to myself, to justify thinking that I am one. I try to be fair and kind to everyone, but what if I am only fooling myself? I have met people in my life that just seemed so fake. Yes, they seemed nice, but you could see through it as an act, that they were just humoring the situation. I am scared I am one of these people except everyone but me can see who I really am. I am basically friendless. I have one good friend who has an SO and a kid with another on the way, and then couple people that I meet to have drinks with. I am a mess about this. I try my best to be a good person, but if I were one, wouldn't I have people that cared about me like I do them? Anyone I reach out to ignores me. I can't figure out why. Am I obnoxious? Am I so boring? Do I really contribute nothing worthwhile enough to have people want me around? I like to learn things. I like discussion. I like to share nice things I think about people. I will admit when I am wrong. I try to make everyone have an enjoyable time doing whatever we are doing. I have really bad anxiety. Sometimes this doesn't allow me to be myself, so I seem really shut off/ bored/or boring. But it is only sometimes, and to make it worse it usually happens when someone does finally get back in touch with me after I asked to hangout. I think, ""Oh man, they want to hangout? No one wants to hang out with me. If they do they will just end up regretting it since everyone else does. Or, if it goes well I will just ruin the friendship another time."" I have gotten better at hiding it, I think, though. I think I am fun. I like who I am. I am always open to bettering myself. I wish people could just be honest in what they think of me. I have seen someone distancing themselves from me (it is a common enough occurrence) and have intentionally pried into their reasons as to why, full well knowing it would be a faux pas, only to get transparent pleasantries and excuses. Which is reasonable if I put someone that is trying not to be close to me in a intimate spot. I didn't care that I was vulnerable. I just want to fix myself. I have never cared to be popular, or be in the spotlight. The small moments I have been, it is nice, but it is not something I seek at all. I just want people I meet/know to walk away thinking I was nice to talk to. That they had a good time sharing my company. It would be even nicer if I could have taught them something, or them pleased after I told them they taught me something. As much as I want those things, I cannot allow myself not to be me, though. I am very honest. I will not lie about anything, and the times I am forced to (socially, for some situation I cannot explain otherwise) you can see through the discomfort on my face. I have been called blunt, but I try to be tactful at all times. This leads to me brushing people the wrong way sometimes. But I cannot think of a time where the people upset by this trait were people I cared for. As I said, I will willingly admit that I am wrong. I think it is really important for people to admit that they are. You cannot know everything. Not being able to admit you don't makes you fail as a human. People I remember writing me off as an asshole are people that don't share this sentiment. For nearly a year I have been depressed about this. I broke up with one of the best people that has ever been in my life because I felt I wasn't good enough/just would keep her down. I lost a group of friends when I started dating her because my ex was the out-going hub of the entire friend group. So, me being around made my ex sad (I am not sure of better word) and the times both my gf and I went to a gathering it made my ex very uncomfortable. So I stopped getting invites to things.. then I stopped getting responses when I would try to plan something. This made me depressed, that either my friends didn't like me, or they liked someone who they know treats people poorly better than me because she was more fun. For a couple months after that I tried reaching out to people and no one cared to talk to me. At this point it was hurting my relationship with my gf. I started to feel bad that I couldn't be the person she fell for. I was too depressed to be me. And the days I felt like myself I still would get pangs of chest pain because I knew that she should have someone that society felt contributed. (She convinced me to quit my terrible job because she thought that was what was destroying me. Which, it was, but not all like she thought. This was also good advice from her point of view because I had a LOT in savings from doing nothing but working at this job. So leaving to find a job to better my happiness was a good thing to do.) I was jobless and friendless and the fact that she wanted me, as twisted and sick as it is, made me I stop loving her. She deserved someone better, so I made that choice for her. I wanted to be better. I wanted to be someone she deserved. So I started trying to be a person. I went and got a real hairstyle (I use to just use clippers and do it myself.) I started running/biking again. (I have chronic hip pain from my old job, so it made me lose my favorite thing to do.) I got over my anxiety of going to a gym and signed up for one. I went an bought a new wardrobe because she always dressed so nice and I just wore running/work out attire. I enrolled in school, which is something I stopped when I went full-time at my job that had mandatory over time 2-3 hours a day. In school I started strong, I was ahead of everything, getting close with my professors and the head of the department so I could get connections for an internship. Then my anxiety hit me, hard. I couldn't finish my resume because I am a 25 year old with nothing worthwhile to say on paper. I lost the internship prospects, hurt my relations with my professors. That caused depression, my grades started to slip towards the end of the semester. My 4 A's fell to near F's and I was lucky enough to find some willpower thanks to a nice classmate I knew from an old job and rounded my grades to C's before the end. Even though things went well for awhile, it didn't matter. Nothing changed. No one cared. I ended things last November with her. I was motivated to better myself until April. I went to the Gym every other day, I ate healthy, I wasn't excited to be back in school, but I did it and took pride in doing so. But the pride in myself diminished to nothing. I still had no one to go have fun with. No one texted how I was doing. I even stopped getting likes/conversations on Tinder, which was my last resort for a quick pick me up. I am lonelier more than ever, and I have been without close people most of my life. I use to get on cams to flirt/make fleeting friends before. Or teach people English (which is something that brought me joy.) Now the only connection I feel with people throughout the day are the 5 or so upvotes I get on something. I use to be a lurker and only send messages when I saw people hurting or if they seemed like they were remarkable genuine people for something they said. I would just tell them I would be here to listen for the former case and that I appreciate them if it were the latter. I use to get conversations from those, but now nothing. It is as if the world is intentionally turning its back on me. Since April I have basically laid in bed. I still go run/bike and work out at home, but it is a fight with myself to do that. I browse reddit, read books, masturbate, play league, or just lay in bed and scream in my head about what is wrong with me. I don't know if anyone knows how truly unhappy I am. I don't know if they know about my situation and feel awkward/helpless about it, so they ignore it, or if I am really fooling people. I don't want to be a burden so I don't talk about anything. When my brother's girlfriend asked why I wasn't leaving for classes I told her I missed the deadline to enroll because I was depressed a friend of mine passed away. Really though, we were no longer friends because she was part of that old group. I would have loved to be friends with her. She was one of the very few people that genuinely seemed to be happy to see me the entire year. I was especially torn up about losing someone that I use to call friend, and one that genuinely seemed to care about me (she cared about everyone. She was an amazing person) but even had that horrible thing not happened, I wouldn't have gotten out of my bed. Why couldn't the world have taken me instead? I can't find any strength in myself. I don't know what to do. ",1

67qdas,stream," Vent about having a crush and various other incoherent sentences. So there is this girl I ""volunteer"" with, we see each other maybe once a day, hardly ever talk except for the occasional greetings. Anyways, I have a mad crush on her. I think so, anyways. I feel like there's no way I could know what love is if I've never been in a relationship with anyone. But that's beside the point. She's only the third, maybe second, not sure, person I have had a crush on even though I'm already 20 years of age. She is absolutely gorgeous and funny and smart and I really want to get to know her but as you might already guess, there's this gnarly thing called social anxiety. Now I think usually SA doesn't hit me particularly hard. I can go outside, I go to work everyday without feeling overly anxious, hell, I plan on going on vacation alone to a far away country soon. But the environment I get stupidly anxious in is when around ""peers"", people roughly my age. I feel like I don't fit in because I don't partake in the same activities as they do (like drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes or pot, ""socialising""), or because I simply don't consider myself interesting. I mean I've got a few hobbies like listening to music or travelling (well, usually it's mostly thinking about travelling, shit's expensive), but I feel like people might not care about those things enough, I don't know. Just as I am writing these passages (rewriting, over and over and over...) I realise how groundless my ""thoughts"" about this are. Of course one can have a great conversation (theoretically anyways, I seemingly can't, I feel like I'm shit at keeping conversations alive, probably due to lack of practice) with an absolute stranger about these topics, I mean why not? Many, many people travel, even more so people my age, and I can't imagine anyone who **doesn't** listen to music. Anyways, whenever I do end up in a conversation with others my age I end up just being in the background, listening to what they say, not contributing anything beyond laughing at their jokes. And if I don't already feel stupid during those situations, I **will** feel stupid afterwards because I'll think the others will think of me as weird, ""remember that guy, why didn't he say anything"", ""why does he laugh so weirdly"", ""why does he keep looking at the floor"". The few times I did manage to break out of my shell I ended up dwelling on what people would think of me nonetheless, or I feel like I embarrassed myself due to the shit I ended up saying. Which is why I end up keeping to myself most of the time, I'm afraid of the stupid stuff I would otherwise end up saying. I feel like I'm a nuisance to people, even when they invited me to gatherings, because they could obviously do without this weirdo in the background who giggles occasionally and is otherwise dead silent. (Note: I hate how my rants always end up like an convoluted stream of consciousness.) So on monday I had to do this small thing at work, she basically had to do the second shift. When she arrived, I greeted her and basically fled the scene. I wish I would have maybe stuck around and had a chat, although even to this day I honestly can't think of anyway I could have pulled it off without looking weird. On the second day she arrived and I sort of ended up asking her if she needed help, which she said yes to, so I did because I had plenty of time on my hands. We actually ended up joking around a bit, which I loved, but we were otherwise largely busy so no time for chit-chat. She wasn't there today but she actually wrote me a message (holy shit yes) asking if I wanted to help her out for the next two days too. Of course I said yes! There were situations before where I might have had an opportunity to get to know her more but I always blew them by overthinking things and being too shy. I'm afraid I'll blow this perhaps final chance with no one to blame but myself. I feel like there have been signs she might like-like me too, and othertimes I feel like she tolerates me at best. And the thing about her is, she seems to be shy at first too. Which I absolutely adore, however it hardly makes it easier for us to get to know eachother. Man, in situations like these I sometimes wish I could just go back to the apathetic depressed self from a few months ago instead of being this hopelessly lovesick and still-sometimes-sorta-depressed weirdo.

8v2smz,"mountain, biking, outside "," What should I do about my appearance and anxiety. I am 20 year old virgin male who has never been in a relationship, I'm not really sure if I am ugly but my brothers lightly drunk friend have said so and is the reason I have no success with women. This coupled with social anxiety has lead to me being isolated from my peers at uni and resulting in no social life. Overall I'm not fat by any means, I regularly go mountain biking and this has kept me in a really good physical condition. moreover, I have a good well paying job lined up as a civil engineer when I complete my last few semesters at uni. However, I am immensely afraid of leaving leaving university, as it is my only means of potential social interaction with girls. I know when I start working as a civil engineer I will be unable to socialize outside of work as I am terribly afraid of going out (bad experience at nightclub when previously mentioned brothers friend and some others essentially made me go to a nightclub, I just sat down on a stool for 3 hours feeling pathetic and useless than I ever have). Taking this into account I am fairly certain after uni I would have lost all chances of meeting a girl. Overall I am very concerned that I will simply die alone as a virgin, resulting in me feeling depressed and having almost daily suicidal thoughts (when I'm sitting in lectures alone as always I just think about ending my life and how to do it becauae life is too difficult and most likely will get much worse). I am not sure what to do, I have tried socializing but I stutter, I even help people with math and physics just so I can talk to them but nothing changes, everyone avoids me and I feel immensely isolated from the world , like I don't fit in (became very apparent at uni and nightclub) and should just die.

esgpoly,"lake, outside ", Hey man so after the lake we went to their house today and i actually had quite alot of fun. I was shy at first but turns out they like airsoft and video games which are things i like. People can gain different interests. I feel much more confident talking to people my age outside of school. Thanks so much! ,1
dhoteuf,walk, Work on your diet and fasted cardio is the best way to lose weight. Wake up early in morning eat nothing and run a mile and drink water. Later in the day do more fasted cardio before dinner. Do that everyday+great diet you will lose your weight. You'll have to lose the water weight first then you'll see a decrease of body fat overall and don't worry about the scale worry about consistency. If you can run a mile work up to it start walking. You can also lose a lot of weight from gym and lifting weights but cardio is better but since your in this subreddit da gym is scary. I know a lot about fitness I'm just turned 17 a go to a small gym that just opened :D nobody goes lol Any other question I can try to help I can also give you some recourses if you want I'll just have to find them ,1

My good online friends (3) all live in a house together so it was cool to visit them all at once. They live in vegas so they showed me around and there was a lot to do. The whole reason for the visit was to go snowboarding for 2 days up at Mount Charleston. Was SUPER fun. The drive to vegas was 6 hours there then 6 back.. 12 HOURS ALONE haha. Few months later they visited me in San Diego and we went around town and what not; beach, food, etc A year later i re-visited them and we went and skateboarded at a bunch of different skate parks and went around las vegas. Another fun trip. I'm a bit closer to one of them so he came down to SD for a Greenday concert adn we had dennys. To sum it up it wasnt awkward meeting at first. Its really no different than online",1

g3yo7mo,"ocean, outside , wildlife , outside "," The aquarium building is closed for now so they set up displays outside. It's right by the ocean so it was really nice being outside the whole time. Anyway as far as animal fields, I guess that depends on if you want to do something like animal husbandry (with pets, farm animals, or wild animals) or be involved with a more wildlife restoration or management side. Not many places are open for volunteers right now, I just got lucky finding the aquarium by me that was. But otherwise I'd be trying to do stuff like trail cleanups. Not sure but there might be animal sanctuaries or shelters who need volunteers. I think I found the aquarium through volunteermatch. They weren't having volunteers for a bit but they kept my app on file, they only just recently reopened as an outside only thing. A great resouce for career stuff in the wildlife biology field is Kristina Lynn on youtube, she made me realize that that's my true dream job. She keeps it real and does ""day in my life as a wildlife biologist"" kind of videos too which is helpful to see what the job is actually like. Highly recommend her videos. :) ",1
o40zfa,"camping, beach, hiking, swimming, camping, beach,  camp, beach"," Anyone Have Seemingly Random Moments Free From Social Anxiety?. I'm very socially anxious and introverted; I generally don't interact with people or try to make friends, etc. I'll give you an example of one such instance where I seemed to magically change. I went camping by myself at a site near a beach. I enjoyed being by myself, hiking out and swimming, etc. But I was feeling slightly lonely. Two girls who were camping near me came down to the beach and like a total coward I just kept my distance and didn't say anything to them. I barely greeted them when they said ""Hi"" as I passed their camp. I was pretty brief and shy with any other campers I came across as well. Later, I decided to start making a beach fire, when another guy my age came up and asked to help and started talking and joking with me. I was kind of shocked since nobody ever just approaches me in a friendly manner like that. We built a huge fire together and hung out the rest of the night drinking and talking about deep stuff like we had been good friends for a while. Maybe it was the fact that he approached me (I don't think I would've approached him) but it was so out of character for me to be so talkative and friendly with a complete stranger. Nothing like it has happened since. I wish I could recreate that scenario in my daily life and be friendly and gregarious with everyone, but the majority of the time, I'm so far from that state mentally. ",1
k820y7,barbecue," Hey, stupid. Get out of your head!. For real. Spending so much time *thinking* and being inside my own head is probably the biggest reason i have social anxiety. I'm training myself to stop this. And it's actually not that hard. Get your head up. Have a look around you. Pay attention to the people, the things, the smell and the sounds of the world you're in. It can help you see things for what they really are. I was in a family barbecue today, and instead of worrying about what to do or what to say, i just enjoyed the hell out of it. ",1
mjiv5b,bicycle," Got so fucking lonely that i ended up going outside. People say that if they gave in to their anxiety they would never go out again. Well, today i learned that that ain't true. After days without leaving my place and seeing other people, i just reached my limit today. I started feeling desperate for human contact. I went out, visited some relatives of mine, rode my bicycle around the neighborhood and it felt great, even though i was still anxious. If i had friends to hang out with i would totally go to a bar today. ",1
e2tyj2c,Go for a walk,"Relax, always remember to breathe. It's very, very, very unlikely that things will be as bad as you think. Try reading a book, listening to music or whatever it is you like doing to relax, maybe go for a walk. Exercise tends to help clear the mind. Also, make sure to eat right and sleep enough. Your mental state is closely linked to your physical health, so if you don't take care of yourself you're only going to feel worse. Lack of sleep especially can really make you oversensitive. ",1
ey0wuie,Go for a walk,"If you think it's because you're not used to the situation, then the obvious thing to do would be to go for it anyway and try to get used to the environment. (Easier said than done, of course.) You don't have to go all out immediately, of course, but maybe doing smaller, low pressure things with a friend could help you acclimatize better. Go for a walk, run errands, play a game at home or wherever you're comfortable, that sort of thing. nnI would also recommend looking up a few breathing exercises, as focusing on something else can often help with nervousness. You could also try telling someone you trust about your problem, so they can help you calm down when you feel nervous or nauseated again. You might be having overstimulation/hypersensitivity issues, so taking an occasional breather while out being social might be all you need. nnThat said, I'm no professional. If this keeps up, you'll want to see a therapist or similar who's better suited to help you overcome anxiety. You can't just keep avoiding people forever, after all. Well, you could, but that's no way to live.",1

g7uszkh," walk,  waves"," Dude this ENTIRE post is what I am going through. I’m like...going crazy is silence because of this and I cried yesterday because I felt like I was trapped in my body and can’t escape this hell of feeling worthless, stupid, disabled and (my own personal dilemma “ugly as hell”) and though I do not think you are disabled I can totally understand how you FEEL disabled. It hurts a lot for me and I can imagine for you too, so know you’re not the only one and I am going through it too. People, including my momma, told me these struggles such as memory/focusing/“feeling dumb” is a symptom associated with anxiety, the anxiety is so severe it interferes with our ability to focus. It’s not that we don’t have the ability, the anxiety is just blocking our mental capabilities out. So we’re smart and strong mentally, we just struggle with the anxiety and depression aspect. My mom has advised me to read, work out, do things that improve cognition and focus, and to do what it takes to not allow anxiety to get in the way of that. Which dude I know it’s so much easier said than done. I hate that I do badly want to connect, so badly want to talk to people, so badly need others but I don’t know how to approach them, how to verbalize what I want to express to others, and I’m scared that they’ll judge me because I lack some education I guess and don’t have an opinion on so many topics. Even if I was educated I feel like I don’t relate to half the people who talk ghetto or are, like, idk how to explain it but basically modern youth personalities and interests...I used to but now that I’m so insecure and feel like I’m not pretty enough to care and I don’t know how to connect at that. That may sounds stupid as hell but it comes down to the truth:(. I was going for a walk trying to stop crying but I felt like I couldn’t even handle my surroundings where people were walking out of their cars, houses and there would be a chance someone waves at me or tries to talk to me...even though I’d love to I’m too insecure. I hope there’s a way we can get better, I have more faith in you and know it is possible for you I just don’t know about me. :( ",3
96zjny,"swimming,  pool, swim, swim, outside ,  walk, swimming,  pool, swimming, swimming, swimming,  pool, outside , swimming"," Crushed by SA. I'm 18, M. I will be starting uni in 3-4 weeks. In arts. I feel like I'm going to fail and I feel like I have no future. Sometimes I'm enthusiastic about it though. But most of the time I feel like shit. I was afraid of people of my school even after 3 years, so guess I'll feel great surrounded with people I don't even know (spoiler : I will not); not to mention that the uni is in the capital so I will have to take the transports everyday, with crowds full of people in a hurry... It's the first time in my life that I won't be able to return home to feel safe between classes. I do know a friend who will be in my class though, but in our group of 5 friends I was always left out : I'd see them going out to bowling, McDonald's, or simply hanging out together, always without me. Guess I'll stick to her unless she gets rid of me for better people who aren't awkward and lame like me. Can't really blame her for that, I'm getting used to it anyway. I'm spending all of my holidays in bed doing nothing. I'm too scared to call the doctor to get an appointment. I don't even have a desk so I can't practise anything. None of my ""friends"" are down to go out to do anything with me. I want to go out, I want to go outside. I want to wake up early, take the bus for the capital, go through the shops even if I don't have a lot to spend, maybe buy a cute thing or eat a burger, or just walk in the streets and laugh. But I have no one to do this with. I'm terrified of going through the shops alone. I'm scared of people outside. I'm afraid that if I go alone to buy something like the cute cat watch I saw last time I went to this shop, people will make fun of me or will tell me I was dumb for buying it (""that's some stupid shit..."", ""you can find better and cheaper stuff on the internet...""). So I don't go alone. What's the point of it anyway? I want to go to the swimming pool and swim all day. I'd like to get there and not care about anything around me, just swim in my own bubble (pun kinda intended) all day long, and when I get home I'll be exhausted, but the good kind of exhausted, not the today-I-did-nothing-but-laying-in-my-bed kind. I'd like to think that if I manage to step outside and start walking there, everything would go fine by itself then; but even if I did get through it and reach the swimming pool, I'd be too worried about the people around me to enjoy being there. I'd be awkwardly swimming, worrying about what the others think of me (even if I don't think anything about other people swimming and I know they don't think anything of me, I know it but I still can't proceed like a fucking normal human being), not to mention I hate my skinny body thanks to nearly every fucking person in my life mocking me for it. In the end, even if I did reach the swimming pool, I'm sure I'll get out after 30 min and just walk home crying. It's always like this anyway, whenever I actually want to do something, I have no one to do it with and I just chicken out because I literally can't go alone, I just can't. This, or either I just simply fuck it up. And then I get even more scared of the outside world for the next time I have to go outside. I remember when I was trying to fight SA with ""small victories"" like buying X thing to the grocery store. I don't quite know when it fought back but it doesn't matter, I just eventually lost to it. Again. And it's crushing me, and it's ruining my holidays. On the bright side, I have an amazing boyfriend who's very supportive and knows how it feels, so maybe when we move in together in a few weeks, I'll be able to go swimming with him. But that will be the beginning of our first year of uni, so I don't know if I'll have the time/energy/motivation. In the end it doesn't matter since he's at his grandparents', and I miss him terribly, and he's not there so I feel trapped in my room. I feel like I'm such an annoyance when I talk to him about it, even if I know he doesn't feels this way, and I'm too scared to reach out to my other friends. So here I am, hopelessly posting here without any goal. I'm sincerely sorry for having made you read this random shuffle of panicked thoughts and I sincerely wish all of you an amazing day/night as well as much courage against SA. ",3

If I was honest I would say how I hate warm weather, the sun drains me, I'd rather be inside playing video games, but that would make things awkward I think 😂 I hate being ""fake"" but I feel like in a professional environment a lot of times I try to fit in more with everyone else, just to be safe.

I was solo backpacking Nepal for 2.5 weeks, most of the first week was spent trying to seclude myself, often to the point of missing meals to avoid interacting with other backpackers. During my hikes I would be alone for hours at a time, yet any peace I seeked was short-lived, and would be lost to self-defeating thoughts. I would surrounded by the most beautiful scenery, yet I would feel nothing except loneliness. Eventually, the solitude was too much, and I had to go back to the city to recuperate, at which point I noticed that every interaction I had with another was like resurfacing for air, each time get easier and more natural to do so. After being home for only a week, my social improvement has become apparent. It can get better.",3
6j5pyx,"beach, outside "," I dont know whats wrong with me and its making me horribly depressed. Ive changed a lot in the past 6 months (r/nofap, r/pornfree) but now that school is out im having a hard time hanging out with friends. Its been 2+ weeks and all ive done is stay home and play xbox. I only plat for a few hours, so when im not playing im either working out or watching netflix. Any time my mom invites me and the family to go to the beach, i decline, because i feel weird about never socializing with friends and only going outside to hang out with my family. Ive also realized i dont really have much in common with my friends. One half of my group smokes weed, (which is all ive ever done with them, im sure they do other things.), and one half makes music and all i ever see them do (through social media) is practice their music. I want to initiate something, but i dont know what to do since i dont have any interests, really. I thought this was social anxiety, but i seriously think im either super depressed but just feeling bored, or maybe im fucking autistic. I would go to a psychologist, but my mom would make me drive myself and ill fucking panic. Last time i went, i told him i was ""fine, and my mom just sent me here for some reason"" and ended up getting nothing out of it. Then theres the financial issue. Im 18 now so im pretty sure shed make me pay for any medication myself, and she keeps pusbing me to get a job, but every time ive gotten a call back, i pussied out. I think i should pursue the interviews, but if i actually go and do it, ill be like ""wtf am i doing here, im out of place"". Shes mentioned me paying rent, and i think i have like a little over a week to get a job. Even as i type this, i cant fully express what my actual problems are, and im the same way in real life. If i were to go to a psychologist, id start talking about my problems and then once i see them looking at me id stop and say that im fine, since i feel weird being weak. I know this is already long and i dont even know what im trying to say anymore, im just totally fucked up in life and i have no real direction.

4spxsc,"swimming, beach, swimming"," Making friends as a loner. Just quick facts about me. Closeted gay guy, social anxiety, depression, loner. So I see this guy semi regularly. Maybe once a week and have/had a little little tiny crush on him. Every once in a while we'd have a little conversation. Maybe walking the same direction for a bit. Him liking women came up organically(just mentioned he thought a woman was hot). That and some tiny things makes me pretty sure he doesn't like guys. So I guess this means move on. I don't want a relationship anyway. I'm too screwed up. Too asocial and have no hopes and dreams, lazy as hell and unwilling to do anything to change it. So I guess him not liking guys is a good thing. Anyway. Post is about friendships mainly so here it is. He told me I should call him on the weekend so maybe we could do something like go swimming and gave me his number. When things are happening my brain kind of forgets to send the anxiety and depression signals (although it absolutely does send some but I feel like I don't have time to dwell on it as much in the moment). So up until I got his number I did want it. I guess it was partially because there was still a chance he might like guys and my brain just wanted more time with him cus I was or am kinda crushing on the guy. But as soon as I got it that meant decisions. That meant over thinking every little detail like crazy. That meant I have to make a decision to call or not this weekend. I hate having stuff to do in the future. If you say let's go to the beach right now I may say fuck it let's go. But if I have to make the decision by Friday I will most likely (90%+) spend days anxious and second guessing any decision i make going back and forth between yes and no meanwhile knowing it's gonna end up at no. Cus no is easier. Removes future decisions and decision/social anxiety. Life is just.. simpler alone. I'm so lazy. I read some definitions of loner and yea.. how I feel. . Someone that likes being alone . The type of guy who dosen't have good social skills, No confidence and jealous traits. . Known as 'the boring guy', the 'friendless' guy, the invisible man. Being socially anxious and withdrawn I have little to no social skills. Sometimes I think I don't even care. Like I can't connect with people. Just want to be alone. In groups I may as well not be there. I barely say a word. I'm also stupid. Don't know anything about the country or even damnit city I've lived all my 24 years in. So I don't want to talk partially out of fear I'll say something stupid or wrong. I used to have 3 friends. One best friend the other two I didn't hang out solo with much. Mainly we all 3 hung out together. That was in like 8th grade. Then I moved. I hung out with my best friend still every now and then. Then never. I haven't talked to him in years. I now have 0 friends. That's not an exaggeration. I have no people I hang out with at any time in real life. I'm in a kik group where I've known 4 or 5 people for close to a year but that's it. And a friend from the same country on Skype that I do nothing else with but watch TV shows. Also go swimming? I'm a lil chubby and have stretch marks and self conscious. Don't know if I want to hang around half naked with better looking people including that guy - the possible new friend. Anything that requires any effort is like.. nah easier to do nothing. I would be okay with doing nothing for the rest of my life. It would get boring at times but it beats feeling like shit. Anxiety and depression and maintaining relationships. I'd rather just not have any obligations. Not have to act somewhat normal. Just be alone. I'm fine with how social I am online. I meet my needs. Online relationships are .. here comes that word again.. easier. No having to look and react (body language, facial expressions) and I can just close the app or whatever whenever I want. And it's way less of an obligation(hey at least I'm consistent). It's anywhere from 1 minute to hours depending on what I feel like. Actually doing something is hour or so before to get ready and you can't do anything else cus you have to go in an hour or two. It's possibly hours of doing stuff. Feeling akward. Then get home. It's a whole day versus 20 minutes. The eternal struggle. I ranted a lot huh. Also since I only have his number (he doesn't have mine) I'll be the one who has to initiate contact. Or just do nothing. Which im 99% sure is going to happen. ",3

ghxhdz,playground," Any other mom’s with social anxiety? How does it affect your day to day life with your kid(s)?. For me, my social anxiety has led to depression. Or maybe depression has led to social anxiety? I have days when I can handle more social situations than others. Other days I feel like a kid, hiding behind objects so people don’t see me. I’m *always* literally ALWAYS thinking about how others perceive me. Whenever I talk to someone, my immediate thought is “I wonder what they think of me?” I have issues with my body image too. My confidence level is incredibly low. I can barely look at myself in the mirror or in pictures because I find it makes everything worse. I already have super low self esteem as it is and seeing a picture of myself drops it down another level. So, I just don’t take pictures. If I do, they’re deleted right away. Having a 4 year old son on top of all of this is ridiculously hard. I feel bad for my kid most days because I just barely have the strength to play with him (depression) and the thought of doing things with people gives me anxiety (social anxiety). I’ve sucked it up a few times just so he could have a moment to play at the playground. When that happens, I’m usually forced to talk to other moms and it’s hard. So hard. Putting myself in those situations for my kid is hard. But especially hard for a mom with social anxiety. My son gets bored frequently. Some days he has too much screen time. It’s harder right now because of quarantine, but even in normal life we don’t get out much. I literally have NO friends. All I have is my son and my boyfriend, whom I’m thankful for, but even my boyfriend doesn’t have much of a social life himself. I feel like ghosts. Like, we as a family don’t exist. We’re invisible to a lot of people. Isolated. Nobody asks to see us except family from time to time. We don’t share too much on social media which keeps us in the dark even more. I stopped sharing on social media when I realized it was causing more harm to my anxiety and even my confidence. I went through a phase when sharing pictures of myself online was the only way I got a “confidence boost” and quickly realized it was eating away at my confidence more. So I stopped. People wonder about us because we’re so quiet. Even in high school I was a loner. Now, at 25, nothing’s really changed. At times, I can force myself to be OK in social situations and people probably would never know I was anxious - the only hint would be that I’m less outgoing than the group. I stay quiet unless I feel the need to say something. Talking exhausts me. Between depression, social anxiety, body dysmorphia, motherhood, etc I often feel very, very worthless. I hate feeling so down about life and myself, but I’ve kind of learned to keep going even when I do feel this way. It’s like, I don’t really know how to feel any different. I’m just at a loss with myself and who I am. I struggle to find my identity. I don’t know how people perceive me because I don’t know how to perceive myself. ",3

It was just a reminder of how lonely I am. Usually when I go out somewhere I feel better. My SA/depression gets caught in a vicious cycle during extended periods of solitude where it feeds off itself, getting stronger and stronger everyday. But today, I broke that cycle and went out to run some errands, because I had to (seriously--I ran out of food). At first it was a reality check and a breath of fresh air. But then something HAD to come along and make me feel like shit again. Standing in the checkout line at the grocery store, I see this couple ahead of me. A guy, maybe my age, maybe a year or two older. Dressed kind of like me, except he wears it so much better. He even kind of looks like me, except better, and unlike me, he's physically fit. Then this really cute girl runs up and joins him in line. Like, really hot. She's all up next to him, talking close to him, and she clearly likes being with him.

I became her back up bridesmaid after another dropped out (I didn't really want to, but feared saying no). Well she decided in July she wants to have a whole bridal party weekend getaway, this involves her, her fiance, her six bridesmaids (including myself), his six groomsmen, five SO of members of the bridal party and all their children. Just the idea has put me in full blown fear. My boyfriend said he would come with me, but now had to cancel due to work. I don't know any of these people, no less want to spend a weekend in a cabin with them all by myself. A part of me wants to suck it up and be there for her, but we all know how anxiety works. I don't want to have a breakdown around them. I also don't want to spend three hundred dollars on a trip I'm going to dread. It's just all of them are rather close, where I feel like I'm more default and will be on the outside. I feel selfish. Now my friend is angry at me and reconsidering me being in her wedding party. Apparently she needs people who are involved and willing to suck up their issues - I've explained my anxiety to her and the reply is always, learn how to deal with it. Any advice? ",3

This time every year I find myself getting so depressed because I want to have fun and do summer things, but I'm completely alone and have no one to do anything with. I find myself cooped up inside most of the time and even when I go to the beach by myself I still find myself sad. It definitely hurts when I see other people my age outside having fun and making memories with people. Anyone else in the same boat? How do you deal with the summertime blues? ",3
ixf77k,"soccer, tennis, basketball, soccer"," Could it be that i never noticed i had social anxiety, or is it just a temporary phase that'll go away once i figure what i want to do in life career wize?. i've never been a huge social person, but i've always had my 3-4 group of friends at each school i went to. i think primary school was the only place i didn't have friends for one year, but even then, i never felt like i cared. i didn't like group project but i didn't mind them because i usually did them with a friend, and while i was of course nervous in front of people, i didn't feel overwhelmed. i also didn't feel overwhelmed when i had to present something at the board by myself, i didn't like it but i forced myself and it went okay you know. i never spoke up in class unless needed. all my teachers said it, ""too calm"" ""doesn't participate"" but because i don't talk unless i have something to say. &amp;#x200B; i never knew what i wanted to do career wise, never. but i also didn't ask myself much. i made jokes and appeared chill, which alot of people told me. it was the whole vibe i gave, and i felt like it too, meaning i didn't feel stressed or anxious much. only time i felt somewhat stressed were for first days of schools, when i moved somewhere else, nervously hoping i would make friend, that i wouldn't get lost, but it feels like it's just common stress you know. After high school, i went to uni because all my friends did and i was good in english so i figured why not. ended up not being my thing. i failed. that's not when the stress started. i then applied to psychology at uni and to a PA course. i didn't even know it was for PA but the diploma seemed pretty basic and quick (2 years), so i went for this one, even though i had psychology in the back of my head for years, because i got scared of how long psychology was. i got scared i wouldn't be good at it. i got scared i wouldn't get good grades. i had to do 3 short interships for the PA course, and i felt anxious through all of them but i managed. i hate calling and answering phone calls but i had to do it for most of my interships and i managed. mostly because i could pass them to employees who knew the answers to the questions asked. but i wasn't very social, and i've been told so. i didn't really go out of my way to talk to the employees. when i finished the PA course and got my diploma. i realized along the way it wasn't my thing either. i don't want to be a PA. and that's when the stress started. i got a small part time job because i know myself and, having not worked alot, i knew i had to go slowly. i did. but it was a job at a pizza place and it also made me realize i have no freaking idea what i want to do. and EVEN if i did, i'm so freaked out now, having spent so much time at home with my mind, that i would be scared as hell to go for it. &amp;#x200B; my dog died after my diploma, and he was my best friend, i know everyone says this, but as someone who didn't have REAL friends beside one who stayed, he really was. i was 7 when we adopted him, he died when i was 23. he was my shadow in a funny way, wouldn't leave my side, and i don't know if this is related. i never kept much contact with all the people i met in schools, only one friend or so. and i don't know if the way i've felt scared of the future, scared of jobs, scared of everything, came because of my dog's death as a way to mourn, or if it's deeper than that. i don't know if it's covid, because i don't feel like i feel anxious about covid, living in a small village, but then maybe i don't see how anxious it makes me. and i don't know if it's just not knowing what i want to do in life. or if it's all of them. i should be focusing on my driving license but yet i can't. it goes to the point where i cry at night quietly so my sister don't hear through the wall. my heart races fast most of the time, my feet fidget most of the time, i'm constantly thinking about career, career, career. but i'm incapable, or i feel so at least, of doing anything. i feel like i'm scared of going out of my comfort zone, of meeting people, of going outside, of having responsabilities when i feel SO immature. i don't want a job, but i have to no? i remember having a fear of my parents dying at something like 11 years old. but it passed and i got over it, yet right now it's back again but it's worse because i'm older and they're older and i haven't figured shit out yet. When my mom took me to soccer, tennis, basketball and all that; i had no problem with it. but now that i had the idea of starting soccer again, i felt so scared and anxious of calling by myself like an adult that i just didn't do it? i wanted to learn piano recently, never called. i got so anxious when i got phone calls for jobs, or for interviews, i literally had to write what i was gonna say on my phone? i never cared about phones calls younger, so why? when i started the PA course, i didn't freak out THIS much at the aspect of going to a new school in a place i knew nothing about, so why didn't i go for psychology this year because i got scared of going back to school again? it's just so frustrating. i guess i'm posting again here, because i don't know who else to tell. what if i'm just making up those feelings all in my head? what if i'm just being a crybaby when so many people have it worse. i know we shouldn't compare, but i feel like ""what if i'm overexagerating my feelings and i'm not actually anxious/nervous but i made it all up in my head and convinced myself i was while some people actually suffer from it?"" i FEEL anxious, i FEEL incapable or having responsabilities, immature, i feel scared. but am i? i don't know, i don't wanna bother anyone.

df5bs2b,"run, walk","If your mom gets mad at you for trying to talk about your problems I'd try and take a different approach to telling her. The best thing you can do is try and stay calm even if she gets mad at you. Try and approach her when she's in a good mood. You can even do something for her (such as making her coffee) to try and create a good atmosphere before you talk to her. Do your best to open up to her as much as you can. I don't know anything about you, but a few years ago I'd never have imagined telling my mum about my problems in detail. Maybe you feel this way too, maybe it seems impossible, but once it's done it is worth it. Go into detail and tell her how you feel about it. If she has empathy she will listen and try to understand your point of view.  Now i know everybodys gonna say your still young its normal for you to be like this... As someone a few years older than you, I found out around your age that everyone has their own problems they deal with. I didn't believe it at the time; it took me a while to realise it but everyone has their own unique problems and their confidence is all an act.  while potheads, sex addicts and bullies and all this shit get to live the fun, free life without worry of what tbey do next The majority of people who lead this sort of life will end up regretting it in the long run. Most of these sorts of people I knew at 15/16 ended up with a low paid/no job at 18 and no skills and no ambition to make a change. You're at the point of your life where you can focus on your future. Change doesn't happen overnight, not even in a week, not in a month, heck you'd be lucky to change your life around in a year. But at your age you have a massive opportunity. Focus on your future. Think about what you want to achieve, what kind of lifestyle you want to lead. Be realistic, but be ambitious. Some of your problems will follow you for many months or many years but you need to have a drive to overcome them. Your best option would be to think about what you want to do in the future and how you can work towards it in the next year. Do you want to continue school? Then probably consider moving schools once the academic year is finished. Think about apprentiship/training schemes or college courses you might want to do, or think about a job you want to get. Focus on something you know you enjoy.  This is because i always feel like i walk weird, Have a very asymetrical face (ugly), underdeveloped jaw, i run weird my whole body just doesnt look right. i have confidence in my body i had a workout addiction i just dont think its all in proportion, im scared to do stuff because it just doesnt ever look right when i do it. Im always judging myself probably a habit im just not used to going days without torment. Pretend you're an actor. I don't mean that you should try to change the way you look or to try and do everything perfectly, but put yourself in the mindset of an actor. Your new role is to play a confident, good looking guy who knows he looks great and will be a great person. When you have a negative thought about yourself, go into acting mode and pretend you're the guy everyone likes and wants to be. If you're looking in the mirror and don't like what you see, change the scene. Change the lighting in the room, the angle you're facing or the distance you are from the mirror until you think 'maybe I don't look too bad'. Because you don't look at someone else and study them up close for hours on end and find all of their flaws. Other people look at you from a distance and don't see your flaws, just like you don't notice all of theirs. Believe me the reason you look at yourself and think that you're ugly is psychological and if you start acting the role of the guy you want to be, you will realise that you're actually not too far off.",3

When I talk to someone my mind just goes BLANK. Worst thing is that I’m 21 and people around me ALREADY have so much more experience/stories with: parties, drugs, alcohol, trips, work and all that stuff regular people my age do. All they talk about is this and I just can’t relate. And it’s not that I don’t want to experience these things as well, it’s just my social anxiety that prevents me from having these experiences. I feel so isolated and everyone and everything feels so distant. Even when people talk about music, films, books etc. I feel like I can say nothing even tho I watch lots of movies, listen to variety of genres and so on... I fucking hate it and hate myself. I feel so uncomfortable, unable to even start a small talk. I either panic or my mind just goes blank and it’s literally impossible to keep the conversation going. Last night I even had to apologise to my date that I went silent for like an hour while we were out. Today he offered me to go hiking with his friends and I just refused because I am so scared not to make a bad impression of myself. Also, I started studying in a university abroad two years ago, dropped out at the end of the first year because I was involved in a really toxic relationship with a person who had some serious narcissistic traits, came back home and for a year I just stayed at home and was extremely depressed, feels like my life just stopped. Now I’m back at uni again, a different one and I’m trying so bad to socialise but it just feels so wrong, unnatural and like people just find me weird because I’m not like one of them or at least I feel like they do.

I can have a panic attack from just thinking about being in a social situation and I’m in an almost constant state of panic when im around people or being outside in public. I am also underweight and constantly lose a lot of weight because of the stress from the anxiety and because I cant eat and lose my appetite when I’m anxious, which is too often. I also have high blood pressure as a result of my anxiety as well. It has caused me to miss out on many opportunities, and meeting new people The social affects the anxiety has had on me has ruined my school experience so far, and made me very reclusive and not able to make friends or hang out at parties and having a normal school life and pretty much alienated me. Not being able to talk to people and having near constant panic attacks has also negatively effected my academics and sometimes I can’t even go to class because the panic attack i get before is so bad, or i have a panic attack in class and have to leave and miss the whole lecture or whatever we are doing. I wouldn’t say i have been able to manage it so far, because i cant live a normal fulfilling life or make new friends or get a job, but i have been able to reduce the severity of attacks by doing certain breathing exercises and listening to music. I decided when i got to college, enough was enough and i didn’t wanna just keep barely scraping by with my anxiety anymore and i sought help from the campus therapist who said she thought i should try medication and recommended me to the nurse practitioner who prescribed me Lexapro. I took it for a few weeks and it didn’t help at all with my anxiety and had some unpleasant side effects, i told the nurse practitioner and she upped the dose but it still doesn’t help at all, and my grades are suffering really badly from missing class because of my anxiety so i was desperate for a solution so i started “self medicating” by smoking cigarettes to cope with the panic attacks and anxiety, which i know aren’t good for you (my grandparents died from smoking and many people in my family have complications like emphazima from it) and are very addicting but its more effective than anything else and I couldn’t afford to miss anymore class. I told both the n.p. and the therapist that i picked up smoking to help with the anxiety because the lexapro isn’t working and they said to just continue on the lexapro as i have been and didn’t seem too worried that i started smoking cigarettes to alleviate my symptoms ",3

My father was/is an abusive alcoholic piece of trash and made my life a living hell whenever he was home. And my mother could't stop him because she was affraid, he would hit her whenever she said something that he wasn't agreeing with. In my first years as a teenager, I was actually doing pretty good, somehow. I loved going out with friends, socializing, meeting new people, go shopping, all the normal things teenagers do. And one day, out of nowhere, after ending a bad relationship (that rised my stress levels through the roof), I find myself in front of the class (in high school), in a middle of a presentation, having a full blown panic attack. I was shaking so bad that I couldn't even read from my paper, I had to run from class because I didn't know what was happening to me. And that was how it all started. After that day, I became so anxious when it comes to social situations that even ""normal""/easy things from day to day are extremely difficult for me to do, like: talking over the phone with people I don't know, talking to the cashiers, speaking in front of a crowd, participating in group activities, talking to strangers, going to social events, damn, even walking in public it's a struggle. Sometimes I feel like I'm an alien that is trying to ""blend"" in with the people. Especially when I am talking to someone I'm not familiar with, I stutter, my mind goes blank, I forget what things are called, I don't know what to do with my hands, so I will just make so many gestures that it looks like we're talking different languages, my face would go red sometimes, but it's not that obvious (thanks to make up) and so on.

I dressed pretty good sense my brother wanted me to be in some of the photos So we both find out way to the pool area sense this was at the GF's friends place, and they had a pool. We started shooting the basketball at the pool, then my mom calls from the porch that were leaving. I stay to see what shes doing, then she goes up to ask her friend that was there what she was going to do to see that everyone left. She didn't seem upset, just kinda surprised and we both had a laugh over it, then head back to the pool area Then we start playing some random game, like we through a rock into the pool and we had to use the net to get it out or we had to drop in and get it (its harder then it sounds) I lost eventually so i had to go in and get in and get my stuff wet Then we played with the basketball a bit more and eventually we started to throw the basketball like right next to thing and try to get eachother wet we spent like a hour and 15m something together we both where laughing most of the time and It seems like she had a good time I couldn't tell if it was flirting or not, i dont think she would have tho I didnt end up getting the chance to say bye, but I snaped her after to say I had a good time. It took a while bc she gets alot of snaps but i think 2 hours later she snaps back a cute full face saying ""had fun too"" or something along those lines So that is where I am rn, and idk where to move forward I think I might just outright tell my brother if he asks how it went with her that I find her attractive, regardless its still a risk TL;DR: for once i wasn't really that socially and had a good time w/ her, dunno what to do now ",2

dnjuhm,Wildlife,"Medication advice for social anxiety.... Hi all,nnI'm 25 years old and been struggling with social anxiety for most of my teenage and adult life. For the last couple of years, I have been trying to deal with it independently through herbal supplements like L-theanine and Valerian Root, but still find myself overwhelmed with anxiety in most social situations to the point where I ""black out"" - people tell me that I'm talking coherently and sound cool, calm, and collected, but when I think back on that situation, I can't remember how I spoke, what my audience's attention level was, or even most of what I said. nnThis blackout mental state applies to social parties where I dont know many people, times of conflict between friends and coworkers, and any sort of public speaking capacity. I'm a wildlife biologist and have some meetings coming up of statewide importance where I'll be presenting several proposed regulatory changes to hunting regulations. Obviously, I cant afford to risk my social anxiety affecting my performance and reputation at these public meetings. Moreover, in my anxiety overridden mind, I dont have the mental clarity to convey facts and what's germane to the conversation well and am always kicking myself post-presentation for important points I meant to say but didn't.nnSo, I'm finally throwing in the towel on thinking I can ""beat"" my social anxiety and am going to pursue some kind of anxiety medication to help me. I hate to admit it, but I need help. I'm a little freaked out by medications for mental illnesses - my twin sister has been on them for several years and I dont even recognize her anymore. nnAny folks out there with social anxiety that can share their experiences with different medications and what worked and didnt work for them, side effects, etc? I'm considering pursuing the Benzodiazepine route initially. Seems like that would help me avoid a long-term dependence on medications that I have to be on daily.nnThanks in advance for your information, guys.",2
qf2uhn,"outside , soccer, soccer"," I am doing an exchange year but my social anxiety is making my mental health here pretty bad and I kind of regret my decision.... Hi:) Ok, so this is probably gonna be a very long post.. sorry about that. So I (16F) am from Germany but I am currently doing an exchange year in Texas and going to a high school here. I've always struggled with social anxiety and it has always made my life a little bit harder. But overall and especially since acknowledging it I was able to get along with it fine. And although I struggled with my friends situation in Germany too, I was at a point where I was pretty comfortable. I had 3 close friends (although 1 maybe not as much anymore and I only very regularly met up with one of them), I felt comfortable in school and in my class since I had been in the same class with the same people for 5 years, I had a good relationship with my parents and siblings (although looking back now I definitely didn’t appreciate and acknowledge them enough) and I was just overall doing ok I guess. So I always wanted to do an exchange year and decided to actually do it and go to school in the US for 10 months. I was really excited about it and thought going specifically to the US would help me get more open and overcome my social anxiety since the people here are known for being very open. I thought about it a lot and imagined how my life here would be. Everyone I ever heard of told me that doing an exchange year was the best decision and one if not the best year of their lives. So I felt encouraged and I felt confident I could do it. I knew that this would be a very big challenge for my social anxiety but since my English was already very good and I was basically already fluent I decided that would make it one challenge less and I would be able to jump over my shadow and do this. Well I have been here for 3 months now and it is just so much harder than I ever could have imagined, I cry myself to sleep a lot and my mental health overall and my social anxiety is just much worse than it was at home. I live in a host family here and I do get along with them pretty well in general and besides the fact that living with a family you never knew before, of course, is very weird I would say I have gotten used to living here, and rather comfortable. The only thing giving me a lot of issues here are the kids. The little girl is just not respecting my boundaries at all and tries to hug me every time she gets the chance to, even though and because she knows that I do not like hugs and they make me uncomfortable. That's just one thing but I'm not really gonna get into the other reasons here. So as I said I am a senior at a high school here. So as you might imagine I don't really have any friends. The only friend group that I have here are the other exchange students but that is just a little bit different because we're going through the same thing of course and I didn't really have to do anything myself to get these friends yk and a lot actually like went through my host sister (I have a double placement which means There is another exchange student living in my house and without her I probably would not survive this here at all (the kids and just everything in general). I don't really have any classes with them though besides one class I have with my host sister. In this class, we have 2 „friends“ but as you might imagine I wasn't the one that like initiated that and we don't meet them like outside of school. I don't have any friends in any of my other classes because I am just mentally (it feels like it's physically) not able to take the first step and start talking to people and then keeping it going. Before coming here I kind of thought everyone would know I'm not from here and be interested in talking to me, which is pretty naive to think but that's what I heard from some former exchange students. Well, my school here is huge (2770 students, for comparison my german school roughly has 600) and no one is interested in talking to me. And if they are then they ask like 2 questions and then they're not interested anymore. And I guess my accent also is not strong enough for people to know I'm not from here. Also, they are probably used to people not speaking perfect English since we have a lot of students coming from Mexico at my school that only speak Spanish and a little bit of English. Our school has A and B days and 4 classes per day. A day is the day where I have forensic science with my host sister which makes it an ok day but still in the other classes I pretty much just quietly does my work alone. Well, B-day is way worse… I quietly do my work the whole day since I don't have any friends or people talking to me on that day. I also have my less favorite classes on B-day. So I just kind of exist and get through with these school days but I never really have fun in school. And I mean I came here to experience the American high school so It makes me feel so bad and guilty and like I'm wasting time and I'm just not really happy in school here. Most exchange students say to join a club or a sport and that that will make it very easy to find friends, so since I already played a little bit of soccer in Germany I joined the soccer team. Sadly that didn't help me either and it just kind of feels a little awkward a lot of the time. This whole thing is just being really bad for my mental health, I cry a looot here and I'm just not really that happy here and I just want to be home so often. I have friends that are doing an exchange year as well and seeing all their stories and talking to them and hearing about how happy they are here and how ist the best year of their lives and they don't want to leave and just only see them having like a lot of friends just hurts e a lot and makes me feel so bad. I've already unfollowed every exchange student I am not personally friends with but it is still very hard. One of my best friends (the one I meet more often) is doing an exchange year as well and she is the only one I ever really open up to about my social anxiety since she also has an anxiety disorder and can relate a lot better and I don't know why but she is just the only one I feel comfortable talking to about my struggles. So for her ist pretty much the opposite and her mental health got so much better being here and hearing from her just hurts so much too. And she tries to help me but I just feel like right now I have no one that can relate to me and really understand me and I'm just t not really a person that opens up easily which means I'm not really comfortable opening up to anyone. And now my birthday is in like 2 weeks and I just don't know how I'm supposed to be able to feel happy on my birthday in this situation when it's gonna be my first birthday ever without my family and also without my twin sister who is doing an exchange year as well (which makes me compare mine to hers as well too of course and it's really hard to see her be so happy too). And of course, I'm happy for all my friends and that they are having such an amazing time but I am just not and that makes it so difficult for me to feel happy for them. I just don't know what to do anymore and how I'm supposed to make it through the next 7 months. And don't get me wrong of course there are still happy moments here like when I'm hanging out with the other exchange students but otherwise I just kind of regret my exchange year a little bit. And also every you do have a Local coordinator from the agency that is supposed to talk to you regularly and just help you with things but mine is just not that present. Technically she is supposed to talk to us like once every 2 weeks and meet us at least once a month but I have only seen and talked to my local coordinator once for like 10 minutes after the first month. She was also supposed to give us an orientation where she goes over rules advice etc when we got here but she never did that either. So although she does seem like a nice person she's just so busy with her own family and her job she doesn't really do her job as a local coordinator that well and it just doesn't make me comfortable enough to talk to her about this. Sorry, this was so long but I just kind of needed to rant about this and let it all out somewhere, and maybe one of you has some advice for me… ",2
5iv8j4,bike," Mission: make friends, failed once again.. Hey guys, just a little introduction: I'm 20, generally introverted and quiet, I've been pretty much friendless for 3/4 of my life, except early elementary school, but I'm not sure if I can even count that as ""friends"", they were just acquaintances from the same street and we'd rike bikes and play games together. There was a japanese culture convention in my city today. I thought that was a great opportunity to make friends and maybe even get a girlfriend - after all, they are most likely sharing the same interests as me and are quiet, introverted, et cetera. So I decided to go. I was obviously stressed at the idea, but I still did it. At first it was kinda nice: they gave me an ID with an orange color meaning that I want people to approach me and talk with me. I went to the first room, there was an integration class going on, we all sat in a circle, they were introducing themselves. I couldn't recognize any anime they were talking about, though, and it was all slow so I walked out before the end and checked out the ""store"" with all kinds of merchandise. Then I went to many different rooms with all kind of people. Lectures, dancing games, etc. All that time I was a ball of stress. My self-esteem is so low that it's funny. I was telling myself: relax, everything's alright, but my body was thinking different. In five hours, I was just walking alone from room to room, playing retro games, looking at the same merchandise all over again (I bought two haruhi suzumiya and totoro related gadgets), drank one tea or sitting in the hallway on my phone. Everytime I saw a girl - and believe me, they were so beautiful and in cosplay - I had no idea what to do with myself. I tried to talk with them, but I failed. I approached two girls and started talking with them, but some other guy came by, said something and they forgot about me and focused on him. I had a conversation with only one girl - a cosplayer - because I missed her lecture - we talked a bit, she was extremely nice. But then I we kind of parted our ways. She was with her friends anyways. I just came home and I'm not even sure how to feel about all that. By now, everyone had pairs or groups of some kind, all talking with eachother. Now I'm not even sure what to do. It's another time that I failed at making friends. I don't care about lots of friends, I just want one, or a girlfriend, just to spend time nice together. It's sooo difficult though. Thanks for reading, anyways. ",2

dcqz5j9,tennis," I can relate so freaking much to this. My life also went downhill ever since the end of 12th grade. First years in college sucked bad (I failed in them, now an official drop-out but making a granted comeback and actually things going well for the first time in 2 years) just when I though college would save me from this empty loop I've dropped into when I hit 18. On a brighter aspect, now, as a 20 year old freshman, I'm getting my shit together finally. Just at this phase I have figured out my hobbies (from Guitar playing to Tennis to Programming) and what my actual cons and pros are. How? Well currently my social anxiety (and subsequently, my mild depression) has been on its lowest levels since 2014 and I guess it is thanks to the gym, sticking to a healthy lifestyle (stable sleeping cycle, healthy food, excercising), and overcoming some bad habits of mine just because i GENUINELY wished I could stop them (e.x: biting nails, have had it since 2 years old). So yeah, I'd recommend those steps to anyone in our case. They surely have some amazing effects on us. Key is don't stress yourself over it, they're not that easy but are definitely approachable. Baby steps. Performing every day slightly better than its previous. Things like that that get to your unconsciousness, rip off the negative thoughts, and embrace the good ones about yourself and the world around you. It's all about loving yourself and your life first, so opening up and feeling loved by others won't be that big of a deal anymore; both things coming naturally. What you wrote is very insightful; thank you for sharing it, and have a happy birthday! Hope your twenties may be full of joy, adventures and love :) ",2
55lvdy,skate," Does anyone else feel like who they are and what they do is directly linked to what you think the people around you think of you?. As stated in the title, I feel like my personality and my abilities are what I think the people around me think they are. For example I grew up skateboarding and snowboarding a lot. I was pretty decent, if I skated in front of someone who had seen me skate well before, I would skate well. Now if I skated in front of someone who didn't know I skateboarded (therefore would be judging me) or someone who I for some reason thought that they wouldn't think I was good, I would skate terribly. Its the same way with anxiety symptoms, once I blush in front of someone, every time I see them i feel like they are expecting it, and it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. In a way its like I literally have no self confidence, any confidence that I have is based on how I perceive what the people around me think of me. Does anyone else feel like this? ",2

8tr5ml,"outside , bike, bike, bike"," I had a bad experience today. I don't know if this belongs here, I mean I think it does. I have severe social anxiety and I am really anxious right now. I am at my grandfather's farm and we live on a road where there aren't a lot of people, or shouldn't be. It is near a few small towns however. I have been doing well with my social anxiety, until right now. I know I shouldn't be bothered by one bad person, but now I don't know if I should trust people anymore. My grandpa has a few dogs, boxers and they might jump but they are quite gentle. I am outside looking around when I hear someone shouting, which scares me. There is this lady on a bike. She yells at me ""Get your dogs away!"" Keep in mind the dogs are not near her, and are just on the driveway, they only go over when she starts yelling. I try to get them away, but she keeps yelling at me which makes me shake because it is terrifying me. I say ""Well maybe people shouldn't bike on this road."" She than says ""I shouldn't ride my bike here!?"" I mean this isn't where she lives, so I don't get her logic, anyone who lives on that road knows there are lots of animals, not just on my grandpas farm but other peoples too. I see her ride off and I just run into the house crying and feel this feeling of terror that I can't even feel in a nightmare. I have been diagnosed with social anxiety because I couldn't go to school. Last year my mother almost hit someones car and the lady went off on her, which made me terrified of cars. I can't easily go to my own town anymore because of that. I don't feel safe where I have felt safe for years. I am scared of her, of other people. Also a car stopped while I was trying to get the dogs off the road, and the man starts laughing at me. I'm scared, I don't want her to hurt my dogs or me or my grandpa. I phoned my aunt when I was about to have a panic attack, I felt one coming and she talked to me for a while. I am sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, but I am really scared. I don't feel like I can handle life, I am already a failure. I'm only 14 but I am really hurt, I am sorry for bothering anyone but I don't know what to do. I thought my anxiety was getting better but it feels like I am going through it all over again. I mean did the man laugh because I look fat, or I'm short, I'm stupid? I'm embarrassed, scared and really depressed. I wish I could just disappear. ",2
glrrso,camping,"25 with no close friendships. When I was in high school, I realized that I was always the one who pursued friendships, and that all of the people I hung out with didn’t seem to reciprocate our friendship. Looking back, it was upsetting to me that it seemed to me that no one actually wanted to be my friend, they just would be if it was convenient. So, basically, when I was 16, I stopped inviting my friends to do things, telling myself that if they cared about me, they would invite me to do things with them. I still had some normal social stuff in high school...a senior camping trip, a group to go to dinner with before prom...but pretty much all of my close friendships ended. Most of them were good riddance...a lot of my “friends” has blatantly bullied me in middle school anyway. I’ve realized that this is a huge part of why I’m now 25 and terrible and social interactions. I let that mindset bleed into potential friendships in college and now as an adult too. There are tons of perfectly wonderful people I associated with in college, but very few that I was “close” with and none who I talk to now, mostly because I can’t let myself open up and be myself. Basically the only person who I consider to truly be my “friend” now is my fiancé, who I live with. I struggle to even participate in conversations because I’m so self conscious, to the point where my future brother in law’s girlfriend thinks I don’t like her. I only talk openly or show any personality when I’ve had a drink or two, and then I’m just as likely to embarrass myself because I’m either tipsy or I just say shit that doesn’t come out right because I’m not good at talking to people. I’ve been thinking about how I got to be this way for a while because I’m unhappy with the fact that I don’t have friends and wanted to share this with people who might relate. Thanks.",2
86didi,"outside ,  stream"," I've been socially anxious for so long that I don't even know what to say and what to do when I actually go outside and interact with people. Example - I've been considering going to the gym, but the problem is that not only does the idea of exercising in front of strangers terrify me, what also scares me is that I don't know exactly how to get in that situation. Like, when I enter the gym - where do I go first? Is there a receptionist or do I have to look for someone elsewhere? If there is one, how do I ask them that I want to use their gym? Like which exact words do I say? I have no idea. Is there something expected of me to bring with me? Will they point me to where I have to go or will I have to figure it out by myself? What exactly do I do next? etc. It's just a stream of question and uncertainties. A million chances to make a fool of myself. A million if chances to misspeak, look confused, have my voice crack, do something incorrectly and embarrass myself in general. I wish there was a set of instructions on the internet for everything I could follow and make sure I'm doing things the way others find acceptable. Like a screenplay. Everything is so fucking complicated. Every place is completely different. The type of people you'll meet will be completely random. You can't prepare yourself and it's terrifying. You know what pisses me off the most? Humanity has been around for thousands of years and we still haven't managed to create a world where life is simple and easy. It's safe to say I hate all of my ancestors for failing at this.

So I watched some youtube videos about bikes and found a video where a guy is testing mountain bikes on some rural bike paths and it looked like soooo much fun. I wanted to do it immediately but I quickly realized that it would not turn out the way I imagined it. He was alone there, I would probably be unlucky enough to arrive at a time the place was full of teenagers who would make fun of me. I would love to buy a bike and just ride on rural paths but it will never happen because the embarrassment would kill me. Just the idea of someone seeing me cycling is so cringe. ",2

bc8wfg," park,  walk"," Short story of me standing up for myself very confidently. So I can’t provide much context as this happened about 9 months ago. I’m sharing this because I’m proud of myself for it and don’t really have anyone else to share it with. I was in a toxic friendship with these two guys and my therapist knew it. He helped coach me out of the friendship after this event. Anyway, my two friends and I were hanging out at a park. One of the friends, we’ll call him joe, was trying to be some controlling alpha leader of us at the time. My self esteem was too low to do anything about it until this day. He was being his usual annoying and controlling self and I decided “fuck it”. I start walking in front of him leading us back to the car and he gets pissed. “Oh wow slowerthan is leading us. Now we’re gonna get lost”. Now I could see I was right about him wanting to be some alpha male leader. I ignored his comment and kept walking. He began projecting at me “slowerthan’s so mad! He’s so mad right now!” I wasn’t mad I was very happy with myself and kept ignoring him. He then takes some awkwardly angled photo of me and says “I’m gonna post it! I’m gonna post it!” I smile at him and say “post it!” He doesn’t. He says “I want ice cream”. Bear in mind that our other friend, we’ll call him mike, wanted to go home and we had already agreed on this earlier. Also keep in mind that joe always has to do what he wants and ignores other people’s objections, including driving recklessly on the highway. I immediately respond, “we can go through a drive thru and get ice cream on the way back.” He objects, expectedly. I say “it’s a compromise it’s what adults do”. He finally shut up for the day. Later, he blew up on me over text sending paragraph after paragraph attacking my insecurities and what not. I ended up hanging out with him some time later and he acted overly nice to me out of fear. I know he was afraid because while we were driving in a car, after he blew up on me over text, he accidentally touched my arm with his arm on the center console and physically jumped. Currently I am very distant from him. Stand up for yourself, especially if someone is toxic and worsens your mental health. Thanks for reading. ",2

i42jrl,"riding , mountain"," I GOT TO RIDE IN A TESLA. AGH IM SUPER PROUD OF MYSELF FOR THIS My sister(20F), her friend(20M), and I (16F) went riding around our state just enjoying being out of the house. We were parked on top of a mountain looking over a city when a Blue Tesla suddenly parked next to us. We saw it before when we were driving around the mountain but we never saw the owner and my sister was saying how much she loved the car. I joked around and said “One of us should just go up and say ‘hey I like your car’” my sister took that as a chance to annoy me and started teasing me saying I should do it and that I would never. Me being the annoying little sibling took that as a challenge so I put on my mask and got out of the car (not going to lie I was walking back and forth between our two cars for ten minutes because I just realized what I got myself into). My sister was recording as her and her friend were laughing so then I finally did it I walked up to the car and saw this really beautiful lady in the drivers side. I knocked on the window and said “hey my friends and I thought u had a really cool car and I also think you’re really cute and cool so uh yeah” (I get word vomit when trying to initiate a conversation which I rarely do). Turns out the lady actually WORKED for Tesla so she offered all three of us a little joy ride up and down the mountain, we even got to see some really cool stuff like how they have a “romance” setting where it shows a fireplace on the screen and the AC suddenly turns to heat as ur seat starts to warm up. It was just like sitting next to a fire! THEY ALSO HAD A WHOOPIE CUSHION SETTING THAT U COULD PASS AROUND TO EACH SEAT AND CHANGE WHAT FART SOUND COMES OUT OF IT. It was super cool and since I was the one who went up to her I got to ride in the front seat which I NEVER get to do because of my sisters friends and stuff. We said we wouldn’t tell our parents (partly because we went from 0-60 MPH in 3 seconds and one simple turn of the wheel we would’ve literally fallen off of the mountain) but honestly this is such a big accomplishment for me! I mean I still to this day can’t order food for myself I tell my family what I want and they do it for me so the fact that I went up to her and then got to ride in a freaking TESLA is so so big for me!! I guess talking to people every now and then isn’t so bad and hopefully I can work up the courage in the future to do it.(I can’t wait to tell my therapist about this!!) ",2

anccqi,playground," Sexist incident when I was 5 years old.. Lots of people are going to think this is stupid, but here goes. I'm a guy. When I was 5 years old, I had gotten into the habit of lifting up girls' skirts as a form of a prank. I know its not a nice thing to do. I don't know where I picked up the habit from, but I used to do it at school for a very short time. Eventually a teacher had called me into her office during recess. One of my friends had come to the playground to tell me that she wanted to see me. I was shitting bricks because I had no idea what I had done wrong. The teacher told me to take a seat and then talked about my skirt pulling habit. She asked me where I picked up that habit from and then told me that it was a very '' dirty '' thing to do. Now you might say that I was just 5 years old and I must have imagined this but......that was the first time in my life where I felt like I was being attacked because of my gender. There was a lot of in-between-the-lines stuff and judgemental overtones in the way she was talking to me and looking at me. She didn't simply say that it was a rude thing to do to pull people's clothes.....she implied that I was '' dirty '' for engaging in that behavior and treating girls specifically like that. I think its messed up to gender police little children like that and treat them like they're something that they're not. But I think its because we are living in an increasingly gynocentric society that doesn't care about boys or their feelings. Anyways just wanted to share this here. I think incidents like this can have a detrimental effect on the self esteem of boys and make them feel out of place. ",2
lasccb,"skate, skating, skating, skate, skate,  walk, outdoor, skate, skate"," I (25F anxious blob) going to ask a great skater out for an ice skating date! Wish me luck + anxiety management tips! :). It’s been so cold (close to -30 degrees) and all I’ve been doing with my person (35M, also anxious blob) have been cooking dinner together and watching TV. The weather is going to be better this weekend and I’ve been thinking of finally going ice skating with him. He basically grew up on ice and plays hockey. I have ice skated at most five times in my life and every single time, I can at best penguin waddle and have to hold onto someone’s hands. He asked me if I wanted to ice skate together on our second date back in early December but because I am super anxious that I’d make a fool out of myself in front of him and everyone else (there was no lockdown back then), I opted for a walk instead. Now that there’s a very empty and covid safe rink around our houses, I’m tempted to try again. I’m excited at the idea but super embarrassed that I still can’t even stand alone on ice. Basically, how do I let my guards down a little bit and have fun doing this without stressing too much? Do people find dates unattractive if they are not good at an outdoor activity? Because of my social anxiety, I don’t do things I’m not good at at all but I’d like to try things with this person. I’ve found myself wanting to ice skate with him a few times by now but had always stopped myself from asking him because I’m scared of coming off unattractive. Any tips/words of encouragement appreciated! Thank you. 😊 TLDR: Socially anxious bad ice skater wants to try the rink with a really good hockey player. How do I make this happen without backing out like before or without stressing too much? ",2
5w9wd6,"soccer, outside , run "," Intense feeling of humiliation made me introverted. I was socialising before that, I was extrovert, now I am Recluse-Extrovert.. It is all connected to pride. I figured it all along. First time I didn't manage to defend my Pride was when a bigger boy tried to bully me when I was 10-11 year old. Second time was when some boys that I played football(soccer) with, said that I was really amazing at it, but made fun of my skinny figure, I was small for my age, even now. They said: You are good but you cannot be bigger age than us... And asked me to recite the multiplication table, I got tense and made some wrong answers. I can still remember after so many years their reaction, and the reaction of my friends that played with us: ''I don't know guys hes grandmother told us that he is an A student''...and I was, that's true. I was because I wanted to please my parents. Not for myself. Pride is the mother of Social Anxiety for me. Third time was in High school I was skinny and short, still am and some of the boys tried to bully me to make themselves feel better... I fought back but they were more so I stopped talking to them - again my Pride received another blow. I felt humiliated. Became recluse: playing games, staying all day in my room. That was in 2006- 7th grade (Last time I was ""shot in the heart"") - so I became a recluse. Now I go to University - but I don't socialise at all. Protecting my Pride from the outside world. Also my overbearing parents contributed because: 'They always told me: 'To act kindly to all people, no matter bad or good. Because the bad can make me suffer.'' Well I did that, and look what happened. Bad people will try to run over you. If they sense you are weak, survival of the fittest, we are not animals but in socializing we are to some degree. TLDR: Too much Dignity, Honour at the heart of all Social Anxiety. ",2

We were at the playground and he was having a meltdown because I was not letting him do something ridiculous, like climb on the canopies over the playground equipment, when a little boy kept following him around because he wanted to play. My son just stopped and SCREAMED ""STOP FOLLOWING ME!"" Other little boy burst into tears and ran to his mother. He was like 3 or 4. Poor kid.

auap3k,soccer," Missing out, feeling like no one relates. I’m a junior (11th) in highschool, and I’m sad highschool is nearing an end for me. In 6th grade I was essentially bullied, which turn me into a mute hermit basically. I literally do not speak until I’m spoken too, I only have 2 somewhat distant friends and miraculously a boyfriend. I never went out, I never had close friends, I was on a soccer team but I was literally mute. When I read stories from other people online, who were in a similar situation they always seem to pull themselves out of it, or the highschool and middle school loners I hear about were just loners because they wanted to be rather than because they had anxiety and couldn’t pull themselves out of it. I hope that makes sense. I want to be social, I want to have friends, but I can’t. I have the fear of people over hearing my conversations, so I don’t speak in public. Every time I leave a social interact I’m embarrassed or I feel like I was being “fake”. I’m embarrassed by my own thoughts, and I’m deeply sad I never experienced “teen things”, i can’t relate to the rebellious teen. I already have OCD, and I regret something so deeply that I’ve done in my past. I used to plan using drugs or something like that to get out there and be social like I so strongly wished. But I know that would do more harm than good, and yes that’s a thought I’m embarrassed about. I did things out of loneliness I regret so much. At times, I’m so ashamed of who I am. I feel like I’m in a pit and there’s no way to climb out of it. The OCD makes my romantic relationship horrifying, to the point where I wake up everyday with anxiety in my gut. I only ever spend time with my boyfriend or my parents and that’s the extent of my social life. I want things to change so badly, I hope to join this small show choir next year and I hope that will turn some thing around. Hopefully in college I can make some friends. But here’s the thing: my window of friendship, I feel, is closing in on me. I feel like once I’m in my mid-20s the opportunity for a friendship like the ones you find in highschool will be completely gone. You know how kids and marriages get in the way of being with friends. I imagine a miserable future where I’m back to the situation I’m in now, just the parent instead of the child. I hope that makes sense. I hope I could actively achieve friendship when I’m older, if I strive for it. Other wise, I’m lost, helpless, riddled with a million other problems also. ",2

71h2cv,"sun, running,  walk"," College Life and stuff idk it's a story.... I'm a freshman at college and it's the hardest thing I have ever done, I'm not gonna lie I don't regret it and I really like it but this is really making me fight myself a lot. I have always had severe anxiety and it caused a 2 year long depression too (18 Male). I was raised in a very small town in a very small school, 30 people in my class and we were considered big. I am going to a college that is Little over 15 minutes away from my family. Everyone and their mothers told me to get a dorm and I did which I thought would be like the most anxiety testing thing I ever do, it wasn't. Mainly because unlike other dorms I had a room to myself but I share a living room, it's like an apartment but smaller. My room mate is a guy who goes to my same counselor but he has aspurgers so he says a lot of things that really mess with me and it takes me a while to convince myself that he didn't mean it, don't comment explaining how he did mean it or anything... it's how I cope with not freaking out on a daily basic. My first fear was of friends. How do I meet them, where do I meet them, what do I say, if you are reading this you probably know where that was going so I'll continue. Long story short I sat at a table with one empty chair and now I have 6 friends that I hang out with like every other day or so? So that's a success hurray for me! They introduced me to a random girl they saw and became my first girlfriend, second success. Not to go into details but she was my ""first"" of a lot of things...3rd success? Does it count if she dumped me within a week to focus on studies?.... I like to think so... we'll call that a half success I guess? The first day of college I told myself I'll talk to the first person that catches my eye at all, it was a girl with a backpack that had a bunch of Eeveelutions on it from Pokemon. We talked the entire walk from the dorms to our classes. She dyed her hair red afterwards so she's not the most eye catcher of them all because I really like dyed hair and stuff... it's cool. I seen her around multiple times while hanging out friends and/or doing college stuff but I haven't had the courage to talk to her again because either she's with friends, or I'm not in the right state to talk to her without freaking out. Than one day me and one of my friends go to the cafe for lunch and boom there she is talking to a friend. I start rambling to my friend the numerous reasons why I shouldn't talk to her. She has a friend. What if she's not interested? What if she's not interested in men??? It'll look weird. I ended up tricking myself into sitting next to her and talking to her until they left because they were just about to leave before I sat down, that's like what? 3.5 successes? She stayed longer to talk from what I thought. When she got up I panicked and asked ""hey we should exchange numbers so we can chat some more?"" She gave me her number and left and for the walk back to my dorm I was on top of the world........ it was fake btw. I see her everyday and it freaks me out now because of the number thing, so much that my friends warn me and give me cover ups to not confront her. Is that even a helpful thing? Because a part of my mind is very small and says ""M-maybe she didn't mean to."" A slightly louder voice says ""Maybe there's still hope if just keep idle chit chat when you see here and wait until she asks for your number or something."" Than there's a really loud screaming voice that well... screams ""YOU BLEW IT!!! OR YOU NEVER HAD IT TO BLOW IN THE FIRST FACE!!!"" Today though I was in my solar system class and I saw this girl there that I found was really cute and... ok this is gonna sound weird because it's like a class thing but the way she said Woden and could name all the Germanic gods was impressive for me... not the saying Woden thing that was a part of the cute thing. So I saw that she was right next to me walking out so I talked to her for a bit, didn't catch her name but we have the same class so it's like no rush, don't want to mess things up like with Red hair... did I mention she had the same name and Major as my ex gf I previously mentioned? Anyways so that's another opposite gender I talked to, 4.5 success! Man typing this is really helping me feel so much better about myself. So here's the part where I get down again because I have to revisit it yaaaaay~ I was walking back to my dorm when I see the divine light from the sun bounce off the fiery scarlet mane of someone in front of me. I know we'll be going the same way for almost the entire walk. So I make a quick cross of the road to be on the other side than her. That helped me but than I remembered the path we take, where now she'll cross the road soon and since I'm on the other side it'll be a direct collision instead of just me walking a few yards behind her as I would of earlier. This made me panic....I'm sounding pathetic... I hid behind this wooden fence thing that holds the dumpsters of what I assume is someone lives but it isn't a dorm, anyways I stayed there for a few minutes. Calmed down breathed and drank some water. I couldn't see if she passed the meeting point yet but I was like right there but hidden, but it been a while in relevant (is that the word?) to the amount of time it would take to pass the spot. So I got up and turned and started walking back to my dorm.... if I wasn't paying attention I would of ran into her. Boom the collision I wanted to avoid is now here and worse! Because I hid! Did she see I hid? If she saw I hid than it must look like I did so in purpose of running into her. I don't want to look like a stalker!!! I'm not a stalker! I was trying to avoid her! Not run into her! Why was she late to the spot! Did she hid too? Does she feel bad about the number? Or does she already don't like me that much? It been like a solid...3 seconds of silence of me and her just walking... same pace because I tried slowing down to get behind her like what would of gone down but I got a good foot or so on her so my slow but not noticeably slow walk with my long legs is her average walk. I started talking to her just little stuff to ease the tension that I felt so much surely she felt it. She was nice to me and was helping me figure out thing involving the actual college stuff of college and than she left because her dorm building was closer than mine... and that's it... I stayed in my dorm for the rest of the day and now I'm here writing this at midnight thinking why I am writing this I got class tomorrow morning. To whoever read this far, I know there's no way I can see who actually read this and who just clicked it and said nope but thank you. Sure you can just see my previous posts on other stuff and know who I am but you took the time to read my story and if you have any helpful comments or anything please I'd love to hear/read them. I also know that not just me is the one needing help in this subreddit so if you are going through the same college+Social Anxiety thing as I am and need someone out there who will probably never know your name and just to vent to. Message me, I know how much help it is to have someone to talk to about this stuff. If this gets positive feedback I might do it again... it really helped me just to say this stuff out loud. P.S: I put the tag Other because I don't know what it would fall under so if know, help a guy out. ",2
d8ajbkj,tennis," 1) One friend I made six years ago when I was in 7th grade. We were playing Tennis in sports lessons, and we had to find a partner to play with every follow-up lesson. Us two were left over. Normally I'm much too scared and take way too long to ""warm up"" to someone to become friends with them. But since I had two occasions every week where I had to deal with her, I could desensitize so to say and it turned out she's really nice. Unlike me, she has a very busy social life and a lot of things on her daily to-do list. We write about every second day or so via Whatsapp. Meeting maybe every second to third week? Right now, we can't meet anyway because she's doing a gap year in Namibia. 2) I have two internet friends. I found both through mental health sites (not reddit). One of them is literally 12 hours away from me. It's amazing how you can shape attachments with people on the other side of the planet.

I’m 24 and have never had a real job. I did some lawn care for a local business over the summer a few years ago, but I’m not sure if that really counts for anything. I also live with my parents and have never been to college. At all. I just had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and didn’t want to go into debt to confirm it. Might’ve also had something to do with my being an awful student in middle and high school. I wanted to get a job once I was old enough, but my family only had one car (which my dad needed) and we didn't live within walking distance of any businesses. We finally got two good cars a couple years ago, but by that point I knew employers would want to know why I had no experience at my age and was afraid that only fast-food restaurants would consider hiring me. I would rather do almost anything than that. Anyway, due to circumstances, I need to find a job before the end of the month. I found a few that might work, but the only one I really kind of want is a retail position at a hardware store. Unfortunately, the qualifications include strong interpersonal skills and strong communication skills. Not sure how my communication skills are. My interpersonal skills are definitely mediocre at best right now. While I'm hopeful that those would improve with practice, I’m not sure if they would give me a chance to find out. The only thing really going for me here is that my dad knows one of the employees and the manager. He stopped in with me a few days ago to ask the employee about a job, and he (employee) said that I should submit an application before Monday and come back *with my dad* next week to talk to the manager without an appointment. That’s really what I’m the most anxious about. This isn’t a formal interview. I have no idea how to prepare. Even though there's a position listed on their site, I suspect they may not actually be hiring right now. Even if they were, why would they want me over some outgoing 17-year-old^(1)? It’s just an entry-level job, but I *want* to work there. Still putting off actually applying. This is all just so overwhelming. I feel like a 24-year-old child.

ot1kwz,waves," Major Landmark Victory: I no longer believe that social failure = catastrophic humiliation (well, mostly lol). For 6 months I’ve been working on conquering my social anxiety. I started this journey being horrified of cashiers. I was so desperate for social change in myself that I felt like every cashier interaction that didn’t result in a friendship was a failure. I was scared every time I left my room because I thought my roommates were felt I was a weirdo/loser. I would leave some of my social experiments so brutally judging myself for not being able to succeed that I began to feel suicidal. I’m describing this to show the difference between then and now. Well the other day, I went to a social meetup at a bar that was meant for ppl new to my area. I was so scared that I walked around the block twice before entering! I tricked myself into entering by telling myself “I’m just going to get a drink, and after that I’m leaving”. Upon entering I was immediately welcomed into a group by some random guy who recognized a shirt I was wearing. I nervously joined, but I did alright. IT WASN’T CATASTROPHICALLY BAD. I even made social mistakes, but they didn’t result in some giant humiliation, just a brief moment of heightened self consciousness. I went on just fine for an hour with these guys, and then another couple hours with random other people that were all there to meet ppl. It was beautiful! Ppl who were all there with the intention of being nice and socializing. Lots of ppl I noticed were a little nervous too, which made me realize that it’s kinda normal to be nervous! It’s not just me, and I’m not just broken. The biggest thing I’ve learned, however, is that my social anxiety is catastrophic and unrealistic. While I still get waves of embarrassment that hit me in conversations, the amount of time I spend fearing humiliation before/after the situation is so much less. It has happened often enough, and under the microscope that CBT has provided me, that I no longer reinforce the irrational idea that my mistakes will result in a giant humiliating event. The emotional side of my brain is really starting to understand that the risk of mistakes are not super high. It allows me to practice consistently, effectively and deliberately. I’m not ruining my chances quite as much by just telling myself how it’s gonna go terribly wrong. Because this fear has lessened so much, I was able to walk into that bar and say “even if the worst case happens, I’ll be okay”. This is NOT the same as confidence. During conversation, I’m still a people-pleasing, not-genuine, over-smiling person who rarely lets my actual personality come to the surface. I can’t help it yet. But I more often have moments where I allow myself to act natural, and it’s because I’m not so incredibly scared of some huge humiliating event. I’m chipping away at a belief that adds pressure to situations that shouldn’t be scary: that every small social mistake can lead to humiliation! Basically I’m getting better! As much as I haven’t allowed myself to feel small successes (mostly because the idea of a confident me sounds preposterous and unrealistic), I can no longer deny it! The change is so large and obvious that I no longer believe I’m stuck in this place. I believe there is a path out of this mess, to a more functional life. And I’m on that path :). It’s enough to bring me to tears honestly. Im 26 and social anxiety disorder has been lifelong, although I have been high functioning for a good portion of my life. But I just wanna say that change is possible. And CBT has REALLY fast tracked that for me. Please keep trying, and please get help. You all can do it! I wanna see this world have more people who’ve recovered from this horrible disorder, and more role models having an online presence. Thanks for reading, I hope this does something to encourage you to keep trying. I love you all! ",2

In my experience SA and depression can very easily become stuck in a feedback loop so that they build off of themselves and become more intense the longer you avoid breaking out of the cycle. Such is the case with me right now. 1/1/16 was a great day for me. I had a good night's rest, I woke up and took a cold shower, intending to do that everyday this year. I got some reading done and cleaned off my desk which has been a mess for the past 16 months. I said, this is the first day of my new adventure where I will cut out all the toxic things in my life (bad sleep habits, porn, self-loathing, inactivity), all the bullshit, and just live simply in the present moment which I will appreciate for its own sake.

I felt sick with myself the entire day and got super depressed super fast. Started the year out on a high note and then it went sharply downhill and I've hit new lows. I feel like my mind is an underground cave and I've just fallen into one of the bottom layers, where there's no sunlight and minimal oxygen, just lakes with alien-like fish and weird creatures that look like Smeagol and those crawling monsters from the movie The Descent. I've spent the past week on an overnight sleep schedule, waking up later each day until it's night, being awake until 10am or so at which point I end up falling asleep. Trying to pull an all-nighter everyday so I can regain control but I've failed every time. I didn't go out and mostly just stayed in my room for this entire week. Didn't shower, stopped taking care of myself, started sleeping in my clothes and wearing them again the next day, hardly ate at all because I've pretty much run out of food and have been eating the same exact thing everyday. Spent my time interneting and watching movies and jerking off and feeling hopeless and disgusted with the person I've become. Part of me really wants to start working again but at the same time I'm terrified of hearing my phone vibrate which gives me mild panic attacks. This is literally the most clichéd, useless advice, but you really have to just do it. Just go out and do stuff. You're trapped in a vicious cycle, going around and around, getting worse with each revolution, and it'll never end. You may think you're going forward, or backward, but you're not, you're going in circles. That's why there's no horizon, no perceptible hope down the road. The only way to escape is to do just that. Jump out of the cycle. I'll let you know when I've done this, but it could be a while. ",2

cuyyqh,camping," Does anyone ever feel extra lonely during certain seasons?. This is a bit strange and maybe I just need to get it off my chest, with this being the only place I can do that. I've always had social anxiety, therefore I've never had many friends until I was fifteen. Through this friend I bonded with her cousin and we all became incredibly close. I truly thought our relationships were going to last until death. Well, four years later, this friend of mine left for the National Guard. Upon her return she was very different. I feel like in every relationship there are issues you'll have with that person, but you learn to adjust and focus on the more positive qualities. When she came back, those few small things that I needed to adjust to had succumbed her whole personality. She was very self - absorbed (even accusing my anxiety of being nothing compared to hers), critical and narcissistic I couldn't find a way to handle it, neither could our other friend. I lasted a bit longer. This other friend set sail rather quick and I understood why, it's just she left me as well. She said we were still friends, but we never hung out, she didn't message me and at one point she said we didn't need to talk because our relationship was so strong. I felt like that was her kind way of saying screw off. Now I'm alone again. I'm attending college but I doubt I'll meet anyone there due to being unable to make conversation or sound normal when attempting one. Maybe I've just given up. What's harder is the fall use to be our favorite season, the three of us, because we were huge Halloween lovers and were pretty active around this time of the year preparing. We went Halloween camping where we had theme costumes, did decorating, baking and of course haunted attractions. Now seeing Halloween stuff, or anything fall related, I'm just depressed and empty.

8por1v," walk, backyard, outside "," TFW the most minuscule thing makes you feel like a complete idiot.. So I’m at my boyfriend’s grandmother’s house right now because he and his brother wanted to go visit her for the day. Everything was going fine and I was pretty proud of myself for socializing semi-normally and trying to be friendly and participate in the conversation and all that, but of course something had to go wrong. My boyfriend and I decided we wanted to go for a walk around the block, and right before he left he said he wanted to stop by his car and grab his keys for later. His grandma has two dogs, and they have a little gated backyard area that swings open and shut near the back of the house. One of the dogs is a 2 month old puppy and she pooped inside right before we left, so my boyfriend’s brother picked the poop up inside and took it out back to throw it away and I guess forgot to close the gate on his way back inside. My boyfriend went out to his car and said I could just wait for him out front, so I went through the front door and was waiting near the side of the house outside for my boyfriend and suddenly his grandma stopped me and called out, “Hey! Remember to shut the gate next time or the dogs will get out!” And she wasn’t like mean about it or anything but idk, I don’t handle conflict or criticism well at all so the whole thing made me tense up immediately, So I turn around and I’m like “What?” Because I have no idea what she’s talking about and I didn’t remember going through any gate. And then she repeats herself and I basically just like froze up and was like “Oh okay I’m sorry I didn’t even notice,” and awkwardly scrambled away. And now I just feel like an idiot because I’m not even the one who left the gate open but I look like a careless person because she thinks I left it open and I didn’t go back to close it, and when I told my boyfriend about it he got all frustrated and was like “Well you should’ve just closed it anyway and moved on since she’s my grandma and she told you to.” Which made me even more upset because at first I was like, why should I feel bad for not closing the gate if I’m not even the one who opened it? And why couldn’t I just have told her “Oh sorry, it must’ve been your grandson who forgot to close it taking out the dog poop but I’ll close it anyway for you right now!” Or literally anything besides what I ended up doing and saying. I just feel so stressed and dumb and now I’m gonna spend the rest of the night hiding upstairs and doing homework and trying to pretend I don’t exist. Fml. I just needed to vent. I really wish I could communicate and process things like a normal person sometimes. ",2

I feel like they all got a manual on how to be a normal person and I was sick the day they gave them out. I sit at breaks or in class with the group of people I consider my friends and they can all talk to each other so easily, but why can't I? I just sit in silence and listen most of the time, and when I do say something I recite it and practice what I'm going to say in my head before I can even think of saying something. I feel like i'm invisible half the time, and I'm pretty sure my friends forget I exist - maybe that's why most of them unadded me on social media and don't add me to their group chats, and maybe it's why they make plans infront of me but then don't invite me (I've known them for about 5 weeks and in that time they've all met up twice, neither time with me). I feel like my perspective of friendship is so skewed; talk to me outside of class and I'll consider you a close friend i thought going to 6th form at a new school would be a great fresh start, but apparently not as I'm still treated the way I've always been - generally excluded and mocked my anxiety is ruining my life. I feel like I've missed out on so many basic things that practically everyone experiences. i'm 16 years old and have never gone over to a friends house or gone to a sleepover. even my sister (who is younger than me and says she ""has no friends"") has been to loads of them. I've never done anything interesting that I've wanted to do cause of it, never started hobbies I've always wanted to do because of it. I've wanted to learn to skateboard for 2 years now (I even have a board) but I'm to scared to go onto the streets and practice or go to a skatepark and learn hopefully things might be looking up for me though. there's a boy in my cs class I talk to outside of school sometimes - he gave me £2.12 and lent me his copy of bloodborne in exchange for a crochet thing I made, and he invited me to come to comic con with him and a couple of his friends. also, I went to the shops after school and managed to look around and buy stuff even from the men's section which I normally avoid incase of getting weird looks or being judged for being a girl there and didn't find it too bad, which is cool cause it's the 1st time i've ever been anywhere further than a 10 minute walk away from my house by myself (other than school, but that doesn't really count) ",2

If I told her I wanted to be picked up early, she’d just come pick me up. She also didn’t want to socialize with the moms at school/playground, so playdates didn’t really happen. I cried during my freshman year of high school and begged to be homeschooled. She felt bad for me and asked my dad about it. He was furious and said I would NOT be homeschooled, and honestly, I’m really glad he refused because I’m fairly certain I’d be worse off.

It's a constant struggle. Someone mentioned pursing hobbies. Might be a good idea. But if you're like myself, and don't really have any ""hobbies"", try networking at school or work. Go to parties with a friend you're comfortable with; Go out and do something with a couple close friends that have some sort of interaction with other people (bars, parties, bonfires, etc.). It's awesome being alone, and having your own free time. It sucks being lonely. But maybe it's true when people say that it will happen when you least expect it.

objocw,"soccer, run "," Social anxiety &amp; awkwardness is killing me... help. If you take time to read this, I appreciate you. So I think I got it from some shit that happened to me when I was younger. I almost died twice and I went through some abusive shit in my childhood.. u know that stuff that happens to a lot of people. In 11 I went to play soccer for an academy where I was raised and been on my own etc.. and at the moment I'm 20 years old. I hit gym three times a week, sometimes I feel confident and more like an extrovert with the right people. But.. there are sometimes awkward situations that kills me inside. Like now. My brothers run an agency and from time to time I work there since it's in the office where I can focus. Today there was a new employee and I had so much stress before introducing myself you know.. It was awkward and I had not entirely panick attack.. But I was red, shy, awkward and couldn't speak properly.. u know that shit.. It is killing me so much because I'm really an extrovert. I love when I'm in the group of people that I know and can have fun with (doesn't have to be under alcohol influence). I love that and it gives me energy. But on the other side I'm also an introvert because sometimes I like to just mind my business at home. And it's been just worse and worse. Having anxiety when going through the city, now even in introduction with other people. I just want to cry now. So.. what can I do. I tried ETF tapping - I don't know doesn't helped me but I still do it sometimes. I tried affirmations, and other type of shit and nothing helped and I'm so done with that anxiety. I want to live my life to the fullest but shit is hard. I need some therapy I guess.. but what a person like me which has not a lot of money at the moment can do?? You know.. The best ones charge insane amount of money. I guess my life purpose as an entrepreneur will be to create some platform where you can get help for free haha. Anyways.. anyone has any tips? This shit is heavy burden and it's been making my life harder and harder. ",2
t1d32o,soccer," Social anxiety is draining my life - Exhausted, depressed... :(. Please, if you have a few minutes... Hear me out.. I really have nobody to talk to about this so I am going to just spill this out here. Social anxiety pushed me away from people - but I am actually an extrovert. I won't dig more into that, but I love having a sense of belonging to some group - being able to hang out with people and meet new people. Being around socializing.. I love that shit man. My best memories are always with other people. But social anxiety made it really hard. To give a quick backstory: I played soccer at a professional club since I was 10 year old. I had to move to live with strangers - a different family in hundreds of miles away. It was my everything. At 16 I stopped socializing because I believed that ""working out hard while other people hanging out would make me best"" but I believe it actually ruined my ability to pick up social skills. Now, after 10 years I got played dirty and I kinda grew other passions, so I decided to focus on entrepreneurship / freelancing. One could say I failed in one thing and started pursuing the other. I had to move back to my parents, no car, no apartment - and no friends. I have no friends here and I am actually living in a village. The thing is, that I am of course 80% of my time in the next close city but there's really nothing to do. I know very few people - you could say they're friends / but we never go out together. I do everything alone.. Wait. I do only one thing besides working on my business and that's a gym. And man.. I am so anxious around people and overthinking fcking everything. I am so mad.. Today I was in the gym with a friend - and he knew other guy that joined our conversation and I felt so anxious that when he said some joke, I couldn't smile or even laugh. It's so stupid man but I couldn't.. I was probably so self-conscious that I just wasn't able to make a proper interaction man.. I am so exhausted of this fcking stupid social anxiety. How come they don't teach us this in a fkcing school?? Why they just tell you there are extroverts and introverts - but they don' tell you that it has nothing to do with how you feel about yourself and how to behave in social interactions. Fcking mad... So I bough a few books on social skills (Charisma is the myth and Dale Carnegie book) and I am ready to start practicing in daily interactions.. But I feel like I have bigger problem. This social anxiety... I tried ETF Tapping - I actually joined one online club where we were said we could overcome anxiety easily but it didn't seem to work for me - since it was probably only in different language. I tried sleep hypnosis - but again probably different language videos didn't help. I DIDN'T TRY therapist. But you know - living here in village gives you zero options without a car so my goal is to get a car, go live on my own and then get help but again.. I need help now it's so hard to think right now.. I really need help.. I don't know why I am writing this or even if someone will read this but yeah. I will appreciate any words or hear other people experiences.. This shit.. ahhh it fcking drains me ",2

48hd6s,"outside , outside , golf"," social anxiety with a girl at university. I am a 20 year old male 1st year student at university who is studying accounting. I am really struggling with making friends. In secondary school it is a lot easier to make friends because there are more group activities so is easy to make friends. In university, this is one of the first times I have been put in a situation to make friends from scratch and have bearly met anyone, at most only a few acquaintances. I feel like i don't relate to anyone. The only thing I have relationship wise is with a girl I met in a seminar at the start of the semester. She is attractive girl and was really warm and nice to me so I was instantly in to her. I've never had a girl like that around me before. After that, we always sat next to each other for that one seminar each week and enjoyed each other's company. As the weeks wait by, each lesson she would be really touchy by playfully punching my arm, leaning into me, putting her head on my shoulder and body language signs that she was into me. I was getting to the point where I would of asked her out around xmas time when for the first time we spent time with each other outside class having a coffee by ourselves and by spending that time with her, I was 99% sure she liked me. The opportunity never arose that day as there wasn't a right moment. After the xmas break, in our seminar class where we sit next to eachother, she started to bring her mates into that class where they'd sit together and I would near her but not next to her. It gave us less opportunity to talk and after a few weeks I was not getting the same energy from her. From her being really into me to barely interested at all. I have tried to be around her friends but it's hard for me to approach her with her friends with my SA and being nervous, shaky, racing heart and having a trembling voice in group situations and I don't want to come across bad so I avoid those types of things like going to the cafe with them etc and that's why I only spent time with her in that one seminar. The thought of me losing my chance with her was killing me inside which made my SA worse with me overthinking every little thing she would say to me and she would be the only thing I would think about all day. I know it's over the top to think like that about someone I spend one lesson with per week but I can't help it with this being the first girl I've genuinely like and who also liked me as well, also being a virgin so I don't want to make a mess of it. I came to the conclusion to try and ask her out after the seminar I sit with her. I asked her quietly ""can we talk to you for a minute after class"". She said okay but when the class was fininshed and she was staying behind, her friends asked ""why are you waiting"" to which she replied ""i need to talk to john(me) for a second"". Which really baited out what I was going to do because it only means one thing to talk to someone by themselves which threw me asking her out with her friends around the corner 5 yards away. So I ended up asking her in a really uncomfortable way if she wanted to go to the cinema to which she replied ""I need to clean my house this whole week but definitely another time"". I think this is just a nice way of saying no. It's been a week since this has happened and this has really put me down and overall really dislike what I am like around people because I am a decent person to be around once I am comfortable around people. I've struggled sleeping with me not being able to take that moment out of my head and cringing of the thought of that moment by embarrassing myself and messing up the only chance of having a potential girlfriend and some sort of social interaction. I don't have any friends or social life outside university, only play golf but that is a private hobby so this made the situation worse as I don't have anything to fall back on. I have avoided trying to bump into her because of the awkwardness and the fear of the looks I'll get from her friends with them knowing. Can anyone give me any advice on what I should do when I next see her next and their opinion on the whole situation with her, if you think there is any chance because I feel confused on how someone could suddenly lose interest. Thanks ",2
501b5k,paddleboarding," Advice for a very lonely guy[25]. I've looked around for a while on Google and Reddit for helpful advice, but nothing really matches my situation, so I decided to make a profile and see if you people have any advice. I'm not totally sure what my question is, but maybe you can help anyway. I will italicize parts of this post that are optional, but provide some background info for people who want it. I'm on my phone, so I apologize for any spelling/grammar errors. *ME: I'm a 25 year old male. I currently live at home with my parents but will be moving out next month into an apartment by myself. I'm a high school teacher with a good education and supportive, loving family. I'm very introverted (INTJ for those who like that stuff) and have always been slower at making friends. I don't currently have many. I've been in one, 4 month relationship that ended in June 2015, and that was the last time I had sex. I met her because the was the only single, attractive female that I knew through mutual friends. I, myself, am very average in every way.* I have a hard time making a post like this or complaining because there are SO many people in the world who have it SO much worse than me, but I'm very, very lonely. I usually spend days off and weekends sitting on the computer. I do have hobbies, but they are not ""social"" hobbies (gym, fishing, skiing, more recently stand-up paddleboarding. [these things can be altered to be ""social,"" but I somehow prevent myself from doing that, and generally like to be left alone while I'm doing them]). I live in the Midwest, so there's specific windows when I'm able to do each thing. Also, I'm not able to do these every day, or sometimes for a few weeks. My current friends have exactly zero interest in these things. *I've recently come to the realization that my friends are actually pretty terrible to me, and really only use me for their own needs. Maybe that's the way friendship always is, but I'm not exactly the most social person ever, so I might be difficult to hang out with. I am always the designated driver (started making them pay), and the butt of jokes because I'm not very respected (possibly for my lack of sports knowledge or experience with girls, the two most important things in life). Firing back in my own defense (even jokingly) results in ""you're a douchebag"" or ""you don't need to be mean."" In any case, I didn't come here to complain about them, but I'm just describing why I've decided to hang out with them less and less. Unfortunately, I don't have anyone to replace them with.* *My co workers are great people, but most are married or in relationships. I dated a teacher from another department a few times this past year before she lost interest for whatever reason and stopped texting me. They always ask when I'm going to find a girlfriend, but I don't have many opportunities to find one.* I try to accept any party or get-together invitations whenever I get them; I don't get them very often. When I do go, I struggle when talking to people or keeping the conversation flowing, especially with girls. I get into the mindset of, ""this person doesn't care what I'm talking about"" or ""I'm just rambling."" I know, it's a bad mindset to have, but I struggle with it nonetheless. The topics usually go to sports or something, but I just don't have anything to offer in that category. I don't watch much TV, and can't keep up with all of the ""stats"" and shit. A lot of advice I've already read is, ""just go find people you have things in common with."" To me, this is a complete mystery. It's almost like saying, ""stop being sick"" to someone who has a cold and expecting it to help. Even if I did find people who shared my hobbies, they are often much better at whatever it is, and they see me as some child who wants to follow along. I get the impression that anything I offer is looked over or seen as me being a ""know it all"" because the conversation quickly turns from there and never goes deep. I check my tone and wording, and I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. *I have a Tinder profile but don't get many matches (1-2 per month) I live near a city, so there's never a shortage of girls, but I have high standards, I think. It seems that most girls who fit my standards are not into me. Maybe I'm irrational in my standards: petite/slim/athletic (not chubby or ""curvy""), shorter than me (I'm 6'1""), preferably younger than me, and independent. My motto is ""don't hold anyone to standards you can't hold yourself too,"" but maybe I hold myself to standards that most people don't hold themselves to. In any case, matches I do get fizzle out; I'm not very flirty, sexual, or witty.* When social situations do arise, I find it difficult to engage in the conversation or stay focused. In many cases, I just want to go be alone. But I also crave that social contact and desire for acceptance! I feel like when I'm alone I want to be with people, and when I'm with people, I want to be alone. Like I said, I'm not totally sure what my question is. Maybe it's ""what am I doing wrong"" or maybe it's ""will you help me make friends."" Generally, my biggest statement here is ""help."" Despite the fact that I was tearing up through this whole post, I'm a grown ass man and I really shouldn't have to ask, but I just need some kind of guidance here. *TLDR: I'm a 25 year old male who is very lonely and struggles talking to people or making connections. Please help.* ",2

dhc3y5,"outside , outdoors"," How bad would you say my social anxiety is?. * When I have an event planned that requires social interaction (for example, literally anything from ordering food at a restaurant or giving a presentation to a group of people), I get mildly to very anxious even days before the event happens. Only once the event has passed I feel at peace again. I go over what I should say in advance, in my head. * I feel completely relaxed and fine around people I know, but around strangers I always get a little guarded. * I rarely if ever actually make any fuck ups when I get into an uncomfortable social situation, and afterwards it seems like it wasn't bad in retrospect, but it's the anticipation and ""build up"" to the event that kills me. From outside I seem totally calm and normal. I never have any panic attacks or anything extreme like that. * I find it much worse to initiate conversation with a stranger than have a stranger initiate conversation with me. * When I'm walking outdoors and see a stranger coming from the distance, I start looking around, trying to avoid eye contact, and start overthinking whether I should say hi or not, if I should look at them or not, etc. I get slightly anxious from this. * I'm very avoidant of situations where social interaction is mandatory, like shopping alone, ordering food, etc. Granted, I still live at home so it's not exactly required in my current situation. I don't have a job because of this, though. Never had a job before or shopped alone. * If I end up having a positive experience with a particular situation I feared beforehand (like going to a party of a family member who you barely know), the next times after that I will either fear that particular situation less or not at all. * I feel much more anxious around people my age or slightly younger than me than older people. I actually barely feel anxious around elders. * Some days I can have trouble even looking at people in videos or fictional media like games or anime. Not always though. Usually happens when I haven't seen anything like that in a while, repeated exposure cures it. ",2

I might start walking 1 day a week, then maybe I would increase the duration or distance of the walk, then I might start running or I’ll improve the days I workout. Slow improvements. Also, this doesn’t have to be at the gym you can start at home or drive to a park and do calisthenics . Remember this is going to be for you. You’re not going to improve for the girl. You do it because you like it. You’ll feel better. It makes you feel happy. Personally it helps me with my stress and anger/bitterness I use that as fuel to push my body. I would also work on getting a job, save up that money and maybe get a therapist in the future especially depending on costs. Here I gave you advice now it’s your choice, ignore it or take a leap and change for the better. ",2
e5gcsve,"running ,  tree"," Ok I’ll try to help you. (Long) Step 1. Delete Instagram. And don’t turn back it’s not worth it, your time is worth more and it’s definitely not worth looking over people’s pictures and then being depressed after. I myself, used to do this, I would stalk classmates that I never talked to or old friends, people that I used to know and I would be depressed and cry. Fuck that. Step 2. Figure out what you want to do. You need a goal. Something to start slow, you can’t just jump into something full blast and expect to keep up. So the good thing is you already have some ideas. You said, “I don’t have hobbies and don’t have the social life I want”. Ok, so this is the part where you will pick/decide on what to do. I would suggest on something easy first and then continue on your journey by adding more things. If you don’t have the social skills it’s going to be a long slump of improving and learning which might be demotivating especially if you have a bad experience. I would suggest getting a small hobby or goal. Something you do everyday or whatever schedule you set. Having a goal and completing that goal makes you feel fulfilled even if it’s not that big. Maybe something that you can do alone at first, then introduce people later on. I’ll try to give some suggestions for hobbies. Here’s some suggestions based on my subreddits: -Reading Books- r/52book r/BettermentBookClub r/bookclub r/books r/booksuggestions r/suggestmeabook r/whatsthatbook r/FreeEBOOKS -Exercise- r/bodyweightfitness r/EOOD (Recommended) r/Fitness r/flexibility r/gainit r/loseit r/homegym r/running r/C25K r/yoga -Meditation- The iOS apps HeadSpace &amp; Calm are good. r/Meditation r/Mindfulness r/Stoicism (kinda) r/zen r/zenhabits -Nutrition- r/1200isplenty r/Dryfasting r/fasting r/intermittentfasting r/keto r/MealPrepSunday r/nutrition r/Supplements r/Nootropics r/vegan -MISC- r/IWantToLearn r/Hobbies r/1DaySkill r/getdisciplined r/howtonotgiveafuck (lol) r/LearnUselessTalents r/podcasts r/selfimprovement r/wikipedia I could go on for ever, but I’ll lay it at that. If you still don’t have ideas you can pm and I can try to help. Now the point is there’s unlimited things in this world that you can do, from boxing to knitting to learning about cats to learning about murder mysteries. The problem is procrastination and not knowing what to do or how to start. Step 3. Getting Started. Ok so let’s say you picked reading as your hobby. Don’t expect your going to start reading everyday or even every other day. Go get a book, something interesting maybe the Harry Potter series. Go to this subreddit r/theXeffect and make a schedule on whatever you’re doing. Maybe you can try read 10 minutes a day or 20 minutes every other day. You could also just read 1 time a week and not specify the minutes. Whatever you choose. Just make it slow and doable. This sub has helped me brush my teeth everyday, I was real depressed and I stayed in bed all day, and didn’t have the greatest of hygiene. It was fixed with time. AND BOOM! You completed something and now you feel better about yourself :) I would suggest posting on their for motivation or get an accountability partner if you need it. You can do anything you want to if you put your mind to it. Also, if you need anymore resources Google is your friend &amp; YouTube videos/tutorials. Step 4. Go out and live your life! There’s so many interesting things to learn and people to meet. Just remember to start slow and work 1 day at a time. “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now” - Chinese proverb ",2
qzlpyt, walk," What does it mean when I'm too shy to ask my coworkers to take me home?. So I have a problem with buses around my workplace, and I was supposed to go home a few times pretty late but it meant I should wait an hour for the bus to arrive. A few of those times I decided I won't wait and walked for 20 minutes on foot in a dangerous path near the road where cars drive literally a few centimeters away from my body to get to another bus station, because I really needed to get home. The thought of asking someone to take me there never occurred to me(even though it's just a 2 minute ride). I honestly just gave excuses to myself as for why I shouldn't ask anyone. Because they are busy at work/because there's no one that can take me. I had absolutely no idea I could ask someone to take me there and go back to the workplace, and frankly I didn't even try, I just assumed nobody can. Even at times when we have to decide for 1 person to stay, I always feel guilty and selfish when I go home instead of someone else, although I do haves stuff to do at evening. I used to agree to stay but it meant I'd have to do this dangerous 20 minute walk to get to the bus station. I honestly hate that I do this, I make myself so small compared to other people that I'd rather suffer than ask someone to take just 4 minutes of their time to drive me somewhere. I was wondering why I had this fear. Maybe I was afraid of bothering them, or of them disliking me because of it, as irrational as I know it is. The fact that I'm a people pleaser really puts me at a tough spot and I hate being like this, I feel so submissive and quiet when I'm really not just because I'm afraid of bothering someone else/angering them/making them dislike me. I can't even confront people face to face, and in the rare occasions I try(usually it's with someone I'm comfortable with), I do it with zero confidence and I prepare to apologize once they react badly. I even have a hard time speaking clearly in front of people I'm uncomfortable around because I don't want to burden them and they end up not hearing me sometimes. I cant pretend it doesn't bother me when someone else is disappointed or disturbed by a decision that I have made, even if I try to take a risk and do it or ask for help. Does anyone have tips for how I can overcome people pleasing? How can I overcome being too shy to ask people for help? ",2
fvwgaf,lawn,"How’s your social anxiety during confrontations?. I had an incident yesterday where I was walking my dog through the neighborhood and she peed on the the edge of this house’s lawn. This lady comes out of her house and starts cursing at me, says she’s gonna beat my ass as she gets up in my face. There was some back and forth and then she said “I’m gonna shoot your dog.” At this point I was so angry I started recording with my phone and repeated what she said. Since I had her on video she backtracked and said “with a BB gun” and then she scurried back in her house. I was absolutely livid and that completely overrided any social anxiety. I did call the police to report the incident and that was hella anxiety inducing, my voice was all shaking talking on the phone. When the officer came to my house I had my mom with me while I was talking to him and that took some of the edge off How are you guys in these types of situation? I feel like while I’d normally be apprehensive about calling 911 my sheer anger helped me overcome that",2
8m7jv9,barbecue,"I feel like I'm not a good bf. Hello, fellow redditors! As you can imagine, I have some severe problems which make me believe I'm missing so much of my own life and kinda like throw away all the good stuff. I haven't had good experiences with psychologists, and that's why I hope someone here can help me \- at least a little bit. I'm 18 years old and don't have much friends. Actually I wouldn't even call them ""friends"", because they are either my girlfriend or colleagues. In school I always was kind of popular for some reason, but I never got to that point, where you are a real friend to someone, like doing stuff together, talking about everything and so on. I don’t even know why. Well \- I know one thing \- it was always my fault. Maybe even on purpose. It's not that people didn't want to be my friend! As long as I can remember \(still to this day\) I have some serious trust issues with everyone. If someone’s nice to me, I immediately suspect anything bad and try to think of reasons why they are nice to me and what they want. So I guess that’s the main reason I don’t really have friends. Life went on and everything is going very great for me. When I think about it, I don’t have any single problem right now \(apart from this topic of course\). Over the years I learned how to fake confidence, because it’s very important for my job. But apart from my workplace I’m still the anxious little boy that trusts no\-one. No\-one except for my girlfriend! I met her two months ago and there were some chemistry between us immediately. Luckily she did the whole stuff like asking me out first and when I’m with her I feel safe and secure, because I believe she likes me as I am. I don’t know why I think she couldn’t betray me so easily. Actually very naive of me when I think of it… Yesterday she got an invitation to a barbecue and told me I could come, too. She got invited by some people she also didn’t even know very well and apparently they said her boyfriend is also invited. First I said I would love to come, but I guess she knows me too well and noticed I don't really feel comfortable about it. So we agreed that it was totally okay for her to go alone, which I was very glad of. The problem was that a\) they were many people and b\) not even my gf knew them well. At the end of the evening they decided to go partying and from this point my mind went totally crazy and my heart pounded like shit. I imagined her being with other guys, being in dangerous situations, but most importantly it bugged me that I haven't been with her. Not because I'm jealous or I don't trust her, more because I felt like a really shitty boyfriend. I mean, I'm happy enough to have a girlfriend in my condition, but I could scare her away so easily with my problems. The thing is that is would never be possible for me to to a bar or a club, like almost everyone in my age does. Apart from the many people who are in these locations, I don't even get the point of buying overpriced alcohol and dancing in front of foreign people. Isn't that so embarrassing? I couldn't sleep the whole night, later her new\-found friends have brought her home \(which isn't actually my duty as a bf?\), and she always texted me, which was really cute from her, so at least now I don't have pictures of her being with other dudes in my mind anymore. But it really nerves me that I'm not capable of having fun and going out like a normal social human being! I want to spend time with her, maybe even with her friends \(btw, she wrote that I already might have fucked up with them, because apparently they expected me to come\) and also would like to experience the atmosphere of a club some time. But my anxiety just doesn't let me. In the moment I just fear losing her because of my problems, and I really don't want this to happen. She means so much to me. I wrote a long text to her, explaining how I feel and that I'm sorry I'm so special. I also asked why she's with me. She could easily find someone better, everyone's better than me as a boyfriend. Anyway \- Let's hope for a good response when she wakes up. I can imagine some of you are in a similar position and maybe even found a way to get over this. I would love to hear every single tip you have for me, because I really want to work on myself! Sorry for this wall of text and eventual grammar mistakes, English is not my native language. Thanks in advance!",2
5opswh,bicycle," I failed... again.... So today I wanted to go to the hairdresser and get a haircut. Nothing special just shorten my already way too messy hair. Either my father could have brought me there by car or I could have went there with my bicycle. Now guess what I ended up doing? Nothing! I stayed at home like so many other times in the past... I couldnt go to a place where i literally have to sit and wait. No action on my part is needed I just need to wait 20minutes until im done and I couldnt do it. I am really down at the moment because I thought I was on the right way (went shopping with family a few times, excercise, even started meditating) but I feel like im farther away then ever. What do you guys and girls do when you want to do something? How do you motivate yourself? I know positive thinking and to not overthink stuff is important but my body just autopilots and i get stomache aches. I just dont know what to do anymore ",2
7lulcj,"bicycle, soccer"," I feel like I need some advice to get over whatever anxiety I have left.. Hi. First post in this sub. So let me first begin by describing myself. I am a 22 year old guy. As a child I was always considered a shy boy. I didn't speak much when in a group. This made my family and relatives think I was an introvert and didn't have a lot friends (which honestly weirded me out a bit as I was often asked ""You don't have a lot of friends, do you?"" or ""How many friends do you have?""). However, in school, I always felt I was a different person somewhat. I did actually have friends. Not as many as someone not anxious or not shy, but I always put myself around my friends when in school. So anyway, fast forward a few years to the last year in my school, I finally started talking with girls of my class. So by now you may have figured I was less shy than before. But still a lot shy. Around this time you would expect a guy to hang out with his friends all the time. *I believe I low key always wanted that.* However, I lived some 6 miles from my school and I had no bicycle or motor vehicle to travel that far every day (as most of my school friends lived near the school). So I ended up staying at home all day and playing video games. With girls (and now women), I had it worse. Till about my 11th grade, I didnt speak to a lot of girls. Barely if any. In my 11th grade, I started making a few girl friends but I never talked to them as much as my guy friends. We hung out like once or twice but once school was over I couldnt meet them as often and didn't text them a lot either. Moving on to relationships, the first true crush I had was in 7th grade I believe. She lived close to me and went to school in the same bus. I first texted her on social media and we got to talking. I believe we became ""social media"" friends but I never really talked to her in person because I was afraid of I dont know what. She eventually left my school and I never really got to talk to her again. The second crush I had was the time I started approaching girls. I still didnt talk as much as a normal guy would but I met this girl in my class. We sat next to each other waiting for our class to begin. 15 minutes of silence later I asked for the time or something. We started talking and moved on to texting. This time I spoke in person more than last time (but again, not as much as a normal person would). We became really good friends. She suddenly disappeared so that was over. **This was my school life** Now comes my recent university life. I was more outgoing now that I had to stay in my university for atleast 8 hours a day. My life was definitely happier (since surprise, I am actually an extrovert). I was still a bit shy but I no longer was scared of casual group gatherings. In fact, I enjoyed those. Life still sucked past 5 PM because I still did not have a mode of transport to travel 8 miles everyday. But it was better than before. Here I met my third crush. She is an introvert and had an attitude. I could now talk to women better (again, not as good as a normal guy) but something about her made me very nervous. I tried talking to her for 2 years, couldn't. In my 3rd year was when I started talking to her properly. But she never showed interest in knowing me so I eventually lost interest in her and generally avoid her. And this was my history of my anxiety. I finished my 4 years in the university yesterday. About six months ago I was at my absolute worst. I still couldnt hang out with my friends after 5 PM. I had to stay home after that and I started getting depressed and had negative thoughts. Anxiety peaked. Thats when my father said something to my younger sister, you and your mother are the only extroverts in our house. Something did not feel right. I knew the actual meaning of both the terms, and I didnt feel like an introvert that my father labelled me. I soon learned that I am actually an extrovert, but I had social anxiety. Thats when I first came across the term. Realising that I had social anxiety helped me a lot to fight it. I suddenly had my anxiety decreased a lot. I now make friends VERY easily. I have made more friends in the past 6 months than I had made in the past 4 years. Obviously, in situations I realised that my fears were irrational. However, I haven't been completely been able to overcome it. I will give some instances. &gt;**1** I am still not great at talking with women. I have always felt that I am a sub-human. I think that I am not good looking (even though I have been told otherwise), I will bore them if I talk to them which means I can't make the first move ever, or that something about me will repel any potential dates I could have. &gt;**2** My family has been broke for the past 4 years. My (fairly) large friend circle asks me to hang out. One friend circle spends a lot of money so I haven't hanged out with them in about 2-3 years. I feel bad about it but for some reason I can't tell them that I am broke as fuck. I can't afford to go to a restaurant or coffee place every other day and have some A grade shit. They feel that I don't think them as friends anymore. And my anxiety makes me feel really bad about it. &gt;**3** Sometimes I feel truly confident. Very confident in fact. In that state sometimes I get the job done whatever it may be, but sometimes when the work actually comes, I panic and stop myself from doing the work or avoid the public gathering. I realise that my fear is irrational but it just consumes me. &gt;**4** Sports. As I said, anxiety and shyness are truly fucking terrible. I never was able to play sports for long because I felt I sucked and everyone hated me for that. Today as I am less anxious and more interested in sports, I feel like playing a soccer, but most of my friends have been playing (with people) for several years and they are atleast good at it. I know I can't keep up with them and honestly it doesnt matter because at this age, they aren't going to make it to the international leagues either. But for some reason, I fear being judged still. &gt;**5** I made a few girl friends over the years now but I still can't talk to them as much because I feel I will be boring to them. My anxiety ruins my friendships with them. One of the main reason why I truly want to get over my anxiety. When I talk to them I realise that these girls consider me a friend, but I can't just speak with them properly and maintain that friendship. In January, I plan on started MMA classes since I learned that physical fitness and exercise helps in you confidence, a lot. But I want some other advises that can make me get over my anxiety completely. My life would be so much better if I do, so please help. Thank you ",2

I've worked a lot as a translator and as a graphic but since my computer died i can't do that anymore. Also I'm broke and I have a dog who is sick and you know,i need money. I've never worked outsite my house. I know it's bad i really know that. I suffer from depression,panic attacks and social anxiety and sometimes the panic attacks get really bad at the point I pass out. It's been this way for years and I go to a therapist once a week but i never got better and I can't afford to go to someone else. So,tomorrow I hava a job interview. There's this bar on the beach and they need a waitress who can speak a few languages. I can speak fluently italian,english and french,a little bit of german and swedish so i know i could get the job. But right now I'm panicking so much because I've never done a job like this,and it would mean to stay in contact with other people and look happy and talk and even thinking about doing it makes me feel horrible. Also I can't stop thinking about how it would be if I screw up a order and I can feel a panic attack coming soon and I just don't know what to do. ",2
b1wlb8,"Outside , outside , bicycle"," I don't know how to approach this... So, this is a bit complicated.I'm a 19 y/o guy studying at university at the moment. This is my third year in uni, 2nd in my current study programme (I quit my first study on a different uni). I haven't really made any real friendships/connections from uni, although I often work with one person I can get along with very well. Outside of studying we don't really do anything outside of uni.In the first year at the other uni, I didn't have any friends except my cousin with whom I often play games via Discord and formerly Teamspeak. When I was in high school, I didn't have any friends. I tried to connect with other people, but I was too anxious. The 6 years I was in high school was definitely the worst time of my life. Especially in the lunch breaks I felt horrible, I often went home on my bicycle, even though it took up a large part of the break time. I did this because I did't know where to sit (our school was horribly crowded in the breaks, there weren't even enough tables). I also feared sitting with my classmates, this fear grew stronger in the later years. Back to my cousin, he plays an important role in my current social life. He was in a different high school, and I was 2 years ahead of him. Around 2014-15 we started gaming via Teamspeak, which was a big relief for me, as I didn't have any other way to socialize with people. After a while, a few classmates of his also joined, and ever since we still talk via Discord all the time. Currently it's my cousin, my brother (he was 2 grades lower at my high school, I will explain his role in the story below) and two friends of my cousin (classmates) which are in Discord all the time, and we are basically friends. When I quit my first year on uni halfway through, I started working at a supermarket for a while before starting my next study. While working there, I saw my cousin's classmates for the first time, which was a bit awkward, but nothing too bad. It was nice seeing them irl for the first time. Now my brother. He is 1 year younger than me, and was 2 grades below me. He did have some friends, but one best friend which he still is. Since around 2016, when I was in my last year, he went to the disco/club (not sure what to call it, it's basically an empty hall packed with people where dance/big room house is played by a DJ) with my cousin and some other friends, and he quickly made friends with those people (including the Teamspeak/Discord group). I forgot the order in which the connections grew, but it's not that important. Back to today, what it comes down to is that my brother, his friend, and the friend group of my cousin (and kinda me, limited to Discord) became one big friend group. For like 2 years now, they go the the club almost every Saturday or Friday night. And I? I never went to a club even once. I'm too socially anxious. In the beginning I was not interested in night-life, however, after a while I regret never going. It would have been a great way to get to know the friend group better.I feel like I'm too late at this point in time. Every time they go out, they send video's and pictures on our Snapchat group chat, and it makes me feel sick in the stomach to see them having fun, while I'm at home doing nothing. Aside from going to the club, they do a lot more fun things together like going on a vacation to Spain, and this year to Albufeira, or going to birthday parties or other random parties from people I don't even know. I feel horrible to be disconnected from those events, and the fact that they have many more friends than me. The problem I have is that I don't how to get involved in those social activities. I'm extremely anxious to go to the club with them, especially because they have done it a myriad of times, while I have never been to the club. A few times my cousin has asked me to join, but I said no because I was too anxious. I instantly regret it, but didn't do anything about it. After all this time I fear to go with them, I don't how to behave at the club, and them having all this 'experience' makes it even worse.The fact that my brother is involved in all these social events makes it extra hard for me, it makes me feel like an outcast. I've always portrayed myself to my brother as someone who doesn't like parties and that kind of stuff. I feel like I need to break this image of myself from my brother and my cousin. I feel like it would've been a lot easier if my brother wasn't involved in this group of friends. I would greatly appreciate if someone can help me break the status quo and get more connected with my friends. The greatest fear that I need to break is going to the club with them, which feels like a massive threshold.Maybe someone has been through something similar, and can share his or her experience. ",2
57jul7,"benches, outside "," I just got back from my first date ever.. I am 20 years old and male. Like many of you my social anxiety has made me shy away from women and dating. A couple months ago I met a girl a couple years older than me that works at my mom's workplace. For a long time I didn't reach out to her out of fear of the outcome, as well as self destructive thoughts: ""she's too good for me"" ""It's been too long. It would be wierd now"". I got myself into a better place mentally and finally realized I have nothing to lose by trying. I texted her saying I would like to get to know her better and I asked if she wanted to get coffee with me. She agreed and we planned a time. Getting that message saying she did want to go out with me made me the happiest I have felt in awhile. It was almost like a drug. I read the message and a wave of happiness washed over me and suddenly I got the motivation to just do something. So I did some exercising which I have a lot of trouble making myself do. A few days later she told me she was going to meet a (female) friend afterward to eat and asked if I wanted to join them after the two of us got coffee. I agreed. initally I was really excited, but as the day approached that excitement was replaced with anxiety. About 30 minutes before my stomach was in knots. On the drive there I was doing deep breathing exercises to keep myself from freaking out. I was early so I was in my car repeating to myself: ""you can do this"" ""She is just a regular person"" ""She is going to be nervous too"" Then I saw her walk into the coffee shop. ""This is it"" I told myself. I got out and walked in. I saw her and we said hello and exchanged pleasantries. We ordered and she said she would pay for herself. I said I was happy to get it for her, but I did not insist and I let her pay for herself. We walked out to the benches outside and talked for awhile. I had done lots of research on first date conversation to prepare myself. We talked about her job, our pets and my job. We both went to the same university, but at different times. We both dropped out. That created quite a bit of conversation topics. We even got off on a political discussion somehow. This actually worked out well since we have similar views on the subject. Afterward we walked to the restaurant which was just down the road and met her friend. It was actually really nice having her friend there. It took some of the pressure off me to keep conversation going. Again we all paid for our own food, but I did offer to take care of the appetizer we all shared and I did. Once the night was over her friend left and just me and her walked together until we got to my car. We said goodnight and she said she would like to see more of me. I said I wanted to see her again as well and we went our separate ways. I feel so accomplished. I kicked my anxiety in the nads and did something that makes even a normal person nervous. Sure I was a little quiet and I didn't say a whole whole lot about myself. Still I'm glad I got the chance to get to know her and to my suprise I actually had quite a bit of fun. ",2
ahiu7x,"bicycle, bike, bike, bike, bicycle, bicycle, bicycle"," bicycle fightig. So I went into the grocery store tonight on my bike and this girl employee says nice bike. I fumble for the words to say with this unexpected remark, emitting something that sounds alien. Then after grading a few items I make my way to the checker...same girl. She says something real fast that I don't comprehend until a few minutes later...""I took your bike"" Then she notices my knuckle that got a cut early and says ""what happened to your knuckle"" I fumble for the words to say and spit out ""bicycle fighting"", she repeats what I said with the most perplexed look and I turn red and scurry out the door.

5pg185,"run , basketball"," It's my birthday today and I hate the trajectory my life is taking.. I just turned twenty 3 hours ago and am no longer a teenager. I have noticed that my life trajectory is heavily sloping downwards. I consider myself to have two real friends, both who are on the other side of the US going to a different University so I will be spending it alone with my parents (I have never had a conversation with them longer than 5 minutes because of a serious language barrier). Also my sister and I do not get along at all, so I have no strong familial connections. I withdrew from church when I was 16 because I lost my faith, and only now realize that I lost so many genuine friends along with it. I go to my state university, so I see them around but I actively avoid them due to my SA. They invite me on Facebook to church events but I always decline. And I always worry about how many people will post Hbd to my Facebook wall. I probably average 8-12 a year, and it always makes me sad when I see some getting 60+. I've never had a girlfriend or even a female friend I would consider close. I don't consider myself to be attractive, but I definitely don't think I'm unattractive. I am more on the lean side because I run and play basketball. In eigth grade (before puberty really hit me and developed my SA), I remember heavily flirting with this cute girl in 7th grade and developed a strong bond. Then I didn't see her for a year cause I went to high school (9th grade) and she was in 8th grade. I'll never forget the moment the year after when she came up to me (when I was 10th grade and she was 9th grade) and said hi all excitedly, and I pretended that I barely knew her because I didn't know how to handle the situation and gave her a very uninterested response even though I still liked her. Then when I was in senior year of high school, she became my physics AP partner by some random luck and I felt so awkward every single day. She eventually ended up dating one of my ""friends"" which killed me inside. This may sound pathetic but I still like her a lot and sometimes fantasize about her in my dreams (like what it would be like to spend a day with her at the county fair). I realize this is unhealthy but I can't help it All the current friends I have are stoners and druggies. I experimented heavily with weed in senior year, and eventually everyone in my social group in high school smoked weed constantly including me. I believe there's nothing wrong with weed, but I sort of had a revelation in sophomore year of college that I didn't want to be a druggie (they started doing shit like xanax, Molly, oxy, lsd, whippets, and I just didn't want to associate with them), so I stopped hanging out with them. And college. Oh boy. I thought this would be where my life would change for the better. Nope, I'm still a shitty human being with zero social skills and it's tough making friends as a shitty human being with zero social skills. I went to one party and ended up puking everywhere and I try to repress that memory. I also have zero hobbies besides video games. I always thought at least I was smart, but college sure proved me wrong (I always score average on exams now). I'm struggling to maintain my scholarship (I need a cumulative 3.2 and I have a 3.25 right now) So here I am. A little drunk in my bed on my phone, nowhere near close to feeling sleepy. I really just wanted to rant. My social anxiety for sure caused my depression since 12th grade, and freshmen year of college I went through some heavy suicidal thoughts. At least now they aren't as frequent and don't hit as hard sophomore year. Basically, I fail at living life. I wish you all eventually find happiness if you're struggling with it, and I hope we are all able to overcome our social anxiety/depression one day. Edit: holy shit I did not realize I wrote this much. I'll probably end up deleting this when I wake up tomorrow morning anyways ",2
e3hnhpf,"basketball, baseball "," that's true and over the summer I came to that realization as well. but having social anxiety I just can't seem to do it. I know it sounds like making excuses, but that's just my reality. I have no friends here and doing things alone is awful with social anxiety. so I'm constantly not doing anything even to follow my own path because of the interactions I would have to endure. and the worst thing about it, is that I'm 6'6"" and a black male. that makes it so much worse I can't connect with anyone. I can talk to people about sports or little stupid small talk subjects, but that's only good for a period of time. I'm into politics, an atheist, and very intelligent. having to open up to people I don't know very well just seems impossible. like who's going to be accepting of a black atheist in America? especially other blacks who are most likely Christian or religious. or like who wants to talk about politics, especially other African Americans at 20 years old. I've always had these expectations of me because of how I look, ""oh you must play basketball"" can't imagine how many times I had to hear that. like no, I grew up playing baseball and football I would appreciate people to stop making prejudgments about me because of how I look. just makes me want to end it. then I'm not into anime like other people my age, especially other African Americans. I have grown and matured past that, I used to like it when I was in 4th grade. now I just can't connect with people on any level. ",2

Right now I went with my friends to the beach for spring break and there are 3 different people here that I went to high school with and knew kinda well. I told my friends with me I saw on a Facebook post that they were here and they told me to message them to see if we could hang out with them and their sorority.

e4oer56,outside,"I was like that when I was a teen. I never really went outside to play or had people over for sleepovers. Never really went to parties or got laid (until college) or drank or did drugs. Social media is so toxic. You shouldn’t compare your life to what people are doing, because you’re different and you should go at the pace you’re comfortable with and can go (not everyone has the money to go out everyday for example). It may not seem like it now, but you have a lot ahead of you, trust me. Now I’m 22, turning 23. I got my first job at 21 (unlike my friends who had jobs at 16) and that helped me out of my bubble. With the money, I’ve gone out to bars, went to clubs, parties, traveled, found new restaurants, met new people, found a passion, tried new things. I’m currently looking to go to my very first concert actually. These teens that go to parties and drink and look like they’re having the time of their lives are living a fantasy. They only do it for social media, to fill their insecurities. They use someone else’s money to seem like they’re “living” and you’re not. But life’s more than social media, really living is more than just parties and drinking. It’s finding yourself through your own capabilities and being surrounded by positivity. You like netflix and gaming? Try your best to find people who also like it, make new friends, hang out, and it’ll open a gateway of new things to try. There’s nothing wrong with your interests, don’t compare yourself to others because society deems it “wrong” somehow.",2

He threw it on the ground as I scooped my arms up in the air with nothing in my hands, literally I was probably 5 feet away when I scooped up my arms. So embarrassing, *everyone* started laughing hysterically and I felt like fucking dying.

I'd pick up their car, get some fast food and just chill out somewhere like a beach until my fake class ended and head back home. My social anxiety, depression and weight skyrocketed during that period and the only reason I stopped was because I was too tired to fake it anymore. The truth of course shattered my parents, particularly my mom. Through tears they forced themselves to kick me out of the house so that I'd ""grow up"". Mostly through luck other people's pity I managed to pick myself up and survive. I wish I had gone to a therapist back when I was 18 so that I could spare my parents that heartache.

This is in Portugal and as it is a very religious country there are many religious parties and this year on the 13th of August we went to play in a small village 3 hours away from my home city, we would sleep in people's houses. We had played and it was 2 AM now and every band member was dancing with tons of other people to a concert in the village's center. My friends and I had gone on a walk through the village and the we went to the concert again. I had barely slept the night before and I had drank coffee, and when you are 15 and this is really shit. So, a major dance comes up and every bamd member joins, I was in the bench watching the concert and my friends were too. The invited me but I was really afraud of going. I had 2 choices, go dance with them and feeling anxious being around so many people or I could do the worst and that was what I choose. I sat in the bench and declined going to dance whike everyone was dancing, they found this weird ofc and they approached me and asked what was wring with me, I got even more anxious and more peoole came up to me making me the centre of attentions. I told them I was tired and needed to sleep, the woman brought me to her home where I was staying, while everyone was dancing and partying.

eacyld8,outside,"I feel you, it could've been me writing this story. They say that our anxiety causes up to make stupid decisions but I had a similar situation to yours and took the alternate route. I was around 14 at the time. My mum dropped me off at the bank to do a transaction that takes about half an hour to process while she went to the supermarket next door to shop. It took about an hour to get to a teller and finish the transaction then I called my mum to let her know I was finished. She wouldn't answer. It was raining outside so I just decided to sit back down in the waiting area figuring she would call me when she's ready. Over the next hour, the waiting area clears and the tellers keep glancing at me probably wondering why I was loitering. I lean back and doze off. I feel a tap on my leg and open my eyes to see a manager and security guard in front of me. The manager asks if I need help with something and I say no that I'm just waiting on my mum to pick me up. She gives me an odd look and says okay and nods to the security guard. I check my phone and realise I've been sleeping for 30 minutes. Before I can decide what I'm going to do I get a call. It's my dad. He sounds angry and asks where I am. I tell him I'm in the bank waiting for mum to come back for me. He then tells me that someone in the bank called and told him that I was there sleeping in the waiting area well after I had finished my business with the bank. He said I looked like an idiot just sitting there. After he hangs up, I look around and see the tellers and security guards staring at me again; they probably heard my conversation. I pack up and go outside and stand behind a column so no one in the bank could see me waiting. About 20 minutes later my mum pulls up and I get in the car. She asks how long I've been waiting and then why I hadn't just gone to the supermarket when I finished. I don't know. I was so embarrassed by the whole situation. I never went back to that branch but after it closed, some of the staff were moved to the other branch I used in order to avoid ever seeing those people again. It'd be another hour to find the next closest branch so I've been stuck seeing these people since.",2

Both my parents were protective but especially my mom. I never learned to swim because she has a fear of water. I couldn’t drive half a mile down the street to get gas without her with me in the car and that was when i was approaching 18 just about to get my license after years of refusing to drive with me. I had never gone to any sort of social event as a child without her there and i was 17 before i ever even got my hair cut without her there (to this day i can’t socialize with barbers). Even on breaks while I’m in college i can’t link up with high school friends to hang out without her trying to guilt trip me for not giving her every single detail of what was planned so yeah there’s probably truth there.

I left my room, went outside and felt the need to finally greet my neighbor first and actually did some small talk! I felt like going outside and doing things and I did. It was a really weird feeling that stayed with me for at least a week. It was so intense that at some point I started becoming scared of my own self like ""This is totally not like me, what is happening to me, why do I feel like this?"", ""What if I suddenly snap out of this"", etc... As the days passed, the feeling started to fade away and I was slowly reverting back to my old self. About a month or two later I decided to try it again but that time it wasn't as powerful as before. I got a little boost for the day and was back to my old self.

eeljxq0,outside," I’ve always experienced this sensation of being bullied by my friends or random people when in public cause they always gave me this weird look. I think in the moment of socializing with your friends if they tend to laugh randomly you’ve failed to grasp the joke that someone inherently made which may or may not be at you. I feel like I sometimes go into my own bubble whenever I’m outside and only notice things like my friends all of a sudden laughing, etc. In a situation where a inside joke is made and you are left on the outside it’s hard to decide if you missed out or basically am a target. I think it’s up to how much you trust each person as «friends» to let yourself be more comfortable in those situations. For example I used to have these situations a lot. But since I’ve learnt that my friends wouldn’t want to intentionally harm me by saying something bad or physically for that matter. I still struggle to accept «friendly banter» like jokes directed towards you as I sometimes take it too personal and start getting moody cause of it. I am accepting over the fact that they never mean it in a harmful way which helps me to recover more as I’ve never really mentioned my depression or social anxiety to them. So it’s only fair that they treat me normally and poke some fun at me sometimes. In the end I believe it’s up to how much you trust each friend to start and feel more comfortable during these situations. Best of luck as I know it’s not easy and I don’t really know how your friends act towards you or how the jokes feel as I don’t know the situation. So my answer is based of the knowledge you’ve given me about your situation. ",2
