            "Texto: For me it also tends to be easier to walk up to a person in my school when there is 1 person rather than 2,3 or 5 people there.. I even feel anxious when I am just walking around and thinking that people are laughing at me when I can't know if they laughed at me or something else.. How can I walk up to someone in my school and start a conversation with them/maybe befriend them... My lack of friends is really putting me down and the only solution I know is to stay home and never go outside to look at people my age.. So like every time I want to walk up to someone I get this weird feeling in my stomach or somewhere around there and it usually happens when I am anxious about something so that's how I know I have social anxiety and also because I ALWAYS seem to overthink about how to start a conversation before walking to someone and I just think I may annoy them or its not the right time or I don't have enough time to talk to them because in school breaks there is 5-10 minute breaks so I feel like we won't have enough time to introduce myself and it would be akward I also feel like that when I leave the school and want to talk to someone as if its not the right time and place to talk to someone.. So I really could just wish I could take like a magic pill that would make me stop feeling worried about how other people would perceive me if I walked up to them.\n",

For the summer I decided to do a study abroad in China. As part of the summer program, I was required to live with a host family on the weekends. This of corse made my social anxiety act up something nasty, that is until the host family father brought me along to drink with his buddies. Now, being a straight laced hermit in the States, you can infer I've never drank before. Sitting on a river side eating smoking and drinking with a bunch of middle aged Chinese dudes, like cured me of my anxiety. Too bad I can't do this back in the States, guess my anxiety will come back upon returning home.\n",

I just realised this today and I am not sure it applies to everyone with social anxiety. However, I think that my severe social anxiety stems from being WAY too hard on myself. I just constantly scrutinise/ ridicule myself, find reasons why I am not good enough. From my looks to my personality etc. It can be an extremely negative thing in these circumstances, but also can be positive in some situations. I am a EXTREMELY harsh on myself when it comes to things like: gaming, the gym and any competitive settings and I think this has somewhat of a positive impact (on performance at least). For example, my gym has a competition on the rowing machine where you have to row 1000m in the fastest time possible. I tried this yesterday and placed second in my gym (5 seconds behind 1st place). A normal person would be happy with their performance and think that 2nd was good enough. However, I was distraught, extremely disappointed in myself. I don't even train rowing directly, I do a lot of weightlifting in the gym to strengthen my back, biceps, legs etc. which all help in rowing, but up until this point I had never even been on a rowing machine (subtle brag l000l). But I think that this irrational self-hatred and intense criticism is a cause, or at least one of the causes of social anxiety. We convince ourselves that we are not good enough, that we are somehow less worthy than others. This manifests itself and creates such a negative self image. Just an observation, does anyone else experience this?\n",

I just found (THIS IS MY VERY SUBJECTIVE, PERSONAL OPINION), that the MORE i go outside, the more i am happy, productive, outgoing, higher self-esteem and the more i stay home and play video games, do nothing, the more i develop crazy thoughts, neurotic behaviors, compulsive drives, OCD, ADD, you name it..... Furthermore, i've also tried a lot of challenges ranging from approaching random people on the street, NoFap (120 days), to going to the gym every day.. I WASN'T LIKE THIS BEFORE!

            "Texto:  Some advice. Ask yourself, why am I really anxious? Why does it matter what people think of me? The truth is that this is your life and yours only. There is no shame in embracing who are and stepping out into the world, cause everyone is in this thing together. It doesn't matter what people think of you because their thoughts about you shouldn't and don't affect your life. Having anxiety can often make someone judging or staring at you feel the same as having a gun held to your head. In truth, everyone has their own thoughts, looks different and has their own opinions. So why should you have to suppress yourseld at the will of others who are just as human as you? Being judged by others doesn't actually affect your life, you just perceive it that way. Trying to be a people pleaser or being scared of others judgement will only lead you to continually seeking validation externally. In reality, you and how you feel about yourself is all that matters. I therapist recently gave me a helpful analogy: You have to treat life as a playground rather than a high wire. On a playground, the decisions you make don't have real implications and there is room for mistakes, but also enjoyment. Having anxiety is like living life on a hire wire. You tread carefully and over analyse every decision you make, leaving no room to actually enjoy life. Just do you. Cause that's all that matters! \n",

When I told them I lied and said my friend was driving when it happened and they believed me and after I was a little better and could walk a little bit more they wouldn't let me hang out with the friend it happened with because they blame him for it which is pretty much why he's no longer my best friend and we just don't talk anymore..

I did get back into skating and hockey, and several years later, when I was probably around 16, I was in a hockey tournament and it happened once again but this time it was while playing on the rink.. I rushed off the rink super fast as I felt nervous and it took me several minutes of sitting down in a seat and relaxing until it went away.. As I look back on different situations in my life where I got anxious, nervous, and/or got this ‘numb-type feeling’ that overtook my body and my surroundings felt off, it was typically while skating, playing hockey, driving in a vehicle, being around a large crowd of people like in a sports arena, or anxiousness led to it and it took a little while to relax and for the sensation to go away.. For all my life, I’ve felt wobbling and rocking sensations (like I’m on a boat) even while sitting still.. There was one time, when I was around maybe 10-12 years old, I was skating around the rink and all of a sudden got this super numb feeling from head to toe, almost a light-headed feeling, where everything around me felt ‘off’.. Even though I loved skating and hockey more than anything, I basically had to be forced to go back and start skating again, as I was too afraid that it would happen again.. This feeling I got while playing hockey or skating ultimately led me to quitting the sport I love.. I recently read some research on the vestibular system and its relation to anxiety, agoraphobia, balance and motion, and makes me wonder if there is something potentially wrong with that.\n",

Im 23 yr old male who has two younger sisters, one that is 21 and another that is currently 15. Now this is all relative to the youngest one which im trying to help or do my best to understand what she is going through to maybe improve or give her some guidance on getting through things The youngest sister has social anxiety. She sometimes cant do some tasks which i would consider a breeze and not a worry to me but to her it builds into a panic attack and ends in a hyperventilating breakdown. Her and I are very close and I do my best to try and give her advice from my perspective but im afraid my advice may not work as well due to me being a polar opposite to her. I was looking for some advice to pass on from some of you guys and gals to maybe give to her. She has trouble even wanting to wake up or show up to school due to being so nervous or worrying about what others may think, she cant talk to someone in the hall way and ask for even the time without panicking. I know this load of text probably isnt easy to read as its alot of thoughts at once but i really wanna help her. I dont wanna see my youngest sister have to go through such a hard time all the time So my resolution is that im open to any words or advice i can give her from people who suffer from this, because it just seems like my advice may not be striking in the right areas for her or maybe even some ways to cope with it or ways to improve on it that i can teach her Thank you very much for reading this and I'm happy to hear from anyone about ways i can help her \n",

I became good friends with one of the members of the group, Alan, who is a retired photographer and artist and as he is now in his mid 70's he enjoys keeping fit and socialising with the walking group.. Fast forward 2 weeks I woke up early on a sunny, crisp Saturday Autumn morning and made the short drive over to Alan's house for the plaster cast to be made.. As I had been on Furlough for the past few months (now back at work!) I had been looking through old photos and files and thought that I would share my personal experience of stepping way out of my comfort zone and overcoming a mountain of anxiety that I have experienced for most of my life.. To set some background, approximately 5 years ago I joined a local walking group within our village who meet up every Sunday to go for a long walk (with a nice pub stop at the end!).\n",

He may have made a comment about your height but it really speaks volumes about his own insecurities. I work with a person who is 5ft 3, a whole foot and an inch shorter than me, and I honestly don't even notice it until she says something. While I'm sure it feels like people aren't taking you seriously, or like it sets you back, to other people your height is not something they will really think about. How big or small you are doesn't really play a part in your relationship with others unless there's a physical component anyway, and in most cases being smaller as a female is actually in your favour. Especially when boys make comments please try remember that they were once learning how to tell a girl they were interested by pushing her over in the playground. A lot of people lack tact, and they may just be trying to get your attention by being mean because they want your attention on them. \n",

            "Texto:  Possible social anxiety?. I am not looking to be diagnosed by a complete stranger but I just want an opinion by someone with SAD because I've been really confused. First of all, not only do I get anxious talking to people I don't know well but I often feel anxious around my friends. Anytime my two closest friends ask to facetime I get so so anxious that sometimes I try to find any excuse to get out of calling them (which I always feel bad for) and then when I do facetime with them I get all sweaty and shaky. And it's the same situation for when my friends ask to hangout in person. I think the main reason is beacuse I hate those awkward pauses in a conversation and I feel like most times I have no idea what to talk about. Secondly, my self esteem isn't great. I often catch myself comparing myself to others. It's espscially when I'm at school and it feels like people are staring at me. I'm always worried about how I look and how I act. And if none of my friends are in my class I can't make converstaion with other people which is the worst especially when I have to do group work or group presentations. Like I said before my self esteem is bad which means that I always put myself down. For exemple, if I answer a question wrong in class I say \"I hate myself\" or \"I'm so dumb\" repeatedly in my head. And I find that I dig my nails in my palms in these kind of situation where I'm anxious. No, not even close to point where they bleed like Betty from Riverdale. It's just slightly but still I thought it was important to mention. Lastly, lately I've been feeling really unmotivated and useless. Which is most likely not related to what I think is my social anxiety. I don't have the motivation to exercise, to do homework, to make food, basically anything. And I know it's not healthy physically and mentally and I even feel guilty about doing nothing all day but I just have no motivation to do anything about it. I'm even scared to post this... I feel like even if this is a social anxiety subreddit that maybe people are going to judge me for digging my nails in my palm or for not even wanting to hangout with my closest friends. I don't expect anyone to reply and if you don't want to that's totally fine but if you do thank you so much &lt;3 \n",

With your current philosophy \"I'm a shitty worthless person who can't do anything on their own. I need this man's love or else I can't bear to live. Then I'll truly be a shit.\" you're going to be anxious all the time because he might stop loving you. Whenever he disapproves of what you're doing, you'll feel like shit. You'll have to bend over backwards for him even you don't want to for otherwise he might leave you. How can you gaurantee that he'll love you in two seconds? In a week? A month? A sandy foundation indeed. Not very healthy at all. Feeling Good by David Burns is a fantastic book that teaches cognitive behavioural therapy and it has a great chapter on why love is not a need and how to overcome neediness and live a more emotionally independant life.

            "Texto: Showing affection in public. On Friday, November 17th, I confessed my undying love to my closest friend who has helped me through the hardest years of my life. And he loves me back just as much. The kind of love that comes only once in a lifetime. We spent the whole weekend fantasizing about our future together and how much we've helped each other over the past year. Today was the first day we saw each other since Friday. And it was... a combination of awkward and amazing. The whole bus ride (which is about an hour long), was largely silent say for a few sentences to each other. We could feel the butterflies but we couldn't really act on them. The whole day was largely this way. For lack of a better term I'm largely the \"dominant\" one in the relationship. However, this is the first relationship I've ever been in, and I'm finding it really REALLY hard to find ways to show my unending oceans of love, at least in public. The whole day we're around each other is in public. On the bus, in classes, in the hallway. Everywhere we go we have people around us. So, I ask to any of you out there, do you have any tips or pointers to get past the social anxiety and just focus on the person I want to be with forever? I'm normally very quiet and I want to break this shell. Thank you.\n",

I'm the same, there's lots of us out there. It's hard to explain to people that don't suffer from anxiety and depression. The two work together to create an extremely debilitating condition that is sometimes, without help, too much for our will to overcome. You have to understand it's not YOU that's the problem, it's this illness that wants nothing but to harm you. And you have to fight it with all you've got. If you sulk around in your home you're just letting it win. Being out in public felt so strange and uncomfortable because your illness doesn't like those environments. It would prefer you stay at home so it can slowly consume you without distraction. Do you enjoy alcohol? I'm obviously not going to recommend you drink your troubles away but it can be a very useful tool just to get yourself out there and socialize a little. If I lived by the ocean I would go out and enjoy it too. Also you know two languages which is kind of cool. Do you speak Spanish? I've been trying to learn Spanish for a long ass time \n",

I admit I never had the courage to walk up to a girl at the bar and start a chat, always felt like i'm really ugly, but as time passed I've started to build my confidence, and the fact that I had girls flirting with me also gave me a confidence boost aswell, as for today I have no problems whatsoever having a conversation with girls I know such as from my work, friends of friends, etc, I guess it only happens while i'm alone with her, outside of where we usually meet like work.. on the night before going to her I could barely get some sleep, I was nervous, but I thought its because of the long drive ahead of me, so the next day came, and I went out to her, when I met her I felt really weird, my brain started locking up again, and I was really embarrased from her parents and my stomache started acting up again so I had to go without anyone noticing, and I started feeling nausea again.. up and sit with 2 of his female friends at the bar, so I agreed and we went with our bikes to their house to pick them up, on our way there I just to stop like 5 times to pee, we picked them up and went to the bar, after sitting at the bar for like 10 minutes my brain just went into \"down\" mode, started feeling locked and then felt like im about to throw up, so I told them I'll be right back and went to the bathroom, and as far as I've gained distance from our table my nausea has reliefed and I didnt have to throw up and more so I decided to go back to the table, went there and sat for like 5 minutes, having good time, laughing, and then all of a sudden my brain does it again, and once again, out of the blue my stomache is going insane and I just had to literally run to the bathroom because I couldn't hold it for much long, it was really urgent.. on the first night we went out to the bar from some heavy drinking, and after I got drunk I've noticed im finally out of fight or flight state, feeling absolutley free and I've had the time of my life, laughing, dancing, just really enjoying everything, I thought its finally over but the next morning after the alcohol effect were gone I were back in that state.. and this point I realized something is off, and third time bad luck is too much, and I've started to realize that maybe its anxiety and my body is going into fight or flight state because its pretty much it's symptoms (nausea and having to go to the bathroom feeling).\n",

Just go to the most popular posts of this sub and you'll see that 99% of them are memes or text posts and some of them don't even have any core relation to social anxiety. Meanwhile, what does our [socially anxious friend with suicidal thoughts get?](Oh, 24 likes and 17 comments. Right. And you mean to tell me there's nothing wrong with this sub? Pathetic. I thought this place was meant to help people and discuss issues in our lives. If you just want to see the poor quality memes and text posts about your \"awkward\" social life why not surf tumblr instead of r/socialanxiety? Frankly, I don't have any idea why I'm still subscribed to this. I guess my naive mindset led me to believe that maybe this sub could eventually be actually helpful. \n",
