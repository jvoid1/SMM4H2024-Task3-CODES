And now that I'm here, realizing that in being soft spoken and quiet, and in turn something of a loner, I feel like I self sabotaged most of the relationships in my life that could have helped me through hard times, and that maybe I was the one perpetuating what I thought were toxic relationships by not being able to express myself well and making other people annoyed at me, to which I, in the end, just walk away because it's too much for me to deal with... most of the times I write for myself to deal with my emotions and this is the first time writing to where other people might see this, because I feel like I'm in need of other people to talk to about this stuff, and idk help to figure out how to make friends... I'm generally freaked out to post anything online, but I feel like I have to get this off my chest somewhere, and I spend too much time on Reddit so it seems like a good place...

As I look back on different situations in my life where I got anxious, nervous, and/or got this ‘numb-type feeling’ that overtook my body and my surroundings felt off, it was typically while skating, playing hockey, driving in a vehicle, being around a large crowd of people like in a sports arena, or anxiousness led to it and it took a little while to relax and for the sensation to go away.. I did get back into skating and hockey, and several years later, when I was probably around 16, I was in a hockey tournament and it happened once again but this time it was while playing on the rink.. This feeling I got while playing hockey or skating ultimately led me to quitting the sport I love.. Even though I loved skating and hockey more than anything, I basically had to be forced to go back and start skating again, as I was too afraid that it would happen again.. For all my life, I’ve felt wobbling and rocking sensations (like I’m on a boat) even while sitting still..

I had been looking through old photos and files and thought that I would share my personal experience of stepping way out of my comfort zone and overcoming a mountain of anxiety that I have experienced for most of my life.. To set some background, approximately 5 years ago I joined a local walking group within our village who meet up every Sunday to go for a long walk (with a nice pub stop at the end!).. I became good friends with one of the members of the group, Alan, who is a retired photographer and artist and as he is now in his mid 70's he enjoys keeping fit and socialising with the walking group.. Two years ago, during our pub stop after our walk on a Sunday, Alan was discussing that he had been planning on entering the art show that year but that a model that he had hired for his exhibition - *Sexuality in the Media vs Everyday Life* had cancelled at the last minute and that he was feeling quite down about this (art is a great escape and freedom for Alan after the death of his son a few years ago).\n",

I admit I never had the courage to walk up to a girl at the bar and start a chat, always felt like i'm really ugly, but as time passed I've started to build my confidence, and the fact that I had girls flirting with me also gave me a confidence boost aswell, as for today I have no problems whatsoever having a conversation with girls I know such as from my work, friends of friends, etc, I guess it only happens while i'm alone with her, outside of where we usually meet like work.. so I spent the entire weekend in fight or flight state, I barely ate anything the entire weekend, nausea and having to go the bathroom just came and went all the time, I went to the bathroom like 30 - 40 times during the past few days even if there was little to none to let out, but when that feeling came, I just had to run to the bathroom and felt nausea and my brain just locks up.\n",

And now that I'm here, realizing that in being soft spoken and quiet, and in turn something of a loner, I feel like I self sabotaged most of the relationships in my life that could have helped me through hard times, and that maybe I was the one perpetuating what I thought were toxic relationships by not being able to express myself well and making other people annoyed at me, to which I, in the end, just walk away because it's too much for me to deal with... most of the times I write for myself to deal with my emotions and this is the first time writing to where other people might see this, because I feel like I'm in need of other people to talk to about this stuff, and idk help to figure out how to make friends... I'm generally freaked out to post anything online, but I feel like I have to get this off my chest somewhere, and I spend too much time on Reddit so it seems like a good place... TL;DR I'm going crazy because I feel like social anxiety is ruining my life.. I felt relieved to move to a new city and get away from my college and I thought making new friends would be easier, since I like to do outdoor things like go on hikes, which is popular here, and I usually like to talk to people.. Several times I've tried to make new friends, usually because someone else introduced me, and I painfully initiated making plans, and maybe we've met up and done something outside once or a few times, but they eventually seem less interested in spending time together.\n",

So like every time I want to walk up to someone I get this weird feeling in my stomach or somewhere around there and it usually happens when I am anxious about something so that's how I know I have social anxiety and also because I ALWAYS seem to overthink about how to start a conversation before walking to someone and I just think I may annoy them or its not the right time or I don't have enough time to talk to them because in school breaks there is 5-10 minute breaks so I feel like we won't have enough time to introduce myself and it would be akward I also feel like that when I leave the school and want to talk to someone as if its not the right time and place to talk to someone.. My lack of friends is really putting me down and the only solution I know is to stay home and never go outside to look at people my age.. How can I walk up to someone in my school and start a conversation with them/maybe befriend them... I even feel anxious when I am just walking around and thinking that people are laughing at me when I can't know if they laughed at me or something else..

As I look back on different situations in my life where I got anxious, nervous, and/or got this ‘numb-type feeling’ that overtook my body and my surroundings felt off, it was typically while skating, playing hockey, driving in a vehicle, being around a large crowd of people like in a sports arena, or anxiousness led to it and it took a little while to relax and for the sensation to go away.. I did get back into skating and hockey, and several years later, when I was probably around 16, I was in a hockey tournament and it happened once again but this time it was while playing on the rink.. This feeling I got while playing hockey or skating ultimately led me to quitting the sport I love.. Even though I loved skating and hockey more than anything, I basically had to be forced to go back and start skating again, as I was too afraid that it would happen again.. For all my life, I’ve felt wobbling and rocking sensations (like I’m on a boat) even while sitting still.. Later on into childhood, I was doing a lot of skating at hockey rinks and playing hockey.\n",

Two years ago, during our pub stop after our walk on a Sunday, Alan was discussing that he had been planning on entering the art show that year but that a model that he had hired for his exhibition - *Sexuality in the Media vs Everyday Life* had cancelled at the last minute and that he was feeling quite down about this (art is a great escape and freedom for Alan after the death of his son a few years ago).\n",

In junior high I was the best player on my schools basketball team, and I played basketball for my high school in 9th and 10th grade..
