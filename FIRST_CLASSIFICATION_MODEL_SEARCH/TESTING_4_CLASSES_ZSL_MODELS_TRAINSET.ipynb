Defeated I tried to think of ways to salvage this. Then I thought of an idea.

I said thank you and gave her an answer to a question she didn\\'t know and that was it. I had successfully completed the task I had longed to do for weeks now. After the class was over we went to the front of the class to hand in that assignment and she asked me for the pencil I was holding to write her name on her paper.

I did so, I went in the lobby and say through the window into the room where all the kids were, the boy and his friends were putting up gang signs and pretending that they were beating me up, some other kids were looking at me and laughing. Long story short, the tutor goes in the room, comes out snickering, one of the boys comes out tells me that they weren't talking about me they were talking about a cartoon, I don't believe him, tell my mom, we talk to the principal, she tells me I might have anger issues, doesn't do anything, and every time I go to school I walk into the lobby with the front desk people looking at me weird, and the kids who know and saw what happen still laughing at me, only this time it's to my face.

I\\'ve missed countless opportunities, can\\'t hold down a job, and can\\'t keep a relationship all due to my anxiety. And it\\'s really starting to take a toll on me. I haven\\'t had a real job since 2012, and even that was only a summer job. I can barely even go into a store and buy myself something, so I really can\\'t imagine being on the other side of the counter. I\\'m from a small town where the only jobs available are in fast food and grocery stores. I\\'ve been looking for work-from-home type jobs/extra sources of income online almost every day for years and placed my resumes around online but I\\'ve either gotten rejected due to my resume not being built up enough, or not gotten a reply at all. I\\'ve even considered some \"work\" that would tear away any bit of self respect I had, just to get by. My mother does everything for me. She makes almost all of my phone calls, checks items in for me at the store, etc. It\\'s not like I haven\\'t tried to be independent. I\\'ve tried to do these things by myself. For example, making appointments. I remember making my own appointments a few times (and I can feel my heart racing just thinking about it). The entire time (as the phone rang, during the call, and immediately after) I wanted to curl up in a ball and die. It doesn\\'t go away or slowly get better, no matter how many times I do it. It just keeps getting worse. I\\'ve been told countless times by family, friends, strangers, counsellors and therapists to just face my fears head on and eventually they\\'ll become easier to deal with. That may be true but I can\\'t continue putting myself in situations that just about kill me in hopes that my anxiety will ease up someday. It hasn\\'t yet in 4 years, in fact it\\'s probably gotten worse. My mother and step-father have been nothing but helpful to me. They\\'ve supported me immensely through all of this, even though they\\'ve gotten frustrated and don\\'t really understand the concept of anxiety. They\\'ve been feeding me, clothing me and giving me shelter my entire life at no cost at all, but I can tell they\\'re getting tired of me doing nothing with my life. They (along with everyone else in my life) are continuously nagging at me with judgemental questions like \"Why don\\'t you just go back to school?\" \"Why don\\'t you just put a resume in at McDonald\\'s?\" \"Why are you not out on your own yet?\" It\\'s hard living like this. Everyone thinks I\\'m just a lazy spoiled piece of shit living off my parents. The last part is true but it\\'s not like I WANT this. I would love to take my dog and move out. I wouldn\\'t care if it was to some run down shack. I would love to have a job. I wouldn\\'t care about hours or labor or being able to afford anything extra, as long as I made enough to survive on my own. All I want is to be comfortable. To not have anxiety attacks every where I go, with every move I make. This has been hard on my love life too. I mean, love is the least of my concerns right now. But my anxiety (and depression at the time) has killed, or at least helped kill, every relationship I\\'ve been in. Men don\\'t want women who have nothing going for them. Even so, I tried my hardest to make it work. I had a life planned out with someone I loved very much. I wanted to get married and start a family with this person, but I couldn\\'t get past my anxiety to put those goals in motion, and neither could he. He eventually moved on to someone more mentally stable who had the ability to make money to help him pay bills. It\\'s all about compromise, I understand that. I didn\\'t expect him to stick around.

I know I can\\'t live with my parents forever, I know I\\'m going to have to do something eventually. The idea just terrifies me because my options are so limited and I have no clue what I\\'m going to become. An even bigger nervous wreck? Absolutely nothing? I don\\'t need to be rich. I don\\'t need a significant other. I just need to live somewhat comfortably. And it seems impossible to get there.

I was incredibly alone, my roommates and I just hadn't jelled. I was really depressed and suicidal. I'd spend weekends in my room crying. It was one of the worst times of my life. But I had one great night. It was February. One of my roommates brought up his girlfriend for the weekend. He went to take a shower at one point and me and her were alone with each other. I'm really bad at small talk but for whatever reason I just felt comfortable around her. She was beautiful but also approachable. She had this ora to her. For about 20 minutes, we talked. She told me that she also has socially anxiety. It was the best conversation I've ever had with a woman. Actually, it was one of the best conversations I've ever had with anybody. It was only about 20 minutes but it felt like a lot longer, I wish it would've been longer. Eventually I had to come back down to reality and realize it was just a conversation. She was taken and that sucked. Months went by. I had a great summer and I got a lot better physically and psychologically. I wasn't suicidal anymore. The next year was going by pretty well. Then on one October night I was talking to a friend before my college's football game and I heard a voice say my name. It was her. She saw me. I think it was the first time in my life The girl as pretty as her went out of her way to approach me. Once again we talked. I still remember how she looked. She had her hair curled and she was wearing a college stocking cap that accentuated her amazing green eyes. I took in every word that she said through that adorable lisp of hers. She even said that her and her boyfriend broke up. I messaged her Twitter a few weeks after that asking for her number, she never responded. I thought that was it, time to move on. I guess I misjudged it, I guess she didn't want me. I guess I just wasn't good enough for her. And that's not her fault, it's always mine. I have nothing to offer. I had to just try and move on. A few months passed since then. I thought about her every so often, but I didn't see her ever so it wasn't like I had very many reminders. Then a few weeks ago I just started thinking of her. I messaged her on Twitter and told her about the conversation we had last year and about how much it meant to me and how I wanted to thank her for that. She responded this time. She was so nice and I could just tell it meant a lot to her to hear that. I thought that would be the end of it. Last week I saw her on Saturday morning. She was eating breakfast in our cafeteria because the one in her dorm is closed on Saturday mornings. I approached her. I even asked to sit down. I never have the confidence to do things like that. I never have the confidence to even approach a woman but it was like second nature when I saw her. We talked and I got the same feelings I did that I had when I talked to her for the very first time. I was comfortable. As awesome as it was it was a little bit upsetting because this is the end of the year and I wasn't gonna have much of a chance to see her over the summer, but I added her on Facebook and thought that maybe I'd try to make a run at her.

Now I know that not everyone's version of SA is the same and we've all obviously had different life experiences..but is there some common theme in our upbringing's that have led to these patterns of thought? For me, I think I've pinpointed a few things that have been major contributors: [This is a post in and of itself so I'll try and condense it] My dad was/is an extremely angry person. Not all the time, but I was scared shitless of him when I was a kid. At times, the level of ferocity I saw out of him towards either myself or (mostly) my oldest brother or mom, could be described as barbaric. I think a lot of my reserved nature comes from the fact that I would sometimes not say what I was thinking or ask a question in fear of what he might do or how he would react. A lot of times he wouldn't necessarily get super angry if I asked a question, but would respond in a frustrated and annoyed/bothered way that would prevent me from wanting to ask questions in the future. When I was transitioning from 4th to 5th grade, my parents switched me from a private to public school (another post in and of itself) because they could no longer afford the tuition fees. When I made the switch, although I was a relatively popular kid, I was bullied by a group of kids who I was also kind of friends with at the time. When I say bullied it was more along the lines of being made fun of, no physical attacks or anything. They liked me but were also relentless in finding things they could pick on me for. I think this group of kids did a huge amount of damage in terms of me wanting, or feeling like I NEED to be accepted. The other one would be my mom's incessant expectations from my family (when my parents were still together) to act as if we were one big happy Christian family unit. When in reality, we were the farthest thing from it. It was complete dysfunction. It was angry and turbulent. I, being the youngest of three brothers, had no idea why the fuck things were the way they were. My mom would always want us to put on a smile and made sure we could be looked at as shining examples of well-behaved Pleasanton kids to our fellow church goers and her much more successful, put together and ultra religous older sister. Again, I think this engrained the need to feel accepted in to me. I am fairly positive there is more to SA than just traumatic or troubling life experiences, but I most definitely think they can play an enormous role in leading to, or contributing to the thoughts we all can't seem to escape. Sorry for the lengthy ass post, but I'm tired of living the way that I do.

I stopped in at my neighborhood supermarket to pick up a few groceries and some beer. Like many of you, I dread the process of going through the checkout line, for many reasons. There\\'s the expectation of small talk with cashiers, the possibility that something might go wrong with their computer systems and you won\\'t be able to pay or might somehow end up holding up the line, the fear that people in line behind you are judging you based on what you\\'re buying, and about ~10 more subanxieties like that. I\\'m almost 22 but I look more like I\\'m 17. I have an out of state drivers license that I haven\\'t updated/renewed yet so it still has my original picture of 16 year-old me, the worst picture of me in existence because it looks more like a mugshot, back when I had really really long hair because I was an angsty teenager. Basically, it\\'s a terrible picture and it looks nothing like me, so naturally I dread having to show my ID whenever I buy alcohol (which I buy so I can get drunk alone so I can stop worrying about everything for a few hours), and I have to show my ID every time I buy alcohol because I look young. Cashiers usually do a double take, and I worry that they\\'re going to laugh at my picture or something, and then they make some comment about how I cut my hair or how I have an out of state license, and I try to joke like \"I was 16 when that picture was taken haha\" or \"yeah I really need to get that updated,\" et cetera. And because it\\'s a terrible picture of me I dread having girls see it, so I try to avoid checkout lanes with female cashiers, which sometimes means having to wait in a longer line, which I don\\'t want to do because then people will judge me and wonder why I\\'m choosing to go through a longer line when there are other open checkout lanes, and then some cute cashier in checkout lane #3 will wave and yell \"I can help you over here sir!\" so a lot of times I end up walking around the store, pretending I forgot something, pretending to look for it, until there\\'s a short checkout line with a non-attractive-female-cashier checkout lane open. Which is exactly what happened today. So at first it happens like any other time, and I have my ID ready to show when the guy asks for it, having mentally prepared/rehearsed this whole ordeal before I even stepped into the store. But this time he doesn\\'t ask to see it, which completely throws off my whole mental plan, like a train being derailed, and now I\\'m lost. Then I look up and this girl bagging my groceries is staring at me and I don\\'t know what to do, and she tells me I \"look like that guy from the Lord of the Rings.\" In an effort to be social and easygoing, I pretend to laugh and ask which character. She says \"the main guy.\" \"Frodo?\" I ask. She says yes, that\\'s the guy, and in my head I\\'m trying to process how strange and unexpected this conversation is, and how to proceed. So with 90% of my mental energy focused on continuing, and ending, this social situation, only 10% of my brain is focused on getting my groceries, and I fail to notice that she didn\\'t put the six pack of beer in the one reusable bag I brought, but left it on the counter, because apparently baggers don\\'t put that kind of thing in bags for some reason. So I manage to exit the conversation and get the hell out of there and go to my car. A few minutes later I pull into my driveway, open the trunk of my car, and see a lack of beer in the grocery bag. I check the receipt and there\\'s a $10.99 charge for it, but it\\'s not here. I quickly realize what happened. Now I\\'m afraid to go back. I don\\'t want to endure the awkward ordeal of returning to the store and interacting with that same cashier and bagger (it\\'s a smaller store with not a lot of people working there) and explaining that I left my beer there. What if the weird Frodo resemblance conversation picks back up again? What if someone else is there and I have to show my ID and receipt to prove that I purchased it? What if other people in the store are watching? The SA TL;DR of it is I\\'m too afraid to get my $10.99 worth of alcohol, which I rightfully purchased. What\\'s more, because there are so few people working there, there\\'s a good chance that I\\'ll run into those two employees again, and I know the bagger girl at least will remember me, and then she might remember that I left some beer there once and never went back to get it, and could get really awkward, so basically I can never go back to that store again because I might run into them. I bought alcohol to treat my SA, but my SA is preventing me from having it, in the same way that I want to see a therapist but I\\'m too nervous to do so or to even make an appointment via phone call in the first place. I\\'m basically fucked either way because I can\\'t bring myself to do anything. This is such bullshit. My brain is a fucking idiot. I know it\\'s true. Sometimes I\\'ll subtly cry for help by bringing up my SA with coworkers, and they casually say some shit like \"you just gotta get over it man\" or \"you just need to do it.\" NO FUCKING SHIT. It\\'s sooooo easy for you, but I can\\'t. Don\\'t tell me to \"just say hi to someone\" because I\\'ve been at war with SA and depression everyday for the past 12 years and I\\'m still losing. I\\'ve tried changing my mindset hundreds of times. I\\'ve tried meds. Don\\'t fucking tell me to just get over it and make it seem like I\\'m just a shy person who\\'s hesitant to step outside their comfort zone. Something is biologically wrong with me, because people aren\\'t supposed to think and feel this way. Something as simple as forgetting something at the store should not cause this much distress and the urge to write a long Reddit post rant. I really don\\'t understand how my head works, but I know it\\'s severely messed up for whatever reason, and I have no choice in that. Or maybe I do. Maybe they\\'re right, and I\\'m just a coward who\\'s too scared and weak to step outside his comfort zone, who uses social anxiety as an excuse. But I really don\\'t think so. I really don\\'t think shyness is supposed to make you sweat and make your heart race and make your stomach hurt and make you tremble and feel physically ill. This is not how life is supposed to work. And I just wanted some beer, that\\'s all. I just wanted to get a little intoxicated so I could calm down for once, is that too much to ask?

I\\'m 20 years old and I should have graduate last year. It\\'s a little complicated to explain so,during my first year of high school I had cancer. Yay. I failed that year because I couldn\\'t go to school and yeah,it was horrible. But then I got better and at the same time really worse. I was diagnosed with depression and i kinda still fight it. But no cancer so I started school again. Fifteen years old in a class of fourteen years old. But it was okay for four years. I always had social anxiety,since I was 6 i think (my mom told me that). I always was afraid to talk with other people,always hated to go out even just to see the sky. And growing up things got so much worse. I usually used to spend all of my summer at home,without ever going out (when i was 17 I stayed in my house for 37 days without ever going out). Thing is,I hate it. I hate to not have a life and I hate to have one. Whenever I go out I just can\\'t breathe. It\\'s hard to explain,really hard because i know it seems stupid. But I feel like I can\\'t breathe and the simple idea of talking with other people makes my heart race so much I feel like dying.And I could go on with talking about how I feel for hours but I guess you kinda know how social anxiety feels,right? Also yeah, I went for a few years to a therapist. And then to another. Pills don\\'t help at all. I just get sleepy and never leave the house because of that.

Not good but i wasn\\'t slowly killing myself anymore. So I started again high school. I just had to do one last year. I felt good with myself. But,spoiler alert, everything got bad again. I tried to suck it up,still going to school even when I didn\\'t feel well,managing my panic attacks with going to the restroom and saying I had a digestion problem. And if I couldn\\'t go there I just tried to think about anything else and pretend I was okay. And that kinda ruined me.

            "{'sequence': \"('Friendship Help. Hello, for a little bit of background I'm [15/M] a sophomore in high school with depression and anxiety. These people I'm about to talk about have been close friends with me for about a year. TL;DR AT END. Everything was going very well in the relationship with this group of friends. Throughout the summer [currently late fall] we would hang out often and would send each other snapchats frequently. Everything was fine until a week or so before school started. I found out the six of them had a group chat without me and were face timing each other but not me. Naturally, I felt hurt, but I didn't address it just then. Then a couple days before the start of school, I FaceTime one of them telling them how I feel alone and depressed. They can't really handle this talk and aren't too comforting. Jump forward about a month I find out they hang out almost weekly without me. I try to schedule activities with them, yet they're always busy together. At this point they are avidly talking in the group chat, yet almost never texting, snapchatting or face timing me. Whenever I'm with them in school they text in their chat. I confront one of them, we'll call them Clara, and ask why they've been doing stuff without me and why they have a group chat without me. Their only response is that they haven't been doing much without me and that almost no one uses the group chat anymore. Both are blatant lies. Forward another few weeks and they've been closer with each other more and more. Additionally they are adding others to the friend group that I'm not particularly fond of or close with. Seeing this, I ask Clara if they want to hang out because I don't want our friendship to slip away. She says sure and we end up hanging out. However, I was uncomfortable and unable to talk the entire time because they were all infatuated with the new additions to the friend group, who, unknowingly to me, were invited. This resulted in a very awkward hang out for me while they were all able to enjoy themselves. As each week passes our school hosts another football game. I ask each one of them if they want to hang out after and they are all busy. Despite this, I hang out with them at the game and end up overhearing them making plans for after the game. In addition, several games I asked if they were going to the game and they said no. Yet, I find out through other people or social media that they went together. This type of thing happens often in the following weeks. They have group hangs without me and do activities without me such as hiking or doing a 5k. One day in school I mention to one of them in an offhand way that they shouldn't wear a specific shirt because it was somewhat revealing. This was stupid of me. I am told the next period by another member that my comment was hurtful to the directed member of the group. I immediately text her, saying I'm sorry. She says it's fine, yet I still, even now, feel terrible. As a result of this I start avoiding them a little bit to reduce the awkwardness and to let things cool down. A few times I try sliding back in, but they all leave and talk amongst themselves. I ask Clara why they distanced from me. She said no one is distancing from me. Most recently, I asked Clara if she wanted to do anything for Black Friday. Clara told me that she was shopping, to which I said that I wanted to go. I took this as a sign she was busy and didn't want to do anything with me. Then I contact another friend, we'll call her Lois, and ask if she is going shopping with Clara; she says she is. I try invoking that I wanted an invitation by saying I want to go, but she doesn't pick up. Just yesterday I was talking with one of the newest members of their friend group [whom I've been acquainted with for some time] on PS4, his name will be Rob. Unknowingly, he left his microphone on when he got a FaceTime from Lois. Lois was hanging with Clara and her brother and wanted to see if Rob wanted to join them. As Rob was a new member to the friend group, I naturally felt jealous and hurt that Lois face timed him and that he was invited while I, a long time friend, wasn't. Their conversation continued on about the next day [Black Friday]. They talked about how they felt bad that no one wanted to do anything with me. Rob mentioned how he would've invited himself to go shopping as opposed to what I did, which was attempting to get an invite. Then Lois invited Rob to go with them for Black Friday. At this point I felt incredibly hurt and, while still listening on PS4, texted Clara. I asked her, rather confrontationally, why they didn't want to do shit with me and why they don't like me anymore. To this she said she had no idea what I was talking about. I told her I heard Rob and Lois on the FaceTime. I brought up the other instances too, about how they hang together, how they tell each other things they won't tell me and so on. I tell her it makes me feel terrible and depressed. Yet again, they cannot handle the talk about depression and tell me that they get uncomfortable with me when I bring it up. I asked again if they want be friends at all to which they said yes, and that they cared for me deeply. They said they didn't want the friendship to come to this point of discomfort just as I didn't. They said I've been too interrogating and clingy, which I see completely. All the times I've asked about what they are doing and why they don't do it with me is clearly pushy. But if I don't ask, I'm not told. At this point in the texting Rob has been told by Clara and Lois that I've found out, so he leaves me on PS4. Clara says that things would've been better had I not been so clingy and questioning. To this I reply that I'll let them do their stuff and that I'm sorry. We say goodnight and leave each other alone. Note: Other friend groups aren't an option for various reasons. TL;DR: A friendship group of about a year has been adding new members that they are close with while distancing themselves from me. I ask them why, but they see it as interrogative and clingy. I don't know how to maintain a relationship with people when attempts to do things together are seen as clingy and asking about what's happening in the friend group is confrontational. I don't have other options for friends and I need to repair this relationship.

When I hear about other people with social anxiety, it's usually tied to their self-esteem or ego/sense of self-worth. For example, perhaps someone feels self-conscious about the way they look. They avoid people and feel anxious in public because they don't want to be judged. Or maybe they have some embarrassing trait/interest/quirk/whatever and they're afraid that people will laugh at them for it, so they become anxious when placed in the spotlight. The thing is, I don't feel inferior to people at all (nor do I feel superior) I'm actually quite content and confident with who I am. In fact, I'm even less affected by judgement than most people. I've given speeches to large audiences etc and spoke to complete strangers when the situation demanded it. I'm not ashamed of myself, or feel that I am lesser to others like some other SA sufferers. However, I still experience the biological effects of anxiety. When interacting with friends for an 'prolonged' period (which is about 1 hour for me), my mind just stops working, I have to focus really hard to come up with responses, my mind just blanks out and I feel on edge, in permanent 'flight or fight' mode. It's like I lose 100 IQ points by just being in the vicinity of people. I don't even have to talk to them, just being in a quiet library surrounded by people is a lot more physically uncomfortable than me sitting at home alone. For that reason, I dislike going out, hated school when I was growing up etc. It doesn't feel good physically, so I avoid situations not because I fear people's judgement etc., but because I just don't want to experience the physical discomfort that comes with anxiety caused by socializing. The way I explain to people is this, imagine a haunted house at a theme park. You know that the ghosts are just actors, but your body responds as if they are real threats, and when the scare actor pops up behind you, you scream because your lizard brain interprets the event as a threat even though you are perfectly capable of rationalizing and recognizing that it is not a threat. Similarly, I don't feel self-conscious about the way I come across to people, my looks/personality/intellect etc., but my lizard brain keeps interpreting people as threats and I don't think I just can't biologically help it. No sure if its related, but I don't find rollercoasters fun at all. I'm not afraid of them, and if my friends want to go on them together I will, the physical sensation of being on a roller coaster (or any physically intensive activity, for that matter) just doesn't translate to enjoyment in my brain. Just pulling things out of my ass now, but it's like my brain doesn't find adrenaline /thrill-seeking fun, because it probably 'used up' all that adrenaline for my anxiety. Can anyone relate to this? Any way to alleviate anxiety naturally? I've tried exercise, diet etc, which helped, but only to a certain extent. **TLDR; I have no self-esteem/confidence problems.

            "{'sequence': \"('How can I feel like this all the time?. Hey everyone. I'm sorry if this gets kind of long, but I just needed to get it off my chest and maybe ask for some of your thoughts. TL;DR at the bottom if you don't care to read, but I'd be grateful if you would. I've dealt with social anxiety since I was in 1st grade (first time I noticed it affecting me at least). Of course, I didn't know that's what it was at the time, and I just felt really sick all of the time. Tried counseling and such, but I think I was just too young at that point. I'm 19 now and I haven't let this stupid thing beat me down yet. It's hell for sure, but it WILL NOT get the best of me. Anyway, something that I have noticed recently is that I can sometimes get myself into this extremely confident state where I could not care less about what people think of me and I am super outgoing, but it is rare. It doesn't last long, and soon I'm back to trying not to puke in anticipation of the next social encounter I have to face. I have an example, but it needs a little setup: I work at a fast food restaurant where most of my coworkers are girls. And that's awesome! And terrifying! For the first several months, I hardly spoke to anyone. One of my managers even thought that I hated her because I never even tried to make small talk with her. Fortunately, my cousin works at the same place and let her know that it's just the way I am until you get to know me. Thanks for looking out man. Eventually I came out of my shell a little bit, and I became pretty good friends with 2 of my managers. They were the only ones that I felt really comfortable talking with and I looked forward to working with them whenever possible. Recently, that got really complicated. Manager #1 (the one who thought I hated her but doesn't anymore) tells me that both Managers #2 and #3 (my good friends) have crushes on me despite the fact that they already have boyfriends. Confuses and scares the hell out of me even though I am pretty happy about it (I liked them from the beginning). There are some major problems now and my anxiety about it is through the roof. (1) I have exactly 0 experience with girls and I don't want to screw this up (2) They both have longtime boyfriends and I'm not getting in the middle of that at this point (3) Even though Manager #1 (a good friend of the other two) tells me this news straight up, I cannot bring myself to believe it because my self-esteem is kind of shot. Anyway, now working with either one or both of them is something I both look forward to and dread because just thinking about it makes me sick (screw you brain). I'll be honest, I'm kind of obsessed thinking about both of them now (not in a creepy way at all, just in the classic anxiously replaying past interactions in my head sort of way) So finally, we get to that example I mentioned. Last week, I had a shift with one of my friend/crush/managers and I was absolutely sick to my stomach the whole night. Felt like complete shit and barely made it through the shift without emptying my guts all over the store. The next day, I work again, only this time, it's not with either of these two girls. Somehow on the way to work I got into this mindset that I was the most confident person on the planet, and as soon as I walked in the door, everybody greeted me like we were best friends. This never happens. These people rarely speak to me and now over the entire shift they are chatting it up with me. And the best part is, I felt completely comfortable with it. Having conversations about everything under the sun and loving it. No feeling sick to my stomach, no panic. I felt like I was thriving, and I felt normal for once. I want that again. I want it bad, and I want it all the time. One more thing worth mentioning that is not related to work but still important is that I lifted weights for the first time in a long time a few days ago. I basically pushed myself to the limit, and afterwards, I had that feeling again. I'm assuming that's the endorphins kicking ass, but I don't know for sure. Endorphins wouldn't really explain the mindset I had going into work, would they? Anyway, I've gone on for WAY too long as it is, but there is so much more that I feel like I want to say. I'm really glad that I found this sub because it feels awesome to have support from people who know what I am going through. If anybody has any ideas about how to get into this state of mind again, I would be incredibly happy to hear about it. Stay strong everyone! Thanks! TL;DR - On rare occasion, I can get myself into an insanely confident state of mind that basically eliminates my anxiety.

Body-dysmorphia is often found alongside SA in a lot of cases, based on very founded tendencies for people to assume badly of others based purely on their appearance. Many bad perceptions are due to factors that can be hard to change. And let's be clear it's not as simple as lifting your problems away.

I've always felt as If I had social anxiety ever since middle school. I believe it was due to the fact that all I could ever think about was World of Warcraft and literally NOTHING else mattered to me besides online video games. That followed into my freshmen year but then I started cross country. Then during my sophomore year, I started to grow into myself and reach puberty...getting a wonderful girlfriend at the age of 16. For 6 years, we were dating on and off(breaking up twice) and I feel as if in those 6 years, I really started to feel like I've discovered who I truly was. But then in 2015 I started Paramedic school and was told by a classmate that If I start taking adderall that I will study for 8 hours without taking a break and never feel tired. That got me really excited, especially trying it later that week and instantly got hooked. A year goes by, and my addiction for adderall took back all of that progress that I had on discovering myself. I felt as if I was a robot. Whenever I was coming down or wasn't on adderall...I didn't have any emotions. I felt sad but couldn't cry. I never felt happy. There would be moment where I was know something is really funny but I couldn't laugh. This, with other factors, ruined my relationship with my 6 year long girlfriend. After this, I stopped taking adderall. For about 4 months, I had major anxiety...especially social anxiety. But when I got a job as a paramedic, that all goes away because of the situations you're put in 4 days a week for 12 hours straight. After working as a paramedic for about 9 months, I had my worse call I've ever had. We were the first ones on scene for a 2 month old who is in cardiac arrest. We worked the child for 40 minutes...It really got to me. For about 2 months after that, I would start crying randomly thinking about the child. As well as being upset about this, I gained my anxiety back. I would come to a point where I would wake up in my apartment deathly afraid to even go outside to go talk to my twin brother. Even making eye contact made me so scared. After awhile, It got a little better...but at the time I always had that anxiety in the back of my mind, constantly thinking about stupid stuff with social interactions. But then one week I had a week off of work and I decided to take acid with my close friends. (yes I know taking drugs especially when you're a healthcare provider is frown upon but who cares.) I felt great for 4 hour but then I suddenly couldn't stop thinking about how I could think of something to say to my friends but would be too scared if it wasn't that great...or making eye contact...Am I staring at them for too long? Am I creepy?? What the FUCK is wrong with me??! I went into a negative spiral. My friends tried to help but there was no distracting me. I've had this happen before when I am sober but nothing like this. Suddenly after 30 minutes of completely fighting my negative thoughts, telling myself that having this thoughts was not normal and I need to stop immediately, I just accepted it fully. I told myself that it's okay to be having these thoughts. When I accepted it, I didn't have that major anxiety before. My anxiety was causing this like heavy blanket placed onto me and I felt as if I was being smoldered or being drowned. I literally just said it is okay to be in my thoughts and to be alone and to stop thinking about what the others might be thinking.

I want to stop thinking about her.. 2 Weeks ago, I sent a message to a girl on an online dating site, she responded and we kept the conversation going for about an hour. We have a 99% match on the site, We had LOTS in common. I had to log out since i had something to finish up for school so i told her i really enjoy talking to her and asked for other methods of contact off the site and she gave me her number. A couple days later and she responds to another message i sent and we messaged each other for about an hour, discovering more in common. I had to go to school so i told her i\\'d speak to her later or she can message me later, this is where conversations really started slowing down. Even though i had her number, I was SUPER NERVOUS to text her. That weekend I finally texted her though she said she was super busy working on a project and i asked her about the project, she told me, I said it was really interesting and told her that i\\'ll let her get back to work and she can contact me later. Then i said good luck and she said \"thanks ;)\" A few days later i texted her but she told me she was in school at the moment so i said she can contact me whenever she is not busy. She said ok and hopes i have a good day :) in which i replied for her to have one too. On sunday i messaged her saying hi happy easter and she replied back with happy easter ;). A few hours later I asked how her weekend was but no response, i wonder if the message even went through or she just didnt want to message me. I was told I should ask her out but i dont want to take things so quick or fear she wouldnt want to. I also dont want to come off as annoying by messaging her all the time. She most likely might not be interested but she did tell me she was shy  and introverted, much like myself except i classify myself as being worse, she could be nervous. I am a 20 year old guy who never had a gf before or experience except for one in my freshman year of college that i ended up finding out through google that she was 32, I asked her out but she said maybe and we never went out, I always been way too shy (voted as most shy guy in my HS yearbook) The big problem is that I can\\'t stop thinking about her one bit throughout the day, I always have this headache like feeling in the top center of my head where it feels like a dent in my skull, not much pain but this sharp tingling feeling. I can\\'t really concentrate on anything else, I just have thoughts about being with her, hanging out, eating at a restaurant, taking long walks together holding hands, hugging, at the theater, sitting inside together relaxing, or that she is just with me wherever I am. I\\'m not really ready to jump into sex so thats not what I care for in a girl. We never met but I cant help but keep looking at her online profile which she never really logs on and look at her pictures and our conversations.

I sent her a friend request, but I assume my friend did too, because he told me she started messaging him. instead of me. Just yesterday she starts messaging me. My friend she was messaging decided not to really pursue her, which meant that I was next in line, I guess. Anyways, after messaging back and forth for a while I decide to push past the anxiety and offer to smoke with her.

I always think that my roommates and other people talk about me and how 'weird' I probably seem to them because a lot of the time I just can't bring myself to contribute to conversations, and I can sit there mute for a long time.

I have family members with anxiety, but not social anxiety... and I just found out that my biological grandfather (who I've never met) has been painfully shy his entire life and is now an alcoholic.

I've been feeling sad and tired a lot lately as well, I think because of how much my anxiety is affecting and bothering me.

I find that once people get to know me as the 'quiet, shy girl', I can't get out of that stereotype because that's how they see me, and if I changed (if I knew how), even more attention would be placed on me because I'd be so different.

And logically i know that its not right to think this way but i can’t control it. I feel like i started to get better too late and that I’m so much behind everyone else, its hard to think that i’ll ever catch up. I’m fucking 20 years old, and never had a girlfriend and only have a few friends. All of my other friends have moved on and I don’t see them anymore, and its my fault.

I feel good about other aspects of my life, i think i have a very healthy view on the world and on life, I’m smart, I’m a good person, i even feel bad about writing these things here where nobody is ever going to see them. I am too critical of myself and nothing is ever good enough. I have too much and yet its nowhere near enough. My anxiety is like a constant shadow following me everywhere, and i can’t seem to escape no matter what i do. And its so hard to fight fear when the only cure is to experience more of it. That first step is like those dreams when you run with all your strength but you don’t move even a tiny bit, or fighting a monster and your punches and kicks feel like you are in a pool of maple syrup. And the only way forward is in your hands, you have to make that move, sitting around and waiting for it to pass is the worst thing you can do. The fact that your willpower is the only way forward makes it so much harder. There is no magic cure, no book that you could read or movie you can watch, its all just your responsibility. You have to find the strength to move forward. Its worse than any other simple fear because its your whole life. Its like if you were a spider farmer with arachnophobia, or a skydiver with a fear of heights. It follows you everywhere, its the only thing you think about. Its stop you from enjoying everything life has to offer. Whenever I feel good about anything in my life, the shadow immediately appears over my thoughts, you can’t feel anything good without thinking about anxiety right after. It undercuts joy of any kind. And there are so many other problems that people have that are much worse, but I can’t think about their problems when this is everything to me. My worst fear is dying before I can get over it. I don’t want it to be my whole life. When I think about death its not itself that is bothering me its that I didn’t do anything with my life, that I never had love, never had a relationship, never had sex. The only time i kissed anyone i was blackout drunk. I don’t even remember what it really feels like. I missed out on so much because of this. And whenever I’m alone and thinking straight, I see how stupid and pointless this fear is, but when I’m out there it completely takes me over, I don’t think straight, I don’t think at all, the fear becomes everything, its like a demon possessing my whole body, mind and soul. I don’t do what i want, what I’m supposed to. Its hard to do the right thing in the moment when your own thoughts betray you. I realize what i should have said or done, only when its over. And beat myself up for it, but its no use. Its not really me thats doing it. Its like a completely different person. Its a poisonous cloud that covers your mind, its shackles you to the ground. If i had time and the ability to chose what i would say or do, i believe i would almost always chose the right thing. If i had a popup bubble of conversation options like in a video game, i would choose the right one most of the time, even despite the fear, but my mind won’t let me. I think in a healthy way only when I’m alone. But there must be a way forward, there always is, its just hard to find it with all this darkness around. But i will. I have to. I’m a man and its my responsibility to get better. Not just to myself but to my family and friends, to the whole world. I have to go into battle, because death in that battle is far better then a life of cowardice and fear. As the Spartan wives used to say “Either return with your shield or on it”, or as the Vikings believed Valhalla awaits only the brave.

Social Anxiety where do I begin? I feel as if I know it that well I could write a series of novels on it, you know where Im coming from? I\\'ll start from the beginning. As far back as I can remember I was a normal kid I was very outgoing loved being the centre of attention and the class clown throughout school, I was always their to make teachers and other students laugh whether it was by telling jokes or generally making a fucking idiot of myself........what I\\'m trying to get at is I was once upon a time a social kid. When I left school I pursued a career in the Construction industry bagging myself a Plumbing apprenticeship and also working in a bar as a barman serving and interacting with customers, a job I loved and the fact I would meet all walks of life every weekend and hear the story\\'s they would have to tell my 16 year old self. At this point in my life everything was running smoothly and I can hold my hand up high and say I was fucking loving life and what it had to offer and I was looking forward to the future ahead. Fast forward a couple of years to April 2012 just after my 18th birthday, I started dabbling in drugs with my friends now I wasn\\'t hanging around with the wrong crowd id had the same set of mates since I was at high school and they were good nice lads, we just got into the wrong things. Now I\\'d smoke the odd joint when I was a teenager but did nothing out the ordinary until a new legal high came around called \"Mkat\". \"Mkat\" fuck me if I could tell my 18 year old self anything it would be to not touch this drug ever. Anyway everyone was doing it, it was the new thing to do and everything was fine when I first started taking it and then after a while I would get paranoid and think people were speaking about me, or looking at me funny, then I\\'d go home sleep it off and I would be sound the next day other than having a shitty comedown. But this one time this all happened I went home tried to sleep it off but it was as if something had clicked in my head. I started getting nervous and anxious being around people I couldn\\'t make eye contact with people anymore and couldn\\'t hold a conversation with people for more than 30 seconds, I fucking started to hate small talk and would avoid all social events, I didn\\'t know what the fuck was wrong with me. I googled my symptoms and it came up that I had social anxiety, I though you fucker this is from that night you took Mkat and hit paranoi you\\'ve haven\\'t clicked out of that anxious state of mind. Now I knew what I had I thought where the fuck do I go from here? I\\'ve done hours and hours of CBT and theirs only so much they can tell you. I\\'ve been on and off Setraline for a year as I don\\'t find it works but it seems to be the go to drug for people with a social anxiety disorder. I\\'ve had to quit work and haven\\'t worked in over a year as I struggle to hold down a job and be around people. Theirs 3 people in my life I feel comfortable around my Dad, Mum  and Brother everyone else I can\\'t look them in the eye or hold a conversation with. Before any social event I will drink before I go out as I find alcohol gives me that confidence i need to socialise with people. I also use ketamine because as soon as I have some all the anxiety of being around people goes away. Now I know I\\'ve got my self into a terrible cycle and I can\\'t go on like this all my life, but what the fuck do I do? I\\'ve tried CBT I\\'ve tried setraline I\\'ve tried going to the gym and getting fit. Have I thought about Suicide? Every fucking day I just think their is nothing that will work and I will never be able to get back to that social teenager I once used to be. I\\'m now 23 barely leave my room and if I do I have to drink before I do, this social anxiety has fucking crippled me I had the world at my feet and now? Well now I have a constant state of fucking worry. Anyway I\\'ve wrote this so if theirs anyone out their going though something similar your not on your own and if I find something that helps me with my social anxiety, I\\'ll be sure to let you know. I will one day get back to my normal socialising self, hold down a job and friendships and one day love life for what it has to offer again. This is the first time I\\'ve ever told this to anyone in such detail before as well.\\')', 'labels': ['not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect', 'related to an outdoor space with negative effect'], 'scores': [0.8993655443191528, 0.04153607785701752, 0.02958689257502556, 0.029511475935578346]}\n",

I\\'ve always struggled with social anxiety, and there is a possibility that I may have Avoidant Personality Disorder. I\\'m not really interested in categorizing it though, the real point is, I am very lonely and I want to make friends badly. The problem is, I have an extreme fear of talking to people. It\\'s strange because I have this running dialogue in my head almost all the time, but as soon as I want to talk to someone, my mind goes blank. There\\'s just... nothing there! Obviously striking up a conversation with someone you are sitting near in class would be a good way to go to make friends, but I have absolutely no idea how to even start a conversation like that let alone keep it going. In fact, it\\'s not even just talking. Walking to class, I have a hard time even making eye contact with people I pass by. I feel very awkward in these situations. However, I refuse to be controlled by my fears any longer. They don\\'t let me live life. So today, this girl sat down next to me in class, and after a LONG time of working up the courage, I asked her, \"Hey, we didn\\'t have any homework for this class yet, right?\" I know it\\'s pathetic but it\\'s all I could think of. I just wanted to say something. I guess what I\\'m trying to say is, I know the only way to get past this is to break out of my comfort zone, but I don\\'t even feel like I know how. Nothing to say comes into my mind. If anybody could help me with some tips to stop freaking out so much about what to say or maybe give me some good conversation starters that work for meeting people at school, that would be really great.

I only talk to 1 friend and we dont even see each other often too. Anyways. 1 week ago I went to my mom's friend's birthday party and I saw this girl I like (she is very shy like me) I said Hi to her and talked random stuff like 'How are you' 'What's your name' its all the basic stuff and 5 mins later we never spoken again because again I am just socially stupid and super shy. She didn't bother talking back to me because I THINK she is shy too or maybe she hates me??? Anyway, I got her Facebook profile the day after because for some reason her profile came up with on my 'do you know' list... anyway I added her and she accepted the friend request. We never chatted or anything, of course, but right now I want to start chatting to her, but here's the thing... wtf do I say???? In my mind do people go places like the cinema? food? shopping? I dunno? what are you suppose to do when you ask someone out? most importantly, I don't even know if she likes me so asking her if she is ok and then ask her if she likes watching movies and if she say yes then i will say 'Do you want to come to the cinema next week' Like that?

When I meet new people, I focus on my voice, how childish and soft spoken I sound. I am unsure of what to say, what facial expression to make, how to act. I look like a little kid, coordination disorder makes me sometimes position myself oddly, I can't problem solve with creativity which may sometimes make me appear dumb. I have ADD, but the kind where you hyper focus. I'm too good at paying attention to one thing, and it makes me narrow minded in situations with obvious solutions. It often makes me appear less intelligent then I actually am. I'm 5'11 and 115 pounds, my left eyelash turned white, my face is a bit discolored, my jaw is too large, my hair is probably messy, I need braces. Am I breathing enough, is my face red? I hope they don't notice. I always forget to smile, I may seem cold. I know if anything goes wrong, they'll feel just as embarrassed as I do. Do they think that I'm cold and mean? What if I come off as weird? It will be over soon, why do I care what they think? In social situations I'm too critical of myself and can't relax. It's difficult for me to make the right facial expressions, talk, and worry about my other negative traits that could ruin the interaction or the person's image of me. My insecurities can distract me and make me feel more nervous. When I'm comfortable and unintimidated of the person I'm talking to, I'm a different person. However, that doesn't make everything perfect. I don't really have a real personality. I have little to no empathy for anyone I don't know (I have some empathy for those I care about most), I'm not emotional, nothing anyone says hurts my feelings, I can easily lie no matter how terrible it is without feeling guilt. As a child until middle school, I liked to torture small lizards. I wanted to buy a cat as an adult and torture it. However, I realized it was quite wrong and that part of me is disturbing. I came from being a very emotional child to who I am gradually. I am virtually the same if you compare me to who I was a year ago and so on. No phases, no sudden changes. I always had anxiety for as long as I remember. Past 6 years old, I was never capable of real anger, I always had complete control over my actions. People said puberty and hormones would change me a lot, but it was easy for me and changed nothing about me. I have a strong will to live and have never suffered from depression even after all of this (despite it running on my mom's side of the family). I'm intelligent, have a high emotional intelligence, strong intuition, will power, strength, stubbornness, and have no personality. My voice tone changes so often, my personality and attitude switching, but only I notice. I often feel blank like nothing. My lifestyle would make any normal human feel pathetic and depressed, but not me. For the past 3 years I have been home schooled. Instead of studying I cheat, and pretend to be studying all day while in reality I'm playing video games (not even games that could have a violent or negative influence on me). That's how it is all day everyday, and I don't have friends. It's quite foolish, but I can get away with it, and I only study for SATs. I even had a bunch of friends before I became homeschooled, and I didn't miss them one bit. I'm honestly unsure if I would even cry if someone I loved died. I'm quite confused why I am me. My whole life, my chest was sunken inwards. When I started growing quickly it became a large sunken hole. I was insecure about it my whole life and got a dangerous and painful procedure to fix it recently. My father has anger issues (not physially abusive), from my point of view he's not like fire (anger), he's like boiling water (emotions). He holds grudges, his behavior or how he will react is unpredictable. He causes scenes in public sometimes. He's self-aware in some sense and tells me to never behave like him. He's a good teacher and father, and then he's not. He threatens me (of physical abuse). These things happen rarely, and that's because of how I act around him. Most of the time things are good and happy, but I don't feel comfortable. He doesn't truly take my comfort into consideration. I'm always walking on eggshells, and like him less as I get older. He talks about my mother like she's crazy or like she's stupid. My father has no idea how childish and messed up he actually is. When he's angry he will scream and get in my face and try to hurt my feelings, he will threaten me, mock me. He has no patience for stupidity, he will make fun of me, yell at me, he'll get angry if I'm not able to figure out a simple task (it always happened when I was a little child but not anymore). When I used to cry about how much I missed my mom he would yell at me. He's selfish, his feelings get hurt incredibly easily. On the surface we look like a happy family (and that's what he thinks), but I only adjust my personality for him to avoid any trouble so those occurrences never happen. My mom and dad split apart when I was a baby. It was a terrible divorce, and I ended up getting messed up as a toddler by my mother. I had ADHD at the time (which turned to ADD) and I would always try to look like a girl (because of my cousin one year older than me who was a girl). My mother is paranoid (may have some sort of disorder) and put me on medication. However, it made me go crazy. I was getting brought to doctors left and right, she was freaking out trying to figure out what was wrong. I'm not sure what they gave me, but it made me blink nonstop and act crazy. She ended up giving me to my father, who happily accepted me and moved away immediately. I was heart broken that I couldn't see my mom and cried so much. I missed her so badly and never got to see her. Thinking about how much I missed my mother even makes me feel like crying now. He made me become better after quite a rough time, and then my mom wanted me back. This resulted in lots of fighting and I ended up trying to get my dad in jail in a desperate attempt to be with my mom again (I was 6). I was able to convince people that my dad had abused me, and I ended up with my mom for 3 weeks. Everyone was fighting in court and I was transported to some hospital with a bunch of crazy kids without parents to care for them. My dad won with his intelligence, and I ended up with him. I rarely get to see my mom and half brother, and I really miss them. I see them every 3-4 months for a couple weeks. There is much more that's happened to me, but these are probably the most damaging things. I believe it's possible that I have inherited my moms traits. Both my mom and dad showed early signs of a sociopath as children (killing small animals, abused in different ways), but from what I hear about my mom, I probably inherited her traits. After all this time, my dad is still the same, but I believe my mom is a better person (or has fooled me to believe so in hopes that I will end up with her). If you met me, you'd never be able to fathom that what I wrote was true. I'm a kind, soft spoken, shy, energetic, quiet, intelligent, weird, serious, goofy, stubborn, absent minded, low energy person (and more). It's like I can't act how I truly think, I'm so much more than what I seem on the surface. Honestly, everything wrong with me should cancel each other out. I'm unsure of what I really have and what is emotional damage.')\", 'labels': ['not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'related to an outdoor space with negative effect', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect'], 'scores': [0.3757777810096741, 0.21278728544712067, 0.20882223546504974, 0.2026127129793167]}\n",

I'm 16 and I've never had any real friends, and whenever I was starting to develop friendships with people my anxiety would shut that down instantly and make it incredibly difficult for me to talk to them. I stopped going to school at age 13 because of my anxiety, I was constantly getting panic attacks and cold sweats, I couldn't focus on my work and everything scared me. This got my parents into a lot of legal trouble, and it seriously hurt my relationship with them, but I couldn't take school anymore, it was way too much and I wanted to do anything but school. I wish I could go to school without anxiety, I love talking to people and being with people I love, but my anxiety won't let me, all I can do is fantasize about that. I'm at the point where I've lost all hope, I feel as if nothing will ever change. My daily routine is just me dicking around online and I'm sick of it, it's so boring, but I have nothing else to do. My anxiety is everywhere, I can't get rid of it no matter how hard I try. I've talked about this with my psychologist (I think that's what they're called? The mental health version of a GP) but I find it really hard to talk about any of my problems there, they just run down a list of questions then end it. ''have you had any bad or suicidal thoughts lately? How have you been? So no changes? OK, see you next month''. It's pretty much that, I don't really have a chance to say what I want because I'm getting rushed to finish. I've mentioned smaller thing like ADHD and stuff but he didn't really help me with that much. So I don't see asking for help as much of an option, I also don't want my parents to find too much out about myself because it would probably worsen our relationship more. What is there to do anymore, I don't feel like there's anything I can do now, I have no control. I don't want to keep living like this, it's so boring and my emotions have gone numb. I seriously don't want to wake up tomorrow to do the same thing I've done yesterday, I'm so sick of it... If I told my doctor any of this, he'd have to tell my parents, if my parents found out I'm depressed and suicidal and have crippling anxiety they'd treat me with even less respect than they do now, I'm considered a failure, and I agree that I am one, I just don't want them to have more reason to tell me how much I fucked up my life and how ill never have another chance in life.

I\\'m very comfortable with my family and I feel completely free to be myself. I\\'ve spend my entire life without ever having any real friends outside of family. Now I\\'m attending college and I\\'m all alone and I feel like I\\'m wasting my life by not forming any new relationships. My entire life I\\'ve always had a hard time making friends. I feel like people think I\\'m weird and that they don\\'t want to talk with me. I feel like they are going to judge me and reject me. Now, I know this isn\\'t true, but its hard to combat this false belief for a number of reasons. I had this crippling fear growing up for ages. And because of this I never sought out any friends. Over time I think I convinced myself that I didn\\'t really want friends, that somehow I was a satisfied loner and that somehow the only things that mattered in life where the physical things. Rather than confronting my fears I just convinced myself that I didn\\'t need people. I avoided the problem. The problem just got worse. When I\\'m with my family I open up completely, I am my true self. I\\'m not worried what they think of me, I have literally no fear. When I meet someone else who isn\\'t in my family I close off completely. I don\\'t trust that person and I feel like I have to protect myself. I may seem like a quiet, calm person on the outside, but on the inside I am scared. I\\'m scared someone is going to reject me or call me weird or strange. I\\'m scared they are going to avoid me or that somehow they will be disgusted by me. I know this isn\\'t true, but its in my head because I\\'ve told it to myself for so many years. And honestly, because I\\'ve avoided this problem for so many years I am in reality a little bit socially awkward now. I\\'m 21 years old and I\\'m in college and I feel so alone. I feel like I\\'m missing out on an exciting life because of fear. I\\'m not an extrovert, but still, I need some relationships in my life. I need a space where I can be myself and feel loved and accepted by other people. I want to feel confident in who I am with strangers. I want to feel powerful and secure. I\\'m scared to open up to people and let them into my world because I feel that either they are weird or that they are going to think that I am weird. Logically I know that I need to just get out there and talk to people and just be myself. And yes even though I\\'m going to get rejected and kicked in the teeth a few times, eventually I\\'m going to get better and I\\'m going to feel more comfortable making friends. I know its a matter of just doing it, but still, its remarkably hard for me. When I try to make new friends or be part of a group sometimes its really hard because I\\'m not talented socially and I sometimes do make some really awkward moments. Sometimes in trying to \"just be myself\" I forget who I really am. Sometimes when it hurts, I go back to that comforting lie that I don\\'t really need people. I know these are all just setbacks that can be worked through, but still its hard. lol. Its sooo much easier to just go and play video games in my spare time than to force myself to go make friends. Lol, I\\'ve thought about this so many times, but I still don\\'t have the answer. I still can\\'t open up to other people. I dont know if I\\'m coming off as too needy or if I\\'m annoying them or if I\\'m sharing too much. I feel like an outsider. I feel like everyone knows how to speak a language that I don\\'t know.

            "{'sequence': \"('My social anxiety is ruining my life and I don't think I'm getting the help I need. I have had pretty debilitating social anxiety for most of my life, and it has had a profound impact on me. My doctor noted my high blood pressure (even though i eat well, am skinny, and walk a lot) and my frequent weight loss (I was already underweight and the first year of hs alone i lost 15+ lbs) and loss of appetite (some days I have so much anxiety I can't eat all day or else i get sick, and I went weeks barely eating anything before because of it). I had literally no friends in middle school and barely any in high school, and it just made the whole experience miserable and I regret so many things that I couldn't do because of my social anxiety. I'm unable to make new friends and meet new people or apply for jobs, and it has affected my academic life considerably, and I have missed out on a lot of opportunities, experiences, and friendships because of it. A friend of mine applied to college and I decided I didn't want to miss out on another opportunity so I applied too and long story short he ended up hurting himself and put himself in the hospital and dropped out but I stayed and I didn't want college to be a re-run of high school and middle school where my social anxiety keeps me from having a normal happy life, so I talked to the campus therapist about it and she said my anxiety was pretty bad and highly recommend I see the nurse practitioner, so I did and I was prescribed Lexapro. I was on it for a few weeks and this did nothing to help my anxiety, and I told her it wasn't helping and she upped the dose but it still didn't help, and I told her this but she seems confident in continuing in this manor. I have regular panic attacks everyday and for the past few weeks it has been so bad that I cannot even go out and have missed a lot of class, consequently effecting my grades, and this just adds on the anxiety I already have. I also lost a lot of weight that I really shouldn't be losing, barely ever eat, never talk to people, and I picked up smoking cigarettes recently to try to help with the constant panic attacks, and it gives some relief but I really don't want a cigarette habit. At this point I'm willing to do anything that will help. Edit: I also thought that I should talk about an experience that I had at my high school prom. I went alone and had a pretty bad time and even though I went to school with everyone there since elementary school, I felt like a stranger and like I was at a party of people that I didn't know at all, and was just in a constant state of anxiety and depression because I was the only loser there without a date and everyone was having so much fun, and were having one last great get together after a fun 4 years of hs and I felt like I just barely scraped by and I hated myself for not being able to have friends and not doing anything fun in high school and missing out on what was suppose to be one of the best experiences of my life. My friend is prescribed adderall and his girlfriend took some of it recreationally at prom and my friend offered me some (which he offered me before but i declined because I get kinda paranoid about trying drugs) but I was like fuck it - tonight can't possibly get any worse, so i split a 20mg with him (because I was too paranoid to take the full 20) and took 10mg and about 30 minutes after-when it kicked in- I no longer had the burden of my social anxiety. Having no social anxiety felt like I found a piece of my life that I was missing all along, and I just felt normal for once in my life. It was just unexplainable how it felt to not only be around people, but talk to people too and NOT have constant panic attacks and be able to talk so fluently without second guessing myself and overthinking everything I was gonna say. I ended up talking to some people that I haven't talked to since freshman year, made a few new friends, and even danced a bit (which are all things I would have NEVER dreamed of doing in a million years, and I loved that I was able to do it). This is the only time in recent memory where I didn't have social anxiety from being in public like that. I was also able to eat in public too, which I usually never do because I have no appetite at all if I'm anxious and Im anxious all the time in public, and will refrain from eating in front of people, even if I'm really hungry and haven't ate in a while. I feel like this is something I would like to bring up to the campus therapist or nurse practitioner when I see them again, but I don't know how they would feel about me admitting to using medication illicitly like that. I would like your guys' opinion on that as well if you wouldn't mind.

I know many will say medication isn’t the best solution to anxiety, as you need to keep using it to deal with the anxiety as oppose to learning how to deal with it on your own, but for many this isn’t a feasible option and medication is needed. I have been on Lexapro for about a month and it has done nothing to help my anxiety at all, but I have tried a few drugs illicitly to help with my anxiety and the ones I found the most effective are (in no particular order): Amphetamine Salts (Adderall) - imo the best drug for social anxiety, with the fewest negatives. Makes me very sociable and talkative and makes me very smooth and attentive when conversating, gets rid of all my physical and mental anxiety, is pretty long lasting and helps with asthma, and with ADHD and can help people concentrate and focus better but can cause appetite loss, insomnia, can have bad comedowns and isn’t good for you if you have a bad heart or are sensitive/get bad anxiety from stimulants Alcohol - pretty effective for anxiety for many (its called liquid courage after all), but not feasible for everyday use because of health dangers like liver damage and high risk for addiction and not good for many people as its very dependent on the specific users reaction to being buzzed/drunk and is very short lasting compared to other medications (effects last only about an hour or so) and as its not prescription you must pay out of pocket fully, which can be very costly and you must be 21 to buy it (in US) Alprazolam (Xanax) - the main drug people think of when they think of medication for anxiety (along with other benzodiazepines like Klonopin, and Valium). It has many negatives like its addictiveness, extreme sedation, and memory loss and can make you like a zombie, and on a side note is very dangerous to mix with alcohol for a number of reasons. It shouldn’t be used consistently for everyday relief of anxiety for these reasons but is good at its job and very effective for anxiety and can give people with debilitating anxiety some much needed relief from their symptoms Codeine - only tried a couple times a while ago (so i cant really give much information or experience) but i didn’t notice any problems with my anxiety while on it and outside talking to people , but its an opiate and not really meant for anxiety and can be very addictive and codeine specifically is very user dependent, as depending on your bodies metabolism, it releases an unknown amount of morphine (if interested I recommend you look into this, codeine even as a pain killer is pretty dangerous and hit or miss depending on your body). I don’t recommend it but thought I should add it anyway Nicotine - helps a little bit with anxiety and stress, and can give you an excuse to leave a stressful situation or place and the habit of smoking could reduce anxiety but nicotine could also make anxiety worse with cravings and addiction, and is really addictive and depending on method of ingestion - like cigs - has a whole slew of bad effects with it like heart disease, cancer, etc. you also will have to pay out of pocket as it isn’t a prescription drug and can be very costly and (in the US) you need to be 18-21 depending on the location to buy it Marijuana - very hit or miss imo in regards to anxiety. It is probably the safest drug you can possibly do though, and helps you calm down and relax and relieve stress but tends to make me not wanna be social and make me anxious sometimes and gives a lot of people paranoia and can worsen anxiety (but this is very dependent on the strain and setting). Also it’s basically only available illegally (in the US, legal only in a few states), unlike the other meds on this list, so you will be paying exclusively out of pocket for it. I noticed that the weed comedown (the cloudy kind of dreamy feeling you get for a few hours after the high wares off) relieves my anxiety sometimes as well Those are the main ones that come to mind, but i would love to hear what you guys have tried that helped you or hear some stories of your experiences with different medications and how they affected your anxiety')\", 'labels': ['not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with negative effect', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect'], 'scores': [0.45897942781448364, 0.20865370333194733, 0.17499063909053802, 0.1573762744665146]}\n",

One day i\\'ll be the mos outgoing guy ever but the next week i\\'ll be the quiet weird kid in the back. When these thoughts are crowding my head i always look up the same questions and discussions about depression/social anxiety. It\\'s like i\\'m looking for the right answer to help me but none of them work. I hate motivational speeches and tips from people online. It\\'s always the same; get fit, talk to yourself, go outside, record your thoughts etc... dumb stuff like that. that way of thinking is too simple, depression can not be cured with those generic tips used by every normal person. I\\'m also too self-aware, i hate alot of people including myself, toxic thoughts intrude the back of my head 24/7 even though i ignore them because i know i\\'m decent human being. I am lowkey racist to everyone including my own(blacks), i identify with cowards, villains, socially awkward nerds, and bad people in general. I act like i\\'m the most progressive sjw guy in public, but it\\'s really an act to protect my image. I just want to come out and release all my toxic thoughts, and tell all the people i hate to fuck off and die. I feel bad for killers, rapist, terrorist and idiots because i sympathize with their struggles. I could never admit that to people even on the internet without being crucified by everyone. I like to research these terrible humans(see i\\'m acting like a good guy right now) and understand how they turned out this way. Normal(normies lol) humans don\\'t think like this; normal people hate their guts and want them to suffer for eternity... I do believe they should be punished but i also wish for them to get helped and re-assimilated into society. See, these types of thoughts hunt my mind. Sometimes i feel enlightened or too self aware for my own good but really i\\'m just an average guy with above average grades. I\\'m not the brightest(you can tell by my grammar) but i like to think i\\'m intelligent. I know i\\'m better than most people in my grade, i hate losing to people i know i\\'m better than. League of legends is my biggest example; I have been silver for three years, never truly improving even though i KNOW i have gotten smarter  and better at the game. However i\\'m still not god enough to carry myself out of low elo. Inb4 the motivational tips and quotes, just don\\'t... I hate them all because they never help me! I\\'ve seen some really good motivational tips from the internet, school, family etc... They\\'re all useless to me. I know i must be willing to improve myself in order to take in these tips but i just can\\'t! I want to improve, i really do but i feel like i\\'m not strong enough to function in society. My self worth is non existence because they\\'re are tons of very intelligent people in the world while i\\'m just your average guy with no self-esteem. I envy my peers; watching them get awards and scholarships for their success while i\\'m part of the dumbass club. Most of my friends are smart people but they can also be real ass holes to me like everybody i talk to. The reason they\\'re assholes to me is because i\\'m a shitty guy; they clearly enjoy talking to me sometimes but usually i get ignored when they find someone better to talk to. I\\'ve never had close friends, never had a girlfriend and never been truly cared for other than my family. Don\\'t even think of telling me to make new friends and get interesting hobbies lol! That\\'s one of those shitty generic tips i hear all of the time. It\\'s not easy finding a new hobby and i can\\'t make true friends without changing myself from the core up. Actually i have made some new friends who i enjoy talking too but i don\\'t like talking to them for too long cause i\\'m an introvert. Also i rather talk to my other friends but it hurts being clearly unwanted when they\\'re talking to each other while ignoring me. I can\\'t stand being around a group of people having a good time while i\\'m sitting near them. It makes me realize how shitty my life is, but i can\\'t just drown in my depression. I guess you could say the countless motivation i\\'ve gotten and seen others get have peer pressured me into not killing myself... I am scared of letting down my family because they\\'ve put so much trust  and love into me. so i refuse to go back to the old 12 year old me that couldn\\'t even speak to my family. However i do contemplate killing myself everytime these toxic thoughts intrude my mind again. I can\\'t stand seeing happy people especially on reddit... I\\'m a very cynical person and i love criticizing everything regardless of how much i like it. When i see toxic people get flammed because of their stupidity i feel bad for them. When i see someone with an onion outside of the hivemind get downvoted, i upvote them. When i see people insulting shitty humans and calling them monsters, roasting them alive i want to downvote them all; hell sometimes i even cry for bad people depending on their childhood. I have no political stance and i don\\'t care what happens to most people except myself, my family and sometimes my race(blacks). I feel like a disappointment because black people are some of the most progressive, outspoken and consist of the most normies out of any race imo. When blacks look at me, they fear me because i\\'m a socially awkward weirdo or they might think of me as a coon(my worst fear) if i speak up for other races. Like my family and black people in general are very seclusive, we stick up for ourselves, distrusting other races and insulting them the most. I stick up for black power and all the progressive yatta yatta but also feel like we have a since of elitism that i dislike. I want to understand every human being regardless of how terrible they are, especially the bad ones. I think serial killers are interesting even though they\\'re still evil people. I think supervillains are badass. I like seeing violence and destruction even though i shouldn\\'t feel this way. I like watching people die and i love fights. I don\\'t care if the bad side wins nor the good side. As long as i\\'m entertained and safe i\\'m happy; see these things are my true self but i can never talk to people about them without being hated. Yes i admire all the strong good people in the world but i just can\\'t identify with the  and it harms my soul. I love good writing: action, fantasy, drama, crime, suspense etc... Especially in anime but alot of anime have a clear cast of good guys while the villains are written to be atrocious monsters with no sense of humanity. I hate that! I like to know why the \"villain\" is like the way they are, usually their stories are more interesting than the heroes. However life doesn\\'t work that way. The majority of human beings are good people while shitty people rot in the dark corners of society. No normal people want to hear our outcries because our ways of thinking are harmful to society. I love to debate controversial topics and listen to intelligent people\\'s arguments without being dismissed as a terrible human being. I really am not this shitty and i do love humanity but i just can\\'t identify with all the, happy, sunshine and rainbows humanity thrives to be. I like conflict but i\\'m also a coward. I don\\'t want humanity to suffer because i want to be safe. However i like seeing conflict arouse in the streets. I hate using the term \"sjw\" but i feel like that term really does make sense. People are praised way too much  and regarded as saints without realizing their flaws. Not everybody can turn out to be a social activist or a leader of a community. Some people are shunned from society because of our introversion, social awkwardness and controversial thinking. I like good people, but i don\\'t praise good people. I enjoy watching these people progress while their flaws reveal to the public at the same time. That\\'s why i hate celebrities! Too many celebs are perceived having perfect lives and they are valued more than the average man. If i died nobody would care except my family. I\\'m just a speck in the universe, not even known by the 1%... While some really stupid people such as the catch me outside girl become rich and famous... But i realize i\\'m drowning too much int he darkness, i need to start thinking positive and helping myself. It\\'s all a coping mechanism in the end. I\\'m constantly debating my inner thoughts, changing my mind by everything 24/7. I know i\\'m wrong in a lot of aspects but i\\'m also different, i thrive to be unique but that\\'s a wishful dream. I\\'m positive tons of other people are just like me: confused, heartbroken, introverted, too self-aware, jealous, hateful but smart at the same time. I\\'m always thinking about life, i\\'m always thinking twice about what someone said 7 hours earlier. I\\'m always examine body gestures and coming up with deep thoughts about people. I feel like the majority of people care about themselves and don\\'t think twice about others they don\\'t care about. However i care about EVERYBODY! I may be selfish but i truly care about people\\'s mental state. I love the psychology of the human mind. I love realizing what somebody truly meant when they gave a vague answer to a friend confused about their response. In the end none of this matters. My inability to change into a better human being hinders my thoughts being worthy of listening to. I\\'m always against the hivemind. While the majority agrees on a result that everyone should agree on. I like to think outside of the box. However alot of things i think of would not be liked by the masses. I don\\'t really believe in the toxic thoughts in my head, i just want to converse with others. I like changing the way i think and i like having my thoughts proven wrong but most people would rather shun me and talk to normal people. Sometimes i feel too intelligent for my own good but the sad truth is i\\'m not even that smart. Alot of my peers have better grades and an abundance of achievements. Wouldn\\'t you think these people are more worth listening to than me? Intelligent people rule the world but intelligence is judged to much on a scale. You can\\'t be a dreamer with low self confidence and a lack of drive to work hard. Intelligent people are hard workers, A students and confident in themselves. I\\'m the opposite; lazy, decent grades and low-self esteem. However i still o believe i\\'m underestimated. Their tons of people in this world that just don\\'t fit into society but are truly worth listening to.If you don\\'t follow the masses than you\\'re a nobody. I don\\'t want to be a leader nor a follower. I simply want to observe humanity, debate with others and enjoy life. My dream is too get an ok job that pays well so i can play video games, watch anime and browse the internet all day. Unfortunately life is not that easy. Adults always tell us how hard life is and i agree. Becoming an adult is scary, 2 years from now i will be 18. I don\\'t want to get all these responsibilities thrown on me. Hell i rather not work, life off welfare  and stay with my parents but that\\'s called being worthless to society. I want to do something that revolves around talking about the world. i enjoy the a concept of journalism and media but i\\'m afraid that journalism may be dying. The hard part is connections  and work... Careers revolve around connections. If you don\\'t know anybody then you can\\'t become anybody. If you don\\'t put in the time to work hard you won\\'t be acknowledged by others. Society kills me, i want to work but i don\\'t want to work hard. I con\\'t want to become a loser working a fast food chain or some store for the rest of my life. I just want to get a real job that allows me to enjoy my simple hobbies. It\\'s unfortunate that my interested career is a very competitive one that rewards the hard working the smartest. I might as well give up on it but i know i\\'m setting my self for failure. I\\'m a lost cause. I don\\'t know what i want to focus on, i enjoy alot of things but i don\\'t want to work hard to achieve a certain one. I know i need ot build skills with different things so i cna be successful but why do we need to work so ahrd to own an apartment, pay bills, watch anime  and play games. Don\\'t tell me i\\'m lazy(i know) and don\\'t try giving motivational tips  and advice. I detest them. I can not follow up on your advice so it\\'s better not giving it to me. I just need someone to talk to. If only i could escape from this world intro one of those generic anime shows. However that\\'s cowardly; i can\\'t just run away from my problems, they must be fixed by me, myself,  and I. I wish i had the motivation to do that but motivation does\\'t work for me. Ironically intimidation and discipline sort of works but eventually i turn against it. I\\'m not easily intimated because i know most tough people(military people for example) are just bluffing. If they use violence than they\\'re no better than me. I am a coward. If i see injustice i look the other way. I don\\'t believe in stereotypes but alot of them are lowkey true. I respect women and i act progressive. Secretly in my head i\\'m scared of change. I hate how progressive we have to be. I like diversity but it sucks when your favorite chracter has been changed into a minority/women when they could\\'ve written a well developed character instead. I feel like people attack our safe spaces such as 4chan, criticizing our toxic thoughts(i don\\'t identify with most of them) wanting us to change. How can we change if ya\\'ll ridicule us without trying to help us? Yes alot of toxic people are straight up racist and dumb but their are some of that want to change. We just can\\'t if people shun us, dismissing us with all the other losers. At the end of the day, i\\'m wrong. Women, minorities, and my people has been shunned by the white men(hope i don\\'t offended any white people) for too long, now were fighting back. My inclusion with nerdy communities has given me some of these toxic thoughts. I almost seem coonish but i\\'m just scared how far we are gonna change my hobbies with minorities/women. Everything I\\'ve just said in this little essay all are from the roots of my introversion as a little boy. I wish i was never obsessed with gaming/anime and my parents would\\'ve made me go outside lol. I know i can change if i really wanted to but pls don\\'t preach to me with motivational shit. I said a million times it just doesn\\'t work. If you made it this far... CONGRATULATIONS  and thank you for reading! I don\\'t know where i\\'m going with this rant, i started this essay out as a cry for help, but i needed to release all my thoughts. I guess i just want people to read this, and if you do, thx for reading through all my grammatical mistakes. I just need to vent my frustrations out into the world without being attacked.\\')', 'labels': ['not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect', 'related to an outdoor space with negative effect', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect'], 'scores': [0.2797929644584656, 0.2430683821439743, 0.24083757400512695, 0.2363010048866272]}\n",

            "{'sequence': \"('Raging hatred on one of my teachers. What to do? (long). The chance of having a perfect day in school is literally impossible. I’m always worried about the little things that happened earlier in the day, the things that made me feel awful, and it puts me in a bad mood. Right now is one of those moments so I need to vent. So in Pottery class, we’re working on our Sgriffito seed jar projects where you coat a ball of clay with red slip and then carve it to reveal the brown clay underneath. The whole process is lengthy, fun, but also makes you worry because you have to detail it without making it look messy. Copying my 2D art design onto this fist-sized sphere is not as easy as I thought, but it’s important for me to complete this project because this is our ‘finals’ for the semester. This isn’t a super-advanced class. In fact, most of my classmates, including me, took it for an easy A+ because it’s supposed to be an easy class. This class is not easy for me at all. The main reason is because of my teacher. Here’s a list why: 1) He’s the type of teacher who assigns you a seat alphabetically for the whole semester. My last name starts with a B, so of course I sit in the front of the classroom. I HATE sitting in the front because most people behind me can see me clearly and I prefer to be invisible. I also shake when I feel like I’m being watched. 2) He’s the type of teacher that makes you fill out a paper with personal questions and then share them with the class. Did this at the beginning of the school year. I answered one of the questions in a different way than my classmates and was forced to share that specific answer. The answer was totally different and completely wrong compared to everyone else’s. No one said anything. Embarrassing. 3) The type that makes you feel stupid for making small mistakes. He always says things like “I don’t know where you got that from, we never learned it that way.” Then he shows how to do it and says, “This is how we’ve always learned it, right?” And he does it REALLY often. Sometimes it’s a different variety of this example and the belittling makes you feel stupid. He often says “It’s easy” after reminding you how to do something properly when you did it wrong the first time. (When he says this, he means that listening to him the first time and getting everything right is ‘easy’.) 4) The type that calls on you when you don’t raise your hand. Sometimes when we are given a handout to read, we get like 5 minutes to read the whole thing and then answer questions from the teacher about what we just read. Without looking at the paper. Every time we do something like this and I get called on, my mind goes blank. 5) The type who’s unreasonable when you’re doing something a different way. I was smoothing the inside of my clay mug and collaring the mug afterwards. The teacher said, “Do it how we’ve learned it. We don’t make stuff up.” Then he proceeded to tell me how to collar the clay even though I already knew. I was JUST SMOOTHING THE INSIDE. And of course, my anxiety prevented me from saying anything to him. 6) The type that hates the sight of electronic devices. If he sees you on your phone, he’ll tell you to put it away and yap about distractions. He’s strict about having them out in the open. We can only have them out on Friday to listen to music, or look up reference designs for our clay projects. If we’re on a social media or whatever, everyone loses the privilege to use their phone. When I think about it, he’s probably someone who’d go against net neutrality. He’s old-looking too. 7) The type that forces you to turn around in your seats when he’s talking because he thinks we don’t have ears when we’re turned the other way. If you don’t look at him, he’ll tell you to turn around in your stool, or ask you if you’ve been listening to him. 8) The type who expects you to come in after class for incomplete projects even though he doesn’t give you enough time to work on them. Happens so many times because the teacher takes up our work time with his lectures. 9) The type that makes you go up to him multiple times to sign off handouts/designs before glazing or starting a project, and then making you look stupid if you didn’t do it right even though he wasn’t being specific. 10) The type that will snatch tools out of your hands to show you the ‘proper way’ to get it done. 11) The type that will grab your clay project and show you how it’s done instead of telling you how to do it on your own. (I don’t want your disgusting finger marks on my project.) 12) The type of teacher that makes you write useless notes. (I DON'T CARE where this or that originated.) 13) The type of teacher that quizzes you on pointless things. Like making us rewrite the steps on how to do this or that. 14) The type to harshly grade you. It’s always required to have handouts signed off by HIM when turning them in. And you can only have them signed off on a specific day so it’s either a hit or miss. I don’t like how that’s an important piece in the grading system of this class. Had a project where I had to make 2 stamps and 2 rollers. Did all what I was supposed to do, except had NO TIME to make 2nd roller. I got a grade in the sixties. All of my hard effort felt wasted and I was upset. Also, I still believe I shouldn’t dedicate time outside of class to finish these things. NONE of our work is heavily based on effort. My grade is deteriorating for these reasons, and when the teacher noticed one day, he told me to come in and finish my incomplete project(s). However, I am not dedicated enough to give up time after school, my lunch period, or the only period I have that allows me to relax (shortest period). I also refuse to go in during a study hall because I realized that his class is empty during that period and I feel uncomfortable being in there alone. So anyway, we are required to make a 4” tall pedestal for the ball, which my group already did two days ago. Today, my group was supposed to make another pedestal if our current one was not strictly 4” tall. Fuck. I didn’t want to go on the wheel, and ruin the new sweater I was wearing. You know how messy things can get when using the wheel? Clay particles fly, it gets in the hair, the clothes, the shoes, the face. It gets onto the mini stool you sit on, and possibly on the bottom of your pants. The stained aprons don’t help. So I decided I wanted to be clean today and work on my seed jar instead. At that point, my teacher told my group that we could work on our seed jars if we showed him our pedestals were 4”. I measured mine and it was 3.5”. I was probably the only one who didn’t reach 4”, but who cares. 3.5” looks perfectly fine and pretty close. I turned it into the back for firing and started working on my seed jar. I think my teacher witnessed part of it, because later on while I’m carving, the teacher calls my name. I looked over my shoulder with indistinct annoyance and he asked: Him: Are you in group 1? Me: Yes. Him: Then you should be on the wheel. Me: I already have a pedestal. Him: Did you show it to me? Me: No. Him: Then you should be on the wheel. His facial expression is blank and that’s what triggers my anxiety. The second time he said, “Then you should be on the wheel,” I was beyond annoyed. It’s difficult for me to create things on the wheel. The pedestal I made two days ago was perfect enough, and I didn’t want to go through the whole process again… but I knew I had to show him the pedestal if I wanted to continue working on my project. Maybe he’d let the 3.5” pass? I stood up to get my pedestal and he continued talking to me with my back turned. I couldn’t understand what he said because I was so flustered. I got the ruler, my pedestal and returned to him. It was awkward being there and I tried to stall the situation. He didn’t check the height himself, and I had to check in front of him. I often paused and then asked him if it had to be exactly 4” tall. He said that it could be 4” or higher. He watched with a silent, blank stare and waited for my answer while I measured the stupid pedestal. I pretended not to know what the height was and just muttered, “no,” after he asked if it was 4”. He said that I should’ve been on the wheel and asked if I was even listening to what he said earlier. I was silent because I was choking up. Then he asked me why I wasn’t on the wheel. I wanted to say, “Because I already have a pedestal and don’t give a shit about the height,” and “I don’t want to waste my time trying to make another pedestal with the possibility that I won’t even make another one because I suck,” but I just told him that I preferred to work on the seed jar and he figured so. My voice was weak. Then he went on about some nonsense. He talked about making preferences in life, and then talked about how the semester is ending and I’m almost done with pottery. I had no clue what he was talking about because the only thing I could concentrate on was his oval punchable face, his ugly gray hairstyle, and his annoying, impassive stare. I kept nodding like I was paying attention. Sometime after that, I snatched the carving tools from my work-area and headed back to the desk he was sitting at to put them away. He stopped me and started spewing out more shit. He said I could go on the wheel next week when group 2 is on the wheels, and that he’d expect me to be making a 4” tall pedestal. I asked if I could do that instead of using the wheel today and he said yes. I went to put away my ruler and started tearing up because of my useless attempts to defend myself. So… I worked on the seed jar. Didn’t get much done. I feel like every time I try to work on something, THIS teacher GETS in the way and wastes my time. The whole situation made me livid. I don’t care if my grade dips into a C anymore, in fact, I don’t care at all this school year. I’m damn tired of making mistakes, dealing with a bunch of people who won’t leave me alone, and teachers that SUCK at teaching. I keep falling behind in this damn pottery class. I don’t understand how everyone makes something unique and beautiful and then when I try, my shit breaks and I don’t finish the designs I want; like my box project that I’ve worked really hard on last week. I didn’t get to add the handle and extra designs on the outside and I was told it was incomplete when I turned it in (I didn’t give a shit if it wasn’t done). Then I got the opportunity to add these things. It was difficult to add onto this dry clay box but I added 5 pieces to it: a handle, and 4 extra design-pieces. I stored it away and planned on turning it in the next day. So the next day when I take it out, 3 of the small pieces fall off when unwrapping it. The handle and other small piece is still there but I don’t care at this point. The handle, which is a leaf lying on the flat side, is sitting nice and snug at the top. Can’t fall off. When the box is fired 2 days later, the fucking handle and remaining piece I’ve added had fallen off which DOESN’T MAKE SENSE because THOSE PIECES WERE STUCK ON GOOD WHEN I TURNED IT IN. Literally half of my projects have ended up lost and or broken for UNKNOWN reasons and then I’m EXPECTED to come in to finish this shit. Sometimes, I get suspicious that the teacher is sabotaging my projects, but I have no proof. He often told me that ‘nature happens.’ Wait, I have some more. This teacher is SO annoying, he made one of my classmates, T, drop the curriculum because of his constant criticizing. T was always bothered by this teacher, like me, and had frequent talks with the teacher for doing something the ‘wrong way’. T was also gay, and I feel like that’s why the teacher and him were having issues; because T was different, like I am different. The teacher was such a pest to him, that he dropped out of the class in the middle of the semester. Now I’m isolated in the corner with no one to talk to and or connect my projects to. It sucks to have T gone. We never really talked, but he was a nice person to be around. I don’t know what to do. Should I skip the wheel next week and continue working on my final project? Or should I suck it up and (possibly) waste my time trying to make another pedestal on the wheel, only for it to end up as a literal pile of shit in the scrap bucket (like many other times with previous projects)? How do I deal with my teacher and myself? I can never really say much to him because of my anxiety and I don’t care at this point if I get in trouble. I’ve never gotten in trouble in school before, but this teacher and his curriculum really CUTS ITS for me. Sitting at a B-minus. Worst Friday ever. Me: -Junior, 16 years old, female. -I never talk to anyone unless spoken to. -Severe anxiety ever since 5th grade. None of my parents know... -Extremely sensitive and will tear up easily. -1 best friend, 2 acquaintances. Best friend is sick today so I feel awfully lonely.

Well, what I'm experiencing all the time is that I'm on edge, stressed, and if I have to talk with somebody I always feel lump in my throat. When I was in basic school, I couldn't wait to go to High school, I wanted to start a new life, turn the page over and start fresh again, ( I should add that I was bullied all the time, not on a physical level but mentally ). The thing is I haven't changed at all, when I was in a freshman year we went on our first trip with my classmates. I remember that at some point, I was in my room, and I heard my classmates, laughing and having fun in the corridor, I wanted to go there, but I felt unreasonably scared. I even started crying because of it. Another year went by, I'm in a sophomore year and me and my few classmates have an animation class, we were in a room for photo shooting, and we were practising editing of green screen. We were supposed to take funny photos of ourself that we would edit later on. As soon as I realised it I was trembling, I was sweating and my heart started to beat really fast. When it was my turn I started to panically pleading my teacher to not take photos of me, I was so hysterical that my teacher said, '' Did your family member died during a photoshoot or something? '' Eventually she gave up, she tried to persuade me one more time when my teacher got the idea to take a group photo of all the animators ( my 6 classmates ) but I refused. We were done with taking photos, as soon as I opened the door I felt such, such an unexplainable relief. I've experienced these '' panic attacks '' quite a lot recently, I never thought of having social anxiety, I was trying to not think about it but then I realised that High school ends for me in a year and half, I have two options: 1. I will try to get accepted into college, 2. if I will fail I will need to find a job. And in no way I can imagine myself in an interview, I remember that I wanted to go on a part-time job during holidays, I found something neat on the internet, but I had to call there. I was walking around my room, sweating, anxious, I was rehearsing every word I was going to say in my head. And after an hour or so, I was looking on my phone, trying to press the button and it happened, accidentally. I freaked out but I was trying to stay calm, I put my mobile phone to my ear. Eventually we started talking, she said '' how old are you again? '' she asked, '' I'm 17, actually. '' I responded, and then she said '' ooh okay ha ha you sound so young! '' My voice gets really high when I feel anxious, so that made feel really bad after the call. We agreed on a appointment but I never went there because I was too scared. I have a lot of stories like that, I've actually noticed that I'm more anxious if people around me are in groups ( friends talking to each other etc.) well here is everything I feel in some social situations. : - If I hear someone laugh I feel that they're laughing at me. - I experince sweating - when I know something is going to happen, like an event or something I constantly think about it, for instance I was thinking of going to the psychologist, I was thinking about it for 2 months before I said something to my mother, I will go to the psychologist on Monday and I'm so..so scared, I'm still thinking about it, to the point when it gets extremely annoying. - I bite inside of my mouth when I'm stressed - if I do something awkward I usually think of that moment another day or so. - I'm scared to ask strangers a simple question like '' excuse sir, please where is ---- '' . - I'm scared to express happiness for some reason - people think that I'm a sarcastic asshole, yes I can be sarcastic on the internet but I mean it jokingly and I usually apologize, but if I say something sarcastic in real life I'm too scared to apologize, then if I think of apologizing again my brain goes '' oh it's too late you can't apologize now! '' and so on and so on BUT what I need to say that I'm not afraid of going to a mall, I'm only kinda stressed when I need to go to the cashier. BUT I hate crowded places, everytime I'm in a crowded place I feel like running. I'd love to explain more but I think this post is too long, I always explain everything in detail. just in case.

I can say that I struggle with social anxiety for last 5 years and I am almost 21 years old. It is very painful to live with it and I am waiting for a visit in new clinic in Netherlands so I hope they will help me with it. Nonetheless I\\'d like to tell you how social anxiety affects my life. Last Friday I got fired from work. I was suspecting that before so I will probably on monday to new job. I wasn\\'t a bad worker, I was working as psychical worker (easy job if other people do not make mistakes) I was doing good and I also could do other duties of other people if it was needed, learning everything very fastly. Social Anxiety was the problem. I felt there very uncomfortable, fearing any conflict between me or other person because of humiliation. I do not know when it started, but anxiety about it is just preventing me from talking to anyone in work. The most funny thing is that I was a liked person in work and other people didn\\'t joke about me or try to offend me. I only got nickname \"More Life\" because one guy every day said to me \"More life man\". No problem at work with duties or people but I still felt very bad there, to point where I took sick-leave to not go to work because of it. I was often absent at work, and I got informed from other worker that I can get fired soon, so I founded already new job. But again, new work, new people and constant fear because of people surrounding me. It is so greatly affecting me that I loose jobs because of it, I resignated going college because of fear being a \"freak\" around other normal students, not understood by anyone. I fear any contact with other uknown person that I feel only good at home alone. I live alone without any family around or friends, still I am functioning, but I am very sad about my life. I had no real girlfriend because of anxiety. I stopped hanging with any friends because of it. I can not go to outside world. Right now the only place I sit is my room. I deleted all social media accounts to separate from others. Now it\\'s impossible for me to connect to other. I realize that I am not that bad at all, in many many aspects I am better than others, but previous years and episodes what happened then hit me so hard that I so awkard.... Eye contact, starting conversation etc. it\\'s like jumping into fire. I fear more of it than any other thing in my life. I try but I can\\'t stop to think what other people will think. My self-esteem is very low in fact, so any critic of my person is very painful. I try to avoid any place or situation where I could be an object of laught or critic. Constant feeling that people watch etc. You understand what I mean. There\\'s also problem of conflict, I really do not know what to say, if someone attacks me verbally I get paralyzed. I didn\\'t had this problem before, but after few years of anxiety I have it also. If I would take off this anxiety, my life would be so fucking better, but no. Instead I sit in house every single weekend for last year. And the longer I am doing this the worse it gets. You do not know then how to talk to people, about what should I talk and you can\\'t tell any stories because life is total boredom. I suppose many people have similiar limit put over their lives. I try to be positive about future and I want to treat my SA, but deep inside me is a feeling that I will not fight it. Everytime I met a girl I got so panicked that I avoid any verbal contact. What makes me more sad is that I changed a lot, I lost a lot of weight, my body looks much better, but nothing helps me with Social Anxiety. I really do not know what to do now. My last hope for now is mental clinic and therapy (CBT), and if that will not work, then suicide probably will come back to phase of planning. It just how I desperate I am.

My family isn\\'t very social but rather reserved; social anxiety also runs like a mofo in our genes. So you can tell where I\\'m coming from. As a result, I grew up to be kinda antisocial and only went out with my friends once or twice in the past, mainly in middle school. Pretty much, I was destined to be a tacit Pakistani engineer that has a six figure job, and a virginity reserved for an arranged marriage at 52. Now I\\'ve been really trying to escape my shell, but it\\'s been backfiring, as if I\\'m missing a tooth in the key (or some other poetic shit). Like today, I was walking out of a bathroom stall only to encounter a group of guys huddled up. I said \"hi\" and they looked at me as if bigfoot just took an epic shit, and said \"um...lets get away from him...\", and darted out. When I finally develop the courage talk to people, I always come across as condescending and caustic, which is exactly the opposite of how I want to sound. This causes people to avoid me, like I\\'m invisible. When I try to speak in a softer voice, I\\'m completely inaudible, and my voice becomes a background hum followed by \"what?\", assuming that anyone is actually listening. When I introduce myself, I\\'m always awkward no matter how much confidence I\\'m trying to feign. If the stars align and someone does respond, it\\'s usually along the lines of \"um...who is this dude and why is he talking to me?\" The words always come out wrong or as some dumb, incoherent shit. Every time during a conversation, my mind just goes blank, like a sheet of copy paper. Talking to girls, as you can see, is a nightmare.

If I don\\'t talk to people, same thing: I\\'m seen as an arrogant douchebag. I can\\'t even smile genuinely. My mind is always convoluted with random ass shit and what other people think. Whenever I do smile, people think I\\'m high and run away. If I don\\'t, people get intimidated.

This just told me that I was too ugly to go outside and socialise, so I never did. That was a good 6 years ago now. I\\'ve tried to work on myself. I got a haircut, I grew some facial hair, I dressed properly, and it seemed like my face developed a bit more. I still didn\\'t get any attention, compliments or interest from girls though. Well, until last year where I hooked up with this beautiful girl off Tinder. She was actually my first \\'everything\\' in an intimate sense, which is bad to admit considering I did it with a random Tinder girl, but you know. It was a massive self-esteem boost for the time being. In the months since then I\\'ve carried myself better and felt more of an inbuilt self confidence. I\\'d even say that I was edging towards socialising, going out, and maybe even going out drinking and stuff - experiencing things I never did growing up, because now I felt decent enough to do so. Well I *did* feel decent, anyway. Anyway, today, I passed a random schoolgirl who was with what I assume to be her boyfriend. For some reason I felt intimidating without even making eye contact with them so I got out my phone. I looked down, and I was texting on my phone - minding my business. Then, after I passed them she turned around and said \"you\\'ve got a big nose\". Dear god. I felt like I was in high school again, and I\\'m now 22.

I\\'ve only really had one or two comments on it in about four years, so I thought I was finally past that point of it being an issue - but evidently not. After all, I received a comment completely unprovoked from a total stranger. A total stranger looked at me for all of 4 seconds and immediately found a flaw with me, and it has made me feel completely awful. Moments like this just make me feel completely undesirable, and add further damage to my already-low self esteem.

She listened and was pretty understanding but I didn\\'t drag it on too long. Since then we didn\\'t speak until a few months a go when I messaged her out of the blue one night. She was cool about it and we had some fun in our dialogue. She said she was cool with being friends now since we weren\\'t in high school. Our dialogue is pretty short most of the time, as casual conversation doesn\\'t get far. When intoxicated, I\\'ve opened up to her and she has been pretty understanding and supportive of me. She\\'s even encouraged me to talk to her more.

Last night we talked briefly and she mentioned that the responsibilities she had were ending soon and specified that she would have more free time.

She seems interested but since I am bad at reading into things I am here to get more input. She is a very nice and caring person, and I believe her when she says she cares about me. When I decided to quit Facebook last week over an emotional fit she gave me her number without asking and told me to message her whenever, if I needed something, and made me promise to keep in touch. Though when I message or text her she isn\\'t always responsive. To be fair though, my social anxiety makes me have unrealistic standards of that and I hypothesize rejection before anything actually happens. She is nice though and seems willing to listen to my problems, but in that respect it makes me feel like she wants to be my therapist instead of my friend. In my experience, anything short of a \"yes\" tends to mean \"no\", and she is the kind of person who is too nice and considerate to give a straight \"no\" answer. Regardless, she does seem to want to keep in contact and cares about me. So I am perplexed about which way the winds are blowing in this situation.

I don\\'t play video games either so all my social interaction basically just happens at work. I have a few \"work friends\" but you know. Anyway one of my coworkers yesterday just asked me on a whim if I was interested in going out to the Strip that night. It was going to be him, his girlfriend and her friend (all three of them are Hispanic and I don\\'t know if this matters but my friend said the other girl is 18 and originally from Mexico and I don\\'t know why but that is fuckin hot lmao). Anyway he said he thought he\\'d ask me since I\\'ve expressed interest in latinas and she was going to be kind of a third wheel. So I said fuck it I\\'ll think about it and text you after work (not disclosing that a wailing fucking pit of fear just opened in my stomach). Later on he texts me saying the plan is just to chill and walk the strip since this other girl is visiting from SoCal and just wants to see the city at night. At this point I\\'ve just been scanning the SA subreddit for situations similar to mine, frantically clicking from post to post while the adrenaline surges through my veins like fucking hot lava. I tell myself I just have to fuckin do it. The worst that can happen is I\\'m a little awkward or whatever.. I\\'ll actually feel WORSE if I just completely bail out and sit around at home in my thoughts. I ask him if I should just drive down there and park and meet them somewhere and he\\'s like yeah that works. Around 7 I get ready to go. My hands are shaking as I put my contacts in. My clean shirt I put on is already sweaty so I swap it for another. After choking down on a miserable, undercooked hot dog I get into my car and put on some tunes. Alright now for the good (terrible) part... The thing is like I live in Vegas but I can\\'t even remember the last time I\\'ve been downtown, let alone the Strip. So I decide to avoid the freeways and I\\'m heading down the street doing a straight shot for the Strip. I\\'m feeling a little better; I got my music playing and I\\'m on google maps looking for a parking lot downtown. Turns out there\\'s free parking down between the Tropicana and Hooters casino. All of a sudden, as I\\'m barreling onward towards certain doom, my anxiety gives me a big ol\\' bitch slap. There\\'s *so many people* down here. Groups of three, four, good lord.. *five* just out, enjoying the evening I guess. As I\\'m approaching the Strip I notice all of the obvious tourists walking around, and I realize they must be feeling similar to how I am right now. I feel like I\\'m discovering the world for the first time. So many tall buildings.. Crowds of people using the crosswalks.. Big signs with flashing images of famous, successful entertainers.. I\\'m wrapped up in my head. This is too much to handle all at once. I find the spot where I\\'m going to park and miss the turn so I\\'ve got to go down and take the next right. My anxiety is bubbling up inside of me. The pot\\'s boiling and I feel it\\'s going to spill over. My hands stick to the wheel as I inconspicuously make the turn into the lot. \"If I don\\'t do this my friend is going to tell everyone at work I bailed out. Plus, this girl is expecting me to be there...\" \"Shit. I\\'m a loser.. and these girls are probably really social. I\\'m going to kill the vibe. I know it... What the fuck.\" I park my car. I feel as if I could vomit. It wasn\\'t the undercooked hot dog; it\\'s the anxiety. I\\'m regrettably familiar with panic and its distinct nausea. I\\'m sitting there, breathing deeply to try and cool the racing thoughts, staring out my window. My stomach bubbling. My thoughts still racing. I feel a fart coming (let\\'s all hang our heads in silence for this fateful moment). I guess I\\'m ready to go. I just have to do this. Let\\'s fucking do this.

Now, I know this story might seem anticlimactic. But let me tell you that in that moment my heart stopped, and then sank to an unfathomably low place. I looked outside, and I watched the cars going by, and the flashing lights, and heard music playing from a club or a bar somewhere. I didn\\'t even bother texting my friend. I kind of curled up so my ass was not directly below me, moved my seat back a little and scooted forward, igniting the engine while the smell of shit confirmed that was just happened really, actually happened. And that\\'s basically it. The drive home was horrible. After I cleaned up I texted my friend and pretty much just told him sorry and that something came up (although \"came down\" might be a more fitting description). I don\\'t work with him again until Monday but I probably won\\'t tell him what really happened. I had to share it with somebody though lol. It sucked but I felt kind of relieved (both mentally and in my bowels). I ended up making another hot dog but I cooked it thoroughly this time and I enjoyed the fuck out of it.

However, damn near every last one of my friends dumped me on my ass when we split. We had a pretty tight-knit group of mutual friends. They refused to hear my side of the story when we separated. They only reached out to criticize me and shame me for “all the hurt I’ve caused” when they didn’t know a single ounce of the shit I was going through in our marriage. Not once did they reach out and see how I was doing. They’ve said we can sit down and “talk it out”, but I’m not sure. They’ve made themselves out to be victims as a result of my failed marriage and I can’t wrap my head around it. And even if we patch things up I am never going to get past knowing how silent they stayed while I was struggling through all of this. The only thing now, is, I now have hardly any friends. My one good friend I have left lives eight hours away. I haven’t seen her for months, obviously. I don’t know how to just make new friends. I feel so alone. I don’t miss my marriage, but I miss having people to do things with, that at one time I thought I could count on. The only people that reach out to me anymore are thirsty ex-boyfriends “just checking up on me” after everything. I don’t know how to reach out and connect with other people. I’ve always been the person that would be the last to be invited to stuff, if I was invited at all. Sorry for the rambling, I’m just not in a great place mentally. I get up, go to work, come home and sleep. And repeat. Soon I start classes again, so I’ll get to add that to the mix as well. But I have no social life anymore and I miss it. God, I miss it so much.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'Social Event Review - Dinner with 5 - went terribly. **Diagnosis**: I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder in 2012 but I guess you could say I have had problems with social situations my entire life. **Treatments**: I have had CBT on and off these six years and try and follow the self help guides when I am not in sessions. I know it\\'s going to take a long time to see any progress, to rewrite my thought processes and I haven\\'t given up yet. However, recently, things have been getting worse and I\\'m starting to forget what it\\'s like to have a successful social situation. In terms of medication I have been prescribed Fluoxetine, Setraline and paroxetine. None have made any difference to how I think, act or behave in social situations. **Event**: As part of my therapy, I am encouraged to engage in social situations and so when this opportunity (an evening out with four old flatmates) came up I took it. Which I suppose in itself is some small victory. I tried to enact techniques from my therapy such as, if you can\\'t think of anything to say then ask a question, the problem was that as soon as I asked anyone a question (how\\'s the gf, have you finished your masters etc.?) they would give a one word answer and immediately turn back to the \"funny banter\" of the group. I honestly could not think of a thing to say to add to these funny anecdotes, my brain was whizzing at break neck speed but for some reason, like always, nothing would come to me. It is honestly fascinating to me how things seem to automatically come to people, line after line spilling out of them effortlessly. My mind turns into a blank slate. When everyone except one person went to the loo I tried to talk the remaining guy but he gave a one word answer, yawned and then pulled out his phone. I couldn\\'t really think of something truly genuine and engaging to say chit chat wise like everyone else. When everyone returned he quickly shoved his phone back in his pocket and became energetic again. It is honestly shocking how boring I am. All the while I am starting to burn up inside and get that anxious sick feeling. Overall apart from my run of the mill questions I have added nothing to the dialogue of the group for the entire night. Someone draws attention to my silence by asking if there is something wrong with me as I haven\\'t spoken. When we leave everyone is given an emotional farewell except me who is given a curt bye. Understandable as I contributed nothing to the fun of the night. When I get home I try and use my CBT to \"post process\" the situation i.e. he was yawning because he was tired not because I was boring him, he was looking at his phone because he had received an important text, they gave a curt goodbye to me because they were deep in conversation etc. I still feel sick to my stomach though. I\\'m not even sure why I wrote this, I suppose as a distraction from doing something drastic because I want the anxiety to end. I truly despise myself because my performance in social situations has destroyed every aspect of my life (family, friends, relationships, employment, hell even shopping brings me anxiety). This event is simply another to add to the pile of events (which is every social event) that has gone wrong. Keep going to these things my therapist says; things will get better. I smile when he says this but I know it will be easier to will blood from a stone.\\')', 'labels': ['not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect', 'related to an outdoor space with negative effect'], 'scores': [0.8424718379974365, 0.06264808028936386, 0.053493719547986984, 0.04138632491230965]}\n",

            "{'sequence': \"('Why is it so difficult to say Hello?. Serious question. There are plenty of options but none fit me. “Hi”, “Hiya” and “Hey” are too camp. “Alright” is too closed. “Safe” or “Wag-warn” are long gone, maybe on Facebook. There’s “Yo” but I’m also a 25-year-old English teacher. Plus, does anyone actually say “Hello” apart from Adele? Then what's left? As a result, I normally say something cringy I instantly regret, say one of the above in a stupid accent or say the French or Spanish, this only adds to the dread of social situations. Even if there were a simple word that didn’t sound strange, I'm also terrified of talking to people in general. If I spot someone I know in public, the first thing I do is try to avoid them. Why make a fool of yourself if you can just avoid the situation altogether? For people I don't know very well, it's a winner; it avoids awkwardness and small talk. The problem arises however when I come across a family member or a good friend, somehow who I would genuinely enjoy talking to, but I just can't get past that first hurdle.  and#x200B; ### Meeting my best friend Recently, one of my best friends walked onto my bus, instead of shouting something offensive at him or taking the piss out of his clothes and getting him to sit next to me; my automatic reaction was to duck my head and avoid him. Thankfully, he went and sat upstairs. Once the bus approached the city-centre, I stood up and walked to the front of the bus in anticipation of a big queue of people, it paid off as the queue must have blocked his view of me from behind. I jumped off the bus quickly and walked off before I heard a shout from behind. The shame I felt afterwards was immense. ### Meeting my brother On another occasion, I spotted my older brother in the same bar as me in town and I was too afraid to let him know I was there. At the time, I thought *So I shout his name, he comes over, then what?* *I just saw him a few hours ago at home, what the fuck would we talk about anyway?*  and#x200B; ### Kissing people *After the awkward “alreet”, if it's a girl, it’s time for hugs and kisses. It’s not the physical contact nor the proximity which causes the issue, it’s the confusion. Do I have to give them 1 kiss on the cheek, or is that just for my Nan when she's ill? Do I give 2 kisses, or is that forward? Do my lips actually need to touch their cheek or do I just pretend?* ### Hugging people *Hugs can be fatal; flailing arms can end up in all sorts of places. Also, once embracing, do you hold the hug momentarily or let go straightaway? Do I rub their back or is that the weirdest thing I've ever heard? What if we go the same side and our heads clash?*  and#x200B; ### Ice-makers Finally, there's the pressure to make conversation. In social situations, I can often be loud and occasionally I like to be the centre of attention; talking to the group as a whole is not the issue. However, speaking with someone 1 to 1 can be a catastrophe; I'm awkward, weird, really *really* nice or painfully boring. Even if I've known you for years or we´re best mates, my favourite conversation starters include: *How's the job going? What are you drinking? How old are you now? Is your birthday still the 13th of September? Yep? Sound. Have a good night mate.*  and#x200B; Just to remind you, I apologise in advance.

He could even help me pay. I got pissed at this kind of offer and was done with him at this very moment and became even more sensitive to this. He then became terribly clingy and when I denied him he started showing a not-so-cool and clingy version of him. But this was months ago, I tried to kind of continue with life. Still, everytime I smile I remember this. Or even before, so I try to keep my mouth shut. But these constant reminders, even if I want to forget and focus in other things.

Last time I could smile without feeling bad about it was when I was a child, and the thought of it is quite hard to handle. I will however see another ortodontologist.

I just never came along with most of the people in my class, and unfortunately I did meet other kids my age. In other words, I've been dependent on them almost my whole life.

I have spent most of my childhood and late teenage years all by myself (in my spare time). I've always had people that I got along with and people I would consider my friends, but we never hung out in the spare time. Now we have drifted away from each other, I did not get any friends in high school because I was too quiet and didn't initiate any conversations. In high school I had a couple people from middle school that I spoke to, but I could go days without saying a word.

Hi guys, I just started my second semester at uni and am really struggling with having to share a kitchen in halls to cook every evening. It's frustrating because before uni I was actually making small strides and feeling more confident generally in day-to-day situations, but this since September has made me feel as though I'm back to square one. I guess it breaks down into two problems - \\\\- I just can't physically bear the small talk and the inevitable silence that follows after a while. I just feel plain uninteresting and exposed when I have to stand there and cook with someone else and as I said, it is actually physically painful in my chest and stomach to do. This has resulted in nobody in the flat knowing me that well (although I've made some small talk) which feels really isolating. It has meant me living off pre-bought cold food, which is detrimental to both my wallet and my health. \\\\- There's one person in my flat who I've never spoken to or met properly, for some reason I just got really intimidated when I heard him outside on the first day. So I've basically hidden from him and now it would be extremely awkward if we were in the kitchen alone at the same time. This also results in me not using the kitchen or timing it when I know he goes out. Has anyone who's been in any sort of similar situations advise any tips for how to combat this and take small steps? Would medication help take the edge off (keeping in mind side effects)?

Tried but I just couldn\\'t. My mind was racing with thoughts and I wasn\\'t even conscious of them lol. Got up at around 6, got dressed, ate. Inside the bus I felt neausea so I ate something, couldn\\'t really swallow so ate very slowly. Arrived there and the lady told me I don\\'t have any classes now, only at 9:45. Went home and ate. Around 9:30 went get the bus. I felt more anxious the closer I arrived there. Entered the room, 10 min late, everyone was standing in groups. The teacher told me that everyone should introduce themselves in groups. I went to the one closest to me. They were all looking at me, waiting for me to start talking and introducing. I was out of air, out of breath but kept on an tried my best to say stuff. To focus on what to say. But it\\'s very hard when you can barely breath and your heart beats faster than it would if you were running. All the people in the group were very nice. I tried to make some small talk. After that the teacher wanted us to stand in a circle, so we would introduce again. I was so anxious. I always prefer being the first rather than the last, to get it over with. Unfortunately, I was in the middle. With each person that spoke next, I felt so much agony. Fearing of blushing, fearing of talking with my voice sounding nervous. Trying to make myself calm down. Try to focus on the external. Think positive. Nothing worked. (Not trying to make anyone feel down with this btw). So I told myself \"whatever, I carne calm myself anyways, what am I supposed to do? Maybe I\\'ll blush, my voice will shake for sure. Just go with it. There\\'s nothing I can do.\" My turn. I spoke calmly, (surprisingly - tried to tell myself to enjoy the moment) but my voice definitely was shaking lol. I may have blushed but I\\'m not sure. It\\'s a really quick feeling, feeling the heat up my head, pressure, maybe like a lava lamp lol? I also don\\'t focus on it, I focus on what I\\'m gonna say. (I did rehearse a bit but that\\'s ok I think. It made it more easy for me in that moment and I was anxious already anyways). When I started talking the professor looked quickly away. around the time I felt like blushing. She kinda laughed. Idk if it was at me but I didn\\'t care anymore. I don\\'t care if people laugh at me or judge me anymore. I still have these feelings of seeing a group of girls laugh and thinking they laugh at me but it\\'s different. I don\\'t hold onto those thoughts, and like I said, it doesn\\'t matter anymore. I don\\'t let it influence my performance anymore. The possible judgment they have about me, I can\\'t control. So why bother? After my turn I went ahead and sat down. I went to the bathroom cause I was bored of hearing all the ppl telling why they choose this class. I mean it\\'s all the same. And I guess I realized that, I romanticized socializing. It\\'s great to have ppl to bond over something but tbh I don\\'t really care about everyone. When u don\\'t know anyone, everyone is just a person. I\\'m happy to meet new people but what bothers me the most rn are the symptoms. Today there were 2 or 3 times I wanted to speak up but didn\\'t cause I was too afraid to feel anxiety. I feared the fear. If and I guess if I didn\\'t had sa I would\\'ve been so much more interactive, present, dynamic, assertive. It\\'s just so annoying. Man, I don\\'t have words to describe. It\\'s just so damn annoying to feel it and not being able to enjoy the moment. Talking about yourself, listening to others talking about themselves. Just being there and having fun.

It was so severe, at the beginning the only solution i found was for the group of people to be quite and not socialize, so none of my fears would pop up. This core branched into all sorts of other problems: depression for isolating myself at home, extreme anxiety at public places, low self esteem, paranoia directed towards relatives, lack of social tools for everyday interactions (interacting with a cashier, for example), toxic relations becasue it affected me so much to be seen alone, a strong fear developed for constantly being judged as antisocial.  and#x200B; So, how did I improve in this vortex of misery? 1. The first big step was to allow for my fear to cool off. My social interactions were catastrophic because inside my head i was feeling such intense emotions of fear and anxiety while other people where relaxed and normal, so our perspectives and behavior were completely incompatible, thus getting constantly rejected which would just enforce my fears even harder. I took time off before entering college and made a routine with less \"dangerous\" social enviroments. Just going to the gym, taking an online course (yes, still caused anxiety), therapy secessions, few friday dinners with family. At the beginning I still got a lot of anxiety and fear, but to this routine I was able to adapt and set aside my original fears because it was not nearly as socially menacing as school. 2. Its improtant to recognize how fear makes you fetishize social relations, but even more importantly, that you need to normalize social relations by confronting these fetishes, simply being conscious of them is not enough. So for example if a friend was telling a story, instead of actually paying attention to the story, my mind would wonder on social aspects like: is it an interesting story? should i laugh, are other people laughing?, would i be able to tell such story to other people?, is he telling it with good social skills? how much attention is he drawing?. Its kind of an egocentric part of social anxiety where our insecurity constantly makes us put a lot of thought process and comparisons to a social interaction, and prevents us from giving an honest and instintive response. I believe we do this out of fear of having to confront people and having the interaction as frictionless as possible, which results in forcing smiles, laughter, or interest for the other people. But this is of course not sustainable in the long run (especially if the social fear reduces as you get to know people) because your mind grows very tired of faking responses and they become more obvious for others. The solution is to find a middle point where you actually get to confront people: if they say something that is not interesting then you hold a stance and show no interest, but not in a abrupt manner because then the other person might actually react negatively. This in turn makes the other people adapt to your own tastes and thus the interaction becomes a lot more healthier as now both parties are making a social effort.  and#x200B;  and#x200B;  and#x200B;  and#x200B;\\')', 'labels': ['not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'related to an outdoor space with negative effect', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect'], 'scores': [0.7409265637397766, 0.1092657521367073, 0.07845337688922882, 0.07135428488254547]}\n",

Not even the only thing that happened today, but it had the biggest effect. Yesterday was awful too. First day of class. This group that I thought was starting to accept me last semester pretty much just outright ignored me. They barely even said hi, and didn\\'t leave me a seat with them. So okay, I sit dead back in the last row, alone. A long day too, 9 hours of class. But no, it wasn\\'t enough that I\\'m the only person in a class of 50 people that\\'s completely alone and that hasn\\'t been able to befriend a single person in 4 years (6 years if you count the other college I dropped out from). It really had to be rubbed in my face. First class was bad enough. \"Make your own groups\" bullshit etc. etc. My heartbeat spiked like I was running a marathon and I felt like my head was gonna explode. It was so fucking humiliating to be the only person without a group/partner. Not only that, but even the fucking professor forgot about me. So I thought ok whatever fuck off, I\\'m just not gonna do it (it\\'s 10% of the grade, which is a lot, but whatever), but the girl that was writing the groups for him saw me (who happened to be one of the people in the group that I thought was accepting me lmao) and she said something and the room went silent and awkward until someone took pity and said I can work with them. Okay, finally over. I attempt to relax a bit, but 20 minutes later the next class starts (same professor). And he announces the same fucking shit, another group project for that class. But the groups can\\'t be the same because there\\'s less projects in this one or something. So again, I go through the same process, I stress myself out etc. Then at the same time that girl from the group that I was trying to fit in with, and another one from another group (that\\'s in weird/bad relations with that first one) tell me I can work with them out of pity. Literally at the same time. So of course I have to fucking pick between the two and whoever I pick the other one will be offended. So I just say \"well, I\\'ll see by the end\", but then when the turn came for the group which accepted to work with me the first time, also named me to be in this group too. Okay, fine. Finally over, right? 2 hours later, (different class, different professor) same fucking shit. But this time no one even offered. The two girls that I was afraid one of them will get offended if I pick the other one? Turns out both of them were probably offended because I picked the third group (not that I had much say in the matter). So no one offered anything by the end, including that group which accepted me for the other two projects (because these groups had to be smaller). So ok, here we go again. I go through the same stress etc. until at the end I get put into a random group (where I\\'ll be expected to do all the work). But yeah beggars can\\'t be choosers Also because I always waited until the end, I have 3 projects do to at the worst possible date, around the finals. So that\\'s gonna be fucking great.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'Some general tips, which can be helpful. Hey guys, It\\'s been a while, since I posted last time here. I\\'ve known consciously about my anxiety for over a year now and I\\'ve done some things in regards to it. So yeah, here are four tips, that have helped me so far: - Most of your anxious thoughts are over exaggerations. Understand that. This alone deserves a separate post if you ask me. When we have anxious thoughts, we tend to over exaggerate things. We think that by making one mistake at work, we\\'ll probably get fired or think that if someone speaks to us in a more pissed off tone, then they probably hate all of our being. We even might have thoughts about our own anxiety. \"What if I have the worst case of anxiety? What if I become bipolar or schizophrenic? What if my life has been already messed up and it\\'s too late for me?\" This tip is the easiest one, since you probably know all of this already without me telling you this. But a little reminder of this is good, since it leads us to: - Start questioning these exaggerated thoughts. So let\\'s say you\\'re a guy in your 20\\'s. Your confidence is shit and you suck at dating. So, you have a thought of downloading Tinder in hopes that you\\'ll score with some girls. And then the thoughts start flooding in: What if I\\'m ugly? What if I use a filter to make myself look more handsome but if I meet a girl irl, she\\'ll see how ugly I am and run away? What if the girls perceive me as a creep? What if I match up with a girl, see her irl, but be boring as fuck and she sees that?What if I don\\'t match with any girls? There Sir. You got yourself a situation here. So, what do you do? You start off by asking questions to yourself. Am I truly ugly? Before saying: yes I am, think about it. There are people, who are truly ugly, but still score in the dating world, have friends and have people, who care about them. What\\'s so scary of being ugly? I\\'m sure that you\\'re not that ugly as you think you are, since this is an over exaggerated thought. But even if you are, what of it? Will you die? No. Will some people like you? Yes. Will some people not like you? Yes. Guess what? Even beautiful people are like that! They too have people, who like them or don\\'t like them. But what if people avoided you because of your ugliness? Is that true tho? I personally avoid people, who have ugly personalities, not ugly faces, wbu? Have you ever heard a sentence like: \"that dude is so ugly, please don\\'t invite him over\"? I personally haven\\'t. But I\\'ve heard sentences about people having ugly personalities for which they are avoided. But anyways, you get the point. Or at least I hope so. Start challenging these thoughts. The more you do it, the little these types of thoughts will have power over you. The issue that many people have is that they give ears to these thoughts as tho they were spoken by God himself. Why? Where are the proofs for these thoughts? If there isn\\'t any proofs, than what on Earth are you doing following them? - Dive into feared situations. Oh boy. This oven gets hotter by the second. This one was and still is one of the most hard tips to follow. It\\'s okay when I write about this, while I\\'m in a calm situation, but what am I gonna do, if I\\'m in a feared situation? In my case, I start panicking and praying to some deity of inner peace to make me chill as fuck. But as you already know, that doesn\\'t work. The more self-conscious you are, the more freaked out you are and the more freaked out you are, the more these exaggerating thoughts that your ugly or that people will think poorly of you start to surface. So what do you do? Whatever you do, don\\'t run. Running will only re-enable the fear you have of the situations. Try to be calm as you can possibly can. If your feared situations involves other people, you\\'ll probably get one of two reactions: hey, are you okay man? You seem a little pale faced, do you want me to get something for you to eat or drink OR okay, this guy is acting a bit weird, but whatever, it\\'s his business (inner monologue in the person\\'s head). This notion that everyone will hate us or have ill thoughts about us is not rational and is again over exaggeration. When your fight or flight is activated, you probably will not be able to start questioning these thoughts because of all the fear and panic you have and the fact that you are maybe in a public place and cannot just talk to yourself like a crazy person. But when your brain calms down, try to question the thoughts so that you\\'ll become more independent of them. That way, the next time you find yourself in the tight spot, your brain will be more prepared until you eventually overcome the feared situation fully and own it like a boss. - Make positive confessions to yourself by yourself. For us, who\\'ve experienced anxiety, just the thought of making positive confessions makes us cringe, but bare with me. Here I\\'m not talking about situations where you say: I\\'m skinny, but in reality: you\\'re fat. You get the point. Here I\\'m talking about embracing all of those good qualities you have within yourself and embrace them. All of us have those things. There were many situations in your life, where you didn\\'t just do a nice thing, but a great thing. Maybe you\\'ve helped a buddy out with some money or advise. Maybe you saved someone\\'s life. Maybe you have good social skills despite being socially anxious. Whatever it is. Embrace it. Repeat it. Let it become a mantra or a prayer to you. Whatever we believe about ourselves determines how we will act in different situations. If you have the belief that you are a shitty person full of only bad luck, that will be your life. If you embrace however all of your flaws, try to change them and have positive beliefs about yourself, that will be your life. Most of these tips to some degree are rooted in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT). However read this with caution. I\\'m not some prophet or even a professional and I could be terribly wrong somewhere down the road. It\\'s best to do your own research or even consult a professional, since you\\'ll get the best feedback there is.

            "{'sequence': \"('Social anxiety and my first crush. Hi all, Brand new to Reddit but a long time lurker. I've decided to try and take some action over an ongoing situation that's stretched out these past few weeks, and maybe you guys might be able to help me? From what I gather, the people here seem decent and some of the advice I've seen dished out over the years is excellent, so I might as well give it a go. Just to start off with, I'll give you some basic information on what's up. I'm 20, a shiny new uni student in her first year, first semester and living with some pretty intense social anxiety and depression that's been ongoing since I was about 11. My teenage years were chaotic and everything that could've gone wrong went wrong. I'd just moved schools, had no friends because I was way too shy and depressed, I watched a relative die slowly from cancer, I'd made up my mind that I wouldn't live past 18, starved myself, the whole works. I had zero self esteem and couldn't relate to anyone, and at the time, those years were the worst years of my life up until two years ago when my anxiety reached it's peak. I'd dropped out of uni because it had gotten to a point when I no longer gave a fuck about anything, or so I thought. Turns out my anxiety had manifested into panic disorder, and I'm talking agoraphobia, fear of being harmed or killed by strangers, panic attacks from the moment I woke up until I managed to finally put myself to sleep. Pure unbridled fear, and I lost a shit ton of weight too because I physically couldn't bring myself to eat. It was so bad I lived in constant fear of going insane and ending up in a madhouse, had an intense fear of meds and was convinced I'd kill myself, whether accidentally or not. Last year I somehow managed to pull myself out of the shit, drug free and without any outside help, aside from my best friend and my Mum. (Please don't do this, get help) I studied and worked the hardest I've ever worked to get back to uni (because I failed so many units last time, it was hard slog), and having achieved what should've been an impossible task through the most perseverance I'd had in years, I got back into my dream school, studying what I really love and got accepted to live at a residential college that's super hard to get into because it's so popular. The first two months of uni I was happier than I'd ever been. Talking to people, going to classes, trying new things, I'd never felt so confident. But out of everything I did, talking to this boy was one of the best things I ever did. This was day one, ONE hour into my uni journey. I sit down at this table as it fills up and I'm chatting away with almost every one. I couldn't believe how well I was doing. This guy sits next to me and eats his dinner, not saying a word. An hour later, every one eventually finishes and leaves and it's just me and this guy. Just as I'm sitting there wondering if it'd be strange to say hello so late, he reaches out his hand and introduces himself to me. I laugh and tell him I was just stewing over whether or not to say hi and we immediately hit it off. He's kind of quiet, but well spoken, and everything we talk about just seems to come naturally. An hour later, we exchange details and I'm overjoyed. Finally, a nice cruisey guy I can make buds with! Or so I thought. Flash forward seven weeks and I have a massive crush on this guy. The first few weeks it was all kosher, he invites me around campus to do stuff, I invite him in return, and even though we don't see each other very often (two very different majors), he's unbelievably easy to talk to and just a really nice guy. Then I realise I have a crush on him. At first I thought it was anxiety, because I've never had a crush before. But man. This is a crush. Every time I see him it's like a gut punch, and I feel so winded. It's not just the fact that he's mega cute, but his personality is absolutely amazing. We also share a lot of common interests so we have heaps to talk about, which definitely helps in the developing-a-crush-department. I really like this dude, but I'm so lost. I feel like we're friends but at the same time I don't really know him at all. We've talked for hours over several occasions but seven weeks isn't nearly enough time to get to know someone right? So how am I already crushing on this guy so hard? The thing is that it's hard to say if it's one sided, but maybe it's because of how badly I want to pursue this, despite how scared shitless I am, and that I really want it to work out. He's not much of a texter and rarely gets back to me when we text, (but considering his major, completely understandable). He's not inviting me places at the moment and sometimes I wonder if he's trying to create some distance between us. The thing is when we do catch up and talk, it's super comfortable and natural and I don't feel unwelcome at all. The other day we spent 2 and a half hours talking after lunch, then at dinner (we'd both well and truly finished before I approached him, by the way) another 1 and a half, and even then as we walked out of the dining hall he encouraged me to continue. The overarching issue is that while my first few weeks here were spent on an immeasurable high, the past 3 weeks I've seen some pretty low lows. I've become super self conscious and next to had a nervous break down. As a result, I isolated myself from my friends and stopped saying hi to people, and he was one of them, because I didn't want to burden him. It has nothing to do with other people, but often when I feel like this I have this idea in my head that I annoy people, and I worry constantly about annoying him, even though I find it hard to imagine him getting annoyed at anyone. Even though I know for a fact this guy is single, I feel like I'm not good enough and annoying and being too pushy. I'm dropping so many hints, so surely he'd get them by now, right? But then again, dropping hints is so medicore and I can't expect something to be obvious to him because its obvious to me. But then again, maybe he's just not interested and too polite to say so. I have no idea. The thing is that I think he's like me, especially with things he's said before. He's the quiet type, and sometimes I wonder if he worries about the same things I do too. But he also rarely ever says hi to me, even when he passes me directly on the way to class (and I know for a fact he sees me), but maybe I've brought this on myself during those two weeks where I retreated back into my shell. He takes up so much space in my head and I wonder sometimes if this is just anxiety running it's course. I doubt I take up any space in his, but I am a chronic overthinker, and this has bothered me for weeks. He told me he's only staying here a year before moving out and now I feel like I need to say something at least once or l'll regret it. But I don't have a lot of self confidence and I honestly believe he's way out of my league. Is it really fair that I expect him to date someone with a history like mine, especially with all my personal problems? I don't want to pass that onto him. It sucks ass, and I like him too much to want to ever do that. As it stands, I believe I have a few options. 1) Stop giving a fuck and obsessing over this (aka, live in the moment) and focus on building our friendship before anything else (I like this one and am already pursuing this one, but yet again, am I being too pushy?) 2) Let it go, even knowing he's single, and regret it for the next few years or possibly forever. He also has Tindr, so should I swipe right? We live so close together though, and if this goes pear shaped I don't want it to be awkward between us. This is long as shit but I need some serious help. I've talked to my Mum and friends about this but sometimes an outside perspective can really help with these kinds of things. You'd seriously make my year.

My first memory of a female is of her telling me I'm dirty and basically not equal or normal. Then my mom said the same throught growing up mainly my earlier memories as a kid. I wasted her life as I was born, that I wasn't normal, she wanted to go live her life not take care of me. Leaving out running home to see arguments/voilence and staying up till early morning with no sleep to make sure my mom was ok from the top of the stairs then going to school to get picked on by all the years, then something I can't say that my mother did that messed up my mind. I thought I handled all this not to bad, but I guess it's who I am today. I think this is why I have never really had a female friend and I get so worried by thier thoughts and so anxious. Like a puppy if you don't expose them to other puppies in a positive manner when young they are anxious and nervous when old. Today by not trying to offend anyone and sharing a genuine concern I think I came across in the wrong way. So I added something to make it seem less that wasn't true to try and make them feel not so awkward. Though they said they did understand, something they said resonated with me and I keep going over it and I can't forget what they said, I felt like my earlier memories again (bieng singled out) this may not be the case but I just feel humiliation and like I would be doing a favour not existing, the sad thing is how much i care about others happiness still. I just feel like the only way to solve it is to tell them I would disappear of earth. I don't understand why and of course I don't want too and I dont think I would. But I just feel it would make up for my introduction to earth. I feel like knowing I'm gone would bring happiness and relief to not see me anymore to people. It's just I have nothing, no one and my legacy (the way people remember/think of me) is all I have when I gone. If by being me and trying to be nice to everyone leaves me. As the guy who is weird when I haven't tried to hurt anyone's feelings. It's just once again predetermined that I will go through such pain, when all I have is care. At this point I don't really know how to feel. I just know in reality though no matter what I do I'm not good enough and I will not be that guy, instead the odd one out. I just feel I'm struggling. I feel like every female hates me or thinks I'm shouldnt be here. Sorry for rant, just upsetting that this was out of my control as a kid then no matter what I do now as I have no social skills and I'm akward I remain that person people helped put down and ridicule and I don't understand the way out. If I could go back now and have a life I would be so thankful. I have been feeling this for a while but I remain happy. Its just hard to take this when i am already having a hard time.

I deleted Facebook years ago, and decided this year to delete Instagram and Snapchat believing it would help my self esteem (in regards to my appearance at least), and it definitely has, but it’s also enabled me to completely shut off from online social contact. I now struggle with posting and commenting anywhere, even anonymously, and when I do post I’ll usually end up going back and deleting it months later or ghosting an interaction I was having.

It doesn\\'t go up all the way but people start entering the store. I pocket my phone and follow the crowd, ducking under the partially-opened shutters. I\\'m near the end of the store about to go out into the open mall when a woman starts yelling \"excuse me\" from somewhere behind me. Now I\\'ve developed this (bad) habit of ignoring strangers that call out in public because idk, it\\'s never my attention they\\'re trying to get and social anxiety makes me feel like an idiot when I turn around only to see them signalling for someone else.

I\\'m literally 3 steps from getting out of the store and into the mall but instead I turn around and start walking back to the shutters. As I near the woman to pass her she loudly says, \"I\\'m calling out for him and he\\'s just ignoring me and walking like he owns the place\", then sucks her teeth. I don\\'t say a word. I just ducked back under the shutters and walked around to the main entrance like I should\\'ve from the start. Thankfully I got my bank work done without many problems and left.

I’ve never been officially diagnosed but I know for sure what it is and I’ve never reached out for help. Recently however it’s gotten so bad I can’t do anything but to lay in bed and think about the same thing over and over.. I can’t even get to work. The thing that’s bothering me so much is a social even I attended last weekend. It was a small group of me and about 6 other people. We took a roadtrip down to my best friend’s girlfriend’s summer house and brought a lot of alcohol. It was fine the whole evening, although quite disappointing because two of the people we invited (a couple) were so incredibly boring to be around, and everyone was a couple except me, a girl Ive never met before and my best friend’s girlfriend’s sister. I socialized with everyone pretty much (I don have problems socializing at all, im actually pretty extroverted most of the time) but the only people that were really talking to me were my best friend and my best friend’s girlfriends sister (let’s call her M). It got late and everyone was pretty drunk, although my best friend was probably the most intoxicated. We were heading inside to play some old quiz game on the PS2. We were all in the living room where there was a big corner sofa and an unmade bed. I was laying in the bed that was right next to the sofa and M was next to me but sitting in the sofa (sofa and bed was really close to each other) and me and her were talking, just waiting for the others to set up the game. I didnt think too much of it but she was getting closer with half her body on the sofa and the other half in my bed. It didn’t look weird though, it wasn’t close to being inappropriate IMO. That’s when my best friend says something in the lines of ”Stop hitting on my GF sister it’s f***n disgusting”, couldnt tell if he said it jokingly but regardless he said it in front of everyone. From my perspective I hadn’t hit on her at all that night nor did I have thoughts about doing it even though she’s really attractive. I was just enjoying that somebody was talking to me without me having to put 100% of the effort. And being me, caring so much about what people think of me, turn super embarassed immediately. I go mute until I eventually tell everyone I’m going to bed. I go upstairs and just fiddle with my phone, with thoughts racing in my mind constantly. Eventually M comes upstairs and asks why I’m on my phone when I told everyone I’m gonna sleep. Although I was hesitating I told her my reaction to what my best friend said in front of everybody, how I care a lot about what people think of me and how it made me feel like everyone had this picture of me, that I was hitting on her and I didnt wanna be seen as that guy. She tells me it’s not like that but she thinks I’m attractive and has wanted to kiss me and stuff, and has told her sister and a friend she has a thing for me. Obviously I’d never do that since it’s my best friend’s girlfriend’s sister. It’s wrong in my opinion and I wouldn’t purposely hit on her. After our little talk my best friend comes up and we go outside to about everything in private. He apologized about what he said, he said he was joking but I don’t know, he also said that Im overthinking and nobody really cares. We eventually go inside to everybody and it’s just a super weird. Nobody’s talking and everybody knows why I left. What’s worse is that we still had another day to stay there, but the next day wasn’t that bad apart from the hangover. On our way back we actually had a pretty good time, probably the highlight of this trip. But it was my best friend driving and M in the back. We took a different car and didn’t drive back with the boring couple. I’m glad I’m on good terms with M atleast. Now after this whole incident my anxiety has gotten really bad. And it’s really only because I think my best friend’s girlfriend really doesn’t like me no more. We meet occasionally and I feel it will be weird, because she probably knows every single detail that I’ve said and all. And I have a feeling she feels she shouldnt have invited me there after I made things weird. It’s super embarassing and it makes me feel so insecure if I’ll meet her again.

And these crushes are essentially obsessions since I don’t even know them at all really and will just stalk on social media obsessively and then have all of these hypotheticals and what not in my head like I’m talking to them and sometimes dreams and it’s just the creepiest thing ever and I always try to get myself to stop but I can never find a way.

BUT it gets even worse. WE MET IN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FALL SEMESTER and maybe snapchatted for a few weeks, and then I saw him like once in person at a party a month later and didn’t say anything, but over the course of that semester I cried drunk and sober about it like 10 times because I don’t know why I’m holding myself back but I JUST COULDNT talk to him without being super stressed and anxious and uncomfortable that I don’t want to at all. And ok then it’s the end of the winter semester SO LITERALLY APRIL and I’m still obsessed but probably not as much but still I haven’t met anyone else New the entire year who I’ve become obsessed with over him.

And then i said when I remembered meeting me and he didn’t exactly remember the time I met him but obviously knew who I was still, and then I’m the one who didn’t respond to him after that when he asked what I was doing this summer because I just can’t.

As a kid who was absolutely terrified of of other people and their social expectations, I sort of built a wall inside my head where I was safe against the outside world. In a way this was a good thing, as it made me emotionally stoic, very independent, and uncaring of what people think of me--BUT it also left me with a deep aversion to emotional intimacy, to letting people inside those walls, even (especially!) with the people closest to me. I can\\'t remember the last time I told anyone I love them. I can\\'t talk to friends about so many things lest I let slip the fact that I actually have feelings.

I´m sorry if some things don’t add up or make no sense to you, it was after all a dream.: \"Somewhere in Berlin or Munich I was in a Rewe (convenient store). My Bike was outside and as I was buying some Snickers, Pickup (sort of cookies) and some banana-juice a beautiful and cute Girl came to me and asked me if I could buy her something since she had vergotten her purse at home or something. A little hesitant at first, I said yes. She wanted some ham. J must have been in that store for a while looking for stuff I could need on my own and then I remembered the Girl that wanted the ham. Meanwhile she had gone outside waiting. So, I went outside too to ask her what kind and how much ham she wanted. At the entrance of the store were some huge packaged pieces of ham but she didn´t seem to want the ham anymore or she wasn´t sure anymore. Next, we both walked a bit through the streets, me pushing my bike alongside, until we stopped at her apartment. It was the first floor and there was a shoe rack in the entrance. I placed my shoes there and went further inside. I felt really cosy in that apartment. she seemed very sleepy and wanted to go to bed. She asked me to come with but at that moment I noticed that I hadn´t paid for the stuff from Rewe. Also, I had unpacked my bike panier at the bedside. I told her that I had to go back and pay for it. She sleepily kind of agreed. At first my plan was to go later but then I realised how odd it would seem at the store if I waited any longer. So, I said to her: \"why don’t I just go now to get it off my mind. She didn´t like this idea and had meanwhile crawled under the blanket and also had snuggled up on some stuff of mine. I gently lifted the blanket to get all the Products from Rewe I hadn´t paid for. The Pickup-bars were nearly opened. I packed everything back in my panier paying special attention to not put the six-pack of juice on top of everything. I think she had my jacket or something that belonged to me. I put my shoes back on and wanted to walk back to the store. I even told her that I was going to walk because it was only 200m in my memory and she looked a bit confused. So, I started walking noticed that I forgot the directions and that it was further away than I first thought. So, I wanted to look for the nearest Rewe on google maps but first I wanted to go get my bike. So, I walked back and the way I found a bike that looked kind of like mine. I walked a little further but couldn´t remember anything.\" that’s when I woke up. It felt really bad that it was all just a dream.

First I went to the doctor and asked her to refer me to a psychiatrist/counselor. She said that she didn't know anyone and that I was on my own. So that was kind of a bummer because going to talk to the doctor about it was difficult enough! I ended up spending a couple months looking up a bunch of counselors online and found a lady that looked really nice. Her office was just a 5 minute walk from my house and, as I also have driving anxiety, it was perfect. I called her, told her I preferred using email and we arranged the first appointment that way. The first appointment was basically her getting to know me. How old are you? What do you do? What's your family situation like? She also made me fill out a form to determine whether or not I was suicidal or depressed...I actually think I am depressed, but none of the questions on the form applied to my symptoms. But anyway. After a few sessions I was more comfortable telling her things. I found it difficult to express what I was feeling on the spot, so I would write a list of things that I wanted to talk about/express a few days before. That really helped. I went away a few months ago and stopped seeing her after that. The sessions were very expensive and I felt like I could use the tools that she taught me and work on my anxiety on my own. I do think talking to her helped initially and I would recommend it to you. Even just going through the process of searching for and calling a counselor will be beneficial to you.

Dad died from cancer when I was 11 and my mom was always ill-tempered but my dad's passing made her a dark cloud who would still be happy once in a while, then it sort of got better after half a year but then as I grew older I realized more and more that this was never really an ordinary harmonic family I had. Dad was an oddball in his time, and I still remember him well from my childhood before cancer as he was caring enough but also emotionally awkward and cut off and occasionally childish. I have to be blunt, I think he was autistic to some extent due to his behavioral patterns which always confused me. Mom was so happy whenever she's not completely angry but I grew to find out after dad's passing how both my parents are equivalent to the oddball or socially inept people from school. Mom was outgoing but she was gullible and completely stupid all this time, but the older I've grown the more I feel she's been emotionally abusive. She knows she has shortcomings and of course she also lost her husband but she's used me and my sisters to cope with her struggle in very toxic ways. Right now I'm in a state of reflection, having just lived on my own for half a year now. I'm a complete trainwreck. Before moving home 5 years ago after a year in a kind of school outside my home I had fixed a lot of my personal issues and really grown as a person, but she undid that in just 3 years. She has learned me to succumb to torment instead of repelling it, to accept when people are unfair to you, not ever make light of other people, no sarcasm, to justify your own vehement outbursts but it's not okay for people to be angry back -- she has ruined me emotionally. I have to hit the reset button basically. I lost all my friends, my interest in music, became a shut in and yet, we all act like nothing is wrong when I visit home sometimes, and we have family reunions and my big sister's life is going so well do mom is always farcically happy whenever she's around but switches into witch mode when only me and little sister are around. It's not just me though. Last time I was home, this christmas, I could see in my little sisters eyes she wasn't happy. She had that dead eye look about her. Don't get me wrong, we can still all occasionally laugh and smile and both my sisters have lives that go fine enough, but there has been a pattern: my mom wanted babies she could care for, not children, because she's just not emotionally stable and never had been despite that with my dad to give a normal life to her children. We moved to a foreign city when I was 3 and both mom and dad decided to not want to establish a life there outside of job. Our home became our own little bubble. My mom is just so cut off from reality sometimes and she has no friends except the ones from her youth who live several 100 kilometers from her and I think it made her crazy, along with dad's passing... Or it runs in the family because all 3 of her siblings are fucking dumb and weird even more than her. And after all this hatred I still say I love my mom. I just think my social awkwardness stems from all this. She has placed restrictions on me that other normal people don't have. I can't take a joke and never respond properly to small talk or banter because my mom would cut off that kind of stuff or be angry. If you made a joke about one thing she would be offended and say something insane insinuating that your joke is inhuman and make you feel guilty about it. It all had to be sunshine and bunnies, and as a result I have to cope with everyone telling me I'm boring as a person. I can clearly remember even today how much more personable I was 5 years ago.

I too know that the only times I seem to actually socialize very well is when I don't really consider how I appear to them. I'm trying to figure out what the root of the problem is. Maybe it's that we don't understand who we are. Maybe we know who it is others see us as, but we aren't comfortable with that disconnect between 'who I appear to be' and 'who I actually am.' We don't want to disappoint their expectations. We don't want to be exposed as frauds, don't want them to really see who we actually are on the inside. Two ways to solve this is either to completely disconnect your inside and outside self like some sort of sociopathic murderer, or to unify our inside and outside self, which seems like a better solution to me. How do we do this? I think we just have to be comfortable and confident with who we are. We have to understand that not only are we valuable for our own means, but we are valuable to the whole of the human species -- exactly as we are. Maybe, then, the solution is just as simple as realizing that we are actually greatly valuable. Hopefully this helped...

You need to have something special in common with the other person. That\\'s how conversations take off in the first place--when you discover similar interests--and that\\'s how they lead to dates. Friendships are the same way, and it\\'s the reason why work friends are even a thing (the fact that you work at the same place, or do the same job, is what you have in common). With romantic relationships it seems like the more mutual interests/hobbies and similarities in personality/lifestyle there are, the more likely it is for a date to even happen in the first place. Even if these similarities aren\\'t immediately evident, one\\'s entire character is the summation of all their interests and experiences, so I think you\\'re sort of subconsciously aware of these things when you first meet someone. Without anything in common, there would be nothing to talk about on a date, and nothing to really initiate a date in the first place. So I guess what I\\'m saying is think of dates as an opportunity to learn more about the other person, that\\'s all. Your goal should be to discover who they are slowly, piece by piece, date by date, in the long process of figuring out if you belong together. On the reverse side, think of them as your opportunity to show them who you really are and be completely honest with them, so that they can also piece together the puzzle and begin to paint a clear picture of who you are. The jist of it is: be yourself. If it\\'s a date, and not a hookup, then the intentions of both parties should be of a romantic/intimate/personal nature more than a sexual one, and to me it seems like this only works if both parties are honest. That\\'s why, if I ever somehow end up getting a date, I\\'m going to try avoiding asking anyone for advice or reading clickbaity articles like \"how to make a good impression on the first date\" and stuff like that (though I probably will anyway) because if I followed that advice I wouldn\\'t be presenting myself honestly. I\\'d much rather be awkward with the other person, or at least try not to be awkward but fail, and have her understand and appreciate this, instead of coming off as a sociable, normal person and having her think that\\'s who I am, because I\\'m not, and then I\\'m just setting myself up for failure on the next date, or the next one, or anytime in the future, when she finds out. When you go on a first date with someone, there are 2 ultimate possibilities: either you end up married to them, or you don\\'t. If it\\'s the former, your true colors are going to be revealed one way or the other, so you might as well start being honest now. If it\\'s the latter, it doesn\\'t matter how you act, because you won\\'t be with them for long, so you still might as well start being honest now.

Like at a certain point, you can no longer distinguish between the effects of the meds and your own thoughts; for me, at the end of that year, it wasn\\'t \"I\\'m content with my life right now and I feel so much better because of these meds,\" it was just \"I\\'m content with my life right now and I feel so much better.\" I was so much more confident and hopeful in the future, and in my own abilities, that I kind of forgot that wasn\\'t the true me, or at least the normal me.

But put me in a group of sorts (be that a school, a work group, a meetup.com group), and I\\'ll be able to talk and have conversations quite a bit. Here\\'s how I got from empty, blank mind to \"I occasionally have some things to talk about\": I got used to the idea of being \"outside\" my mind in a conversation, if it didn\\'t involve much thinking. At first, I would focus on the other person. What are they wearing? What are their facial expressions? How does their voice sound? What impression do I get from this person? Are they friendly? Rude? Judgemental? Open minded? How do they choose their words? And just from those things you can already learn a lot about a person and, with a bit of experience, you will soon find that there are certain \"archetypes\" of human beings, that you will meet anywhere you go. Just like every school class has the jocks, the nerds, the gossipy girls with three layers of makeup, the real world also has the same archetypes of people. Sportsfans, Jokesters, the politically engaged.. Over time you will come to recognize these basic aspects in a person and will know what they likely enjoy talking about. After looking at the person, in case our conversation runs dry, I look at other outside factors. Where are we? Why are we here? What do we do here? What has this person experienced here before? How did they hear of this place? Or even really silly seeming things. How\\'s the weather? Is the bus late again? Was there a game last night? In an ideal scenario, you will mix and match things you pick up from the person with things you pick up from the environment. All depends on how the conversation is going. The important thing is to try and force yourself to focus the OUTSIDE factors. Don\\'t look at any \"inside\" factors, such as: How am I feeling? Do I look weird? What does that person think about me? etc etc etc All these things are of no importance to you, while you\\'re in the conversation. You can (and at first, probably will) be dissecting the conversations in the aftermath. That\\'s something you\\'ll also learn to stop doing. Not every faux-pas means the end of the world. I used to say a lot of stupid things, and I still say a bunch (albeit less). The main difference is that I don\\'t think much about it now. Sometimes I catch myself thinking \"ugh, i shouldn\\'t have said that\", and instead of replaying the conversation over and over in my head like I used to, I\\'ll just tell myself \"Yes, I shouldn\\'t have. Now I\\'ll know for next time.\" Learning by doing. Sorry this turned into a bit of a ramble. I hope anything in here could help you out a little bit, or give you a new thought to consider.

I hated myself for feeling and acting that way, I couldn't connect to anyone, I was on the inside of a bottle trying to read the label. A week's down the line I hit rock bottom. I was done, then it hit me. I had that dead honest conversation with myself, I faced my inner demons and pushed through the resistance, reflected deeply. I cared too much what others thought about me, I cared too much how others perceive me, I was a puppet of my own ego gratification. Under those thick layers was the younger hurted me that never got what it wanted, never got the attention and recognition that he always desired. An ongoing rage of resentment and jealousy, one could say immature emotional charge that was running my late teens. I faced that shit and let go of it. Those unmet needs from your childhood can make you run in a hamster wheel, but unless you don't Adress that, you will be run by your subconscious desires and behaviors. That was my story of my journey, that's where I started to shift my mindset and worldview. I want to help people that experience the same hell as I did and overcome this nightmare.

(i am blind without my glasses (i cannot see shit) (which gave me anxiety) The lady starts cutting my hair. I got a little nervous since I wasn\\'t able to see anything. I wanted to remind her just don\\'t cut it too short (\\'cause like then i would have to wear a hat. Although pixie cuts are suppose to be short at first so they can grow out and look really nice, but I was not confident in myself to do that.) I eventually reminded her \" just don\\'t cut my bangs too short, not above my eyebrows\" And she said \"yeah i didn\\'t cut it too short.\" When she was done, blowdryed my hair, then i finally put my glasses on to be able to see it. It was okay, it wasn\\'t perfect. I brushed my bangs to the side to get a better look/style (I didn\\'t want my bangs to just hang straight down my forehead) I also asked her if i was able to part my bangs to the left as well, (since that\\'s how pixie cuts work and all) It was able to part both sides okay. Again, the haircut wasn\\'t bad, but I still had anxiety about it, so I asked for a hand held mirror to look at it closely. The hairdresser got a mirror so I can look at my hair from the back as well. (btw the entire time she cut my hair my mom was having a conversation with her in vietnamese. *sigh* why mom? so that added to my anxiety... I think the owner asked me questions for small talk like, \"what grade are you in?\" \"How old are you?\" \"how\\'s school?\" \"what\\'s your favorite subject\" (I am a highschool student btw) So, i politely answered her. She was nice. She wasn\\'t pushy or tried to \"baby talk\" to me just because I was 15. (Also i realized the owner took literally 5 minutes maybe 10 to cut my hair) I felt like she totally rushed it. Would it be fair for me to pay her $15 for 5 minutes of her time?? Apparently the owner\\'s husband was waiting for her outside in his car. And that she was going to leave soon. Um, your store closes at 5pm, i arrived at 1pm, you aren\\'t suppose to leave early?? Even if you had a customer, you\\'re supposed to make sure to cut her hair properly? So what you were planning to go with your husband to the beach or something that day, you can\\'t just be like \"oh i don\\'t have time for this, i have a life too\" Do you not care about your job and reputation? Eventually after staring at my hair and messing with it, I think i told her to add a little gel (she did last time and it made my hair look nice and styled) The hair gel gave my bangs texture and i was able to successfully part it to the right. I realized I needed to buy hair gel so my hair would look pretty. So eventually the hairdresser left with her husband. I stared at my hair some more, in the waiting area. I asked to borrow a comb so I could comb it to one side Eventually, i realized since the owner took very little time, she could have thinned out my hair better with scissors so it would look nicer and more even. But no, she said she was going to leave with her husband. And she knew i was not too sure I was confident with my hair because I kept on asking for mirrors and staring at my hair a lot. Plus I was asking her a lot of question after she finished my haircut. I guess she ignored my attempts of telling her to fix my hair and spend more time on it. \"oh it looks nice, i think it\\'s good enough already\" So yeah, afterwards she left. I left the hair salon, and then asked my mom to go to the beauty supply store. Since the hair gel/wax at the salon was $40, it was way too expensive. I found a nice hair gel at the supply store, it was cheap only $1-2 dollars, and it actually worked well on my hair. When I got home, I felt the same feeling of anxiety and felt depressed like I usually do after a haircut. I know I basically just shared you my story of my experience with hairdresser. I don\\'t know if this helped you, but i am glad if it did helped you somewhat! :D My advice is to have an idea of what you want your hair to look like, do you want a trim, do you want something like bangs? (nothing too crazy or complicated) If you want, you can also download some reference pictures of what you want your hair to look like.. This will be easier for you to describe to the hair dresser what kind of haircut you want. This will avoid miscommunication and avoid the person to mess up your hair, and you ending up paying $$$ for a ugly haircut. But you probaly wouldn\\'t need a picture if you wanted something simple like getting your hair trimmed at the ends. Also be polite. If the hairstylist makes small talk and asks you questions about your personal life, answer their questions. Just be polite. Be yourself. That\\'s all the advice I have, i\\'m sorry if i am bad at giving advice, but good luck! I relate to you a lot, i usually give short answers when asked questions too. Many of us have anxiety when it comes to getting a haircut. If you want, you can pm me! or add me as a friend or something (lol) good luck, have a nice day!\\')', 'labels': ['not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect', 'related to an outdoor space with negative effect'], 'scores': [0.38896799087524414, 0.2096112221479416, 0.2071712464094162, 0.19424958527088165]}\n",

But, as you probably already know that... I\\'ve been in your position of always being afraid that I will have nothing to say and things will go awkward and she will think of me as a weirdo. The thing is, unless you go and actually do it, you will ALWAYS feel like that, you won\\'t wake up one day and feel confident and feel like you could strike a conversation with anyone about anything. However, if you start doing the things you are afraid of, you will see that your mind is magnifying the \"danger\" of talking with people 1000x times. Not once in my life I regreted doing something that I was afraid to do because of my social anxiety. After I actually do it, I always think to my self \"it wasn\\'t so bad\", or \"I actually had fun\". Why avoid social events from work or family where dozens of people will attend? There won\\'t be a spotlight on you where everyone will look at you and judge you negatively the moment you enter the room. Socializing is a skill that needs to be practiced. If you never go into a pool because you don\\'t know how to swim, you will never learn to swim. But if you decide to go into the pool and practice, eventually, you will be a good swimmer. In the begining it will be scary, you may swallow a bit of water and stay in the border of the pool, not going very far so you won\\'t drown, but if you keep pushing yourself to go deeper little by little, the day that you can swim effortlessly will come. The same serves to socializing. You have to put yourself in situations where you will be forced to socialize, and you have the perfect opportunity for that with that girl from work. Throughout the years I\\'ve wasted many chances of socializing and making friends because of my social anxiety. As I said, at 23 years old I had never kissed a girl. It just happened when I decided that I would not run from social situations, as painful as they might be in the beginning. Today I can talk with just about anyone, although I\\'m still not a social butterfly (never will be) and despite still being very anxious. Summarizing: things will not get better unless you face the situations you are afraid of. Arrange a date with that girl, It won\\'t be as hard and/or as awkward as you might think it will be, it never is.\\')', 'labels': ['not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect', 'related to an outdoor space with negative effect'], 'scores': [0.8066380620002747, 0.08382599800825119, 0.057348012924194336, 0.05218794196844101]}\n",

            "{'sequence': '(\\'19 year old male from India here. I frequent this sub almost daily but rarely post or involve in discussions. But after seeing your post I just wanted to say something. So here goes my story: I have been suffering from severe SA for nearly 2 years. When i say \\'severe\\', i mean it for real. It started right when i joined college. At first i thought I was just nervous due to the new surroundings and people. It took me a year to realize i had a bigger serious problem and it had a name called \"Social Anxiety\". It was incredibly debilitating. I made very few close friends over these two years. They were the only people with whom i felt truly comfortable and was able to be myself. I was nervous around most other people. Sometimes it was mild. Sometimes it was so bad that my anxiety was written all over my face. I was visibly nervous around girls. Panic attacks are an usual thing for me. I simply cannot fake a smile when i am stressed because when i try to do so, my face literally starts twitching. I always avoided parties/movies/lunch with friends. I hated myself and had many sleepless nights over this. Also I am above 6 ft in a country where the avg height is 5\\'5\" . I get noticed easily. Obviously, it only made matters worse. The last thing anybody with SA wants is attention. Last year things got even worse. I was nervous even when around cousins,relatives and other close family friends. These people care for me and I know them since childhood. But now I am not able to be normal even with them. I lost total hope and exactly felt like how you feel right now. Except, not suicidal. I am a very brave person and never have gotten, excuse me, any stupid thoughts like that. I am in my college vacations right now. Two weeks back, I sat down and told myself: I want to make meaningful relationships with people and lead a normal happy life. I don\\'t want to die as a loner. So, I analyzed the lifestyle changes in me after I joined college which led to my SA: 1)I used to meditate everyday when in High School. It was a daily routine in our school. I stopped doing it after I joined college 2)Didn\\'t have access to internet back then. In India, mobile phones are prohibited in schools. Now I have unlimited access to internet and, you guessed it, porn. I started masturbating. 3) Used to play football with my friends and ran in relay races. No physical activity after joining college. Just a scrawny looking skinny fat guy now. So these are the changes i made two weeks back. I highly recommend you do them too : 1)Meditate for half an hour daily. I can\\'t stress this enough. SA is a psychological problem. It\\'s all in you head. If you can take control of the thoughts that go through in your head, you can do anything. Meditation helps you achieve exactly that. There is a saying \"One who conquers his mind can conquer the world\". Meditate and condition yourself to think positively. 2)Join the gym. 3)Give the nofap life a try.There has been no scientific evidence of correlation between SA and nofap. Some say it is just placebo. But who cares. I am willing to do whatever it takes to get rid of SA. Strictly no PMO. No fantasizing either. Just focus your attention on something else. It gives a sense of confidence and self esteem 4)When in a conversation, don\\'t try to hide you SA or be normal. Open your ears and listen to what they are talking about. Try to involve yourself in the discussion. SA will naturally disappear Man, I swear I already notice a big difference. Today, 2 of my friends came to my house( a guy and a girl). They are extremely outgoing and extroverted people. Just the exact opposite of me. We were talking about stuff and at some point, they both started talking laughingly about how \"shy\",\"different\",\"innocent(in the sense I will never be able to pursue a romantic relationship)\" I am. Their intention wasn\\'t to hurt me. That\\'s just how they talk. Very open and straightforward. Usually, a situation like this enough to warrant a panic attack and just freeze. But it FUCKING DIDN\\'T HAPPEN THIS TIME. I won\\'t say, i was extremely comfortable. But i was able to laugh it out along with them. I survived it. I am proud of myself now. I am confident enough to do anything right now. I hope this confidence stays with me forever. Just remember one thing. \"Don\\'t cry for it. Run for it\". Don\\'t lose hope.

What we're going to do is get in groups of five (and I have only one friend on campus and she isn't going to sign up so, you know, social anxiety), make a report on something over the course of five weeks (one class per week) and give a presentation. This is really good for my social anxiety. I hope I can get to know some people because right now whenever I have a work group we talk, and then it's goodbye forever basically. Also working in groups sounds good in general and giving a presentation too. However. I'm so scared I won't have enough time because of this class. My mum is kind of pushing me to do it because it'll be good for me, and I kind of want to do it, but I'm so scared that I won't have enough time to study and work on the things that will actually get me a grade. Because it's not just that 1,5 hours at school, it's also a 3 hour journey (total) and then of course lots of things to do at home.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'IMO, you\\'re doing 2 things that aren\\'t helping your anxiety. 1) You\\'re focusing too much on the prize. Telling yourself \"I\\'m probably never going to get that iPhone\" is not what will be helping you make a friend. The iPhone is an incentive your mother has set before you because she thinks you\\'re unmotivated. She thinks you don\\'t have friends because you just aren\\'t finding the motivation to make friends by yourself for whatever reasons. Social anxiety has nothing to do with motivation. Maybe you do have motivation but you\\'re just too scared. This is just one of the many possible effects of this type of anxiety. Maybe thats whats affecting you too. Maybe its another reason. Point is, motivating yourself with the idea of the iPhone won\\'t give you the internal strength to overcome your anxiety. In fact, in most case, the bigger the incentive is, the more pressure it will give you because of what you might be losing. SA has a tendency to make us overthink, and usually in a more pessimistic way. Which brings me to point #2. 2) Your vision of the challenge is too demanding. Imagine you have to climb a tall mountain but you\\'re scared of heights. What do you do? Are you going to be fine telling yourself \"I absolutely need to force myself to climb that mountain\"? Is this going to help with your fear of heights? Of course not. You will most likely say \"Hey, there is a little safe ledge right there. Lets try getting there first and see how it goes\". So you do it because its not as scary and you climb it and come back down once you reach it or when you feel you can\\'t go higher. You see how it goes. You adjust the height of your next objective. You try again. This is an analogy thats similar to Making a friend for someone with social anxiety. You\\'re trying to make a friend, which is very scary. And right now you\\'re sort of in the mindset of forcing yourself to jump into it face first, which is triggering your anxiety because of the risks you\\'re anticipating. Try setting a simpler objective for yourself, like saying \"Hi\" to someone. See how that goes. Try again on another occasion. And again. Each time, analyse how that went. Did the person answer back? Yes? Point for you! No? No worries, all people as sovial as one another and its not your fault. Try with someone else. Once you feel a bit more comfortable with that, raise the stakes just a little more. Maybe ask \"How are you?\" this time or introduce yourself with \"Hey, I\\'m X!\". Rinse repeat. And you just keep slowly going higher until you reach the summit because you reduced your fear. Once you can speak to someone and feel more comfortable, start talking about your interests and ask about their interests. People like to talk about themselves in general. Find someone who has similar interests as you. Use them to create a bond. Hang out with that person over the common interest. And voilà, you have a friend. Everybody is able to do hard things under the right conditions. Its just that the fear is not as strong for everyone, it doesn\\'t have the same effects on everyone, and doesn\\'t take the same time to fix it for everyone. You can do this. It might take some time. Take all the time you need. Forget about the iPhone, its just going to put more pressure on you. You got this.

Just because no doubt people exist that struggle far more intensely with SA doesn't mean that people who are having more 'everyday' struggles like phone anxiety, asking the bill, dealing with evaluations or presentations, suddenly stop having things they find genuinely difficult and distressing. If you ask a hundred people with SA what it's like, some will tell you it's crippling their ability to go outside entirely, while others will tell you they overall manage to function pretty well but in a few sore areas it's a real source of distress and avoidance. I think you will know best where on this scale you lie, and in what situations you might find it useful to summarise your experiences as 'this particular situation is a social anxiety thing for me' over 'nah I'm just a regular kind of antsy and a little bit of motivation does the trick'.

If it doesn't make you happy, there's no law or rule that says you have to. It's so, so needlessly difficult to just exist, as a person, if you spend so much time comparing the way you are today to an idealised version of yourself, or pointing out to yourself just how many expectations you're not living up to. Expectations and ideals are just that: ideas. They're not real, they can't be real. They can give you a sense of direction if you think they're worth going for (and don't be afraid to admit when something just isn't that important to you at all), but that's all they need to do. You're not fucking up, you're not 'running behind' by not meeting arbitrary standards that other people and you yourself have decided on. If setting a goal too high, too low, or too far removed from the things you value makes you feel like shit, then take a good long look at these goals and consider updating them to the sort of expectations that make you feel like you're able to breathe. For example: 'I want to try giving it my best shot, but it's fine if most days I just don't have the spoons to do much'. 'I'm gonna be open to making new friends whenever I can, but if I don't really click with anyone I'm not gonna beat myself up over it'. 'I don't know what's gonna be in store for me, but I'll try to see the bright side and have a good time'. Patience, self-compassion, open-mindedness, a little courage, humility,... all those things are things you can try to exercise at any time, anytime you think they're needed. 'Having more friends' or 'getting a degree without a single delay' or 'earning my parents' respect' are all things that depend on more than just things in your own control, meaning if you judge yourself based on these things, you always run the risk of feeling stressed our or disappointed. These are things you can want, but not things you should determine your value or success by. And, as many have said: you're not the only one, and you're not gonna be the last to make it work in the end :) Not seeing a way out doesn't mean there isn't one, and believing that just maybe this feeling of hopelessness has it all wrong is a great first step in making it lose its grip on you.

The improv class I joined is based around how improv can be related to real life, like how thinking on the spot for performing an improv game can also be used in conversations....super fun AND I can tell it\\'s helping even after just one class. And basically reminding myself as often as possible that the things I\\'m freaking out over really don\\'t mean ANYTHING in the big scheme of things. I realized that I get nervous around people because connecting with others is important to me and many people naturally get nervous about the things that are important to them. I\\'ve decided to start viewing anxiety as a gift that shows me what I value most, rather than a bad thing that holds me back. It only holds me back when I let it. Obviously accepting it and taking action despite it is really hard but there\\'s no way around it, and it\\'s seriously starting to help. I wrote myself a little list of reminders from bits and pieces of different self-help articles online for when I feel anxious around people: -Imagine every person you meet is the most wonderful, talented, kind person ever, even if it’s deep down. They’re is a lot you can learn from them if you discover their interests. Know that they won’t judge you for the mistakes you usually judge yourself for, because that wonderful amazing person is too kindhearted to ever judge you. Think about what they’re saying rather than what you’re going to say. Basically just put your focus on them and learning more about them. -Focus more on what you’re doing/where you’re going/what’s happening rather than what to talk about with someone. For example I don’t think “what will we talk about?” when I go to the grocery store with mom, Im thinking about what to buy, or I\\'m comfortable and present and enjoying the little trip because I\\'m thinking about what we\\'re doing rather than what we\\'re saying. -Make yourself comfortable wherever you are! Each place you’re in is your current home. Make it feel that way by taking up space to make yourself comfortable. Sit on chairs like they\\'re your comfy old couch or your throne. Making the body feel relaxed and \"at home\" will help the mind chill out and be less rigid. -Realize and notice that some other people around you are probably not fully comfortable either. Just as a little reminder that you’re probably not the only anxious person in the room. Look for little signs in how people are standing or fidgeting or not socializing. Bonus if you empathize and go talk to them cause you know how they feel! -Greet new people with an attitude like “heyy, you’re my old friend from summer camp!” I know that\\'s a lot so maybe using 1 or 2 in any given situation would be more helpful, just so you don\\'t get overwhelmed. I also find that thinking positive thoughts helps move forward. And by this I don\\'t mean happy-positive, I mean YES-positive. Instead of thinking \"I should stop being anxious\", I think \"It\\'s okay that I\\'m feeling anxious, but I\\'m going to focus more on _____\". Make sense? Cause if you tell your mind to STOP thinking something, it\\'s just gonna keep thinking it. Shifting your focus works much more smoothly. Again, takes some practice, but molding the mind is possible! And remember that YOU aren\\'t overthinking about how other people talk/act, so why would they be thinking about how YOU talk/act? People really aren\\'t as judgemental as we assume them to be! And if they seem to be, it\\'s usually because they\\'re judging themselves even more and are hiding that feeling with outward judgement. You can definitely do it, just keep pushing yourself, and acceptance is really amazing for allowing the icky feelings to just come and go in their own time. They aren\\'t a part of you, they\\'re just thoughts. If anything, they\\'re making you stronger and more accepting once you start to recognize them as that.

In practice, the genetic factor in mental health issues for where its effects are subtle, I guess it doesn't actually matter that much.

To me, the distinction of how well a problem responds to environmental change is what makes the difference between an issue of habits, coping skills, stressful environments, physical health etc., and one that seems to really originate right there in the squishy brain stuff. Some problems can turn out to be both, where making changes already lightens the load, but a snarl remains that seems to just not go away or improve without medication. My husband worked on his anxiety problems and things did improve, but at some point, even under the best circumstances, it turned out that his brain just loved to make mountains out of molehills all by itself - OCD sure sounds fun. At that point, acknowledging the issue as 'actually neurochemical', regardless of cause, helped us make the step to tackling it at that level, too.

(TLDR bottom) • 25 male • Work fulltime at a restuarant. Expo and cook. • Lived about 6 months now with hypocrital (but kind/loving) mother and mentally/emotionally confrontational stepfather. I dont say abusive because i don\\'t allow him to effect me. I learned a long time ago what he says/does is not okay and his opinion means nothing and i adamantly defend myself whenever i slip and can\\'t just ignore him. Needless to say the house is is hectic and argumentative because of him. • Single for 3 years • haven\\'t had sex in 3 years (cane veet close 1.5 years ago but we just made out  and stuff and then she said \"I\\'m on my period :( wanna cuddle and watch the office with me tho?\" But sadly i couldnt break my streak D: she was sweet tho but didnt want to keep seeing eachother D: it was at a party and she was just having fun didnt want to talk after didnt even give her number :/ • i have never been in a serious or a long term relationship. I have only been with 5 women and i am 25 :/ • I stay inside %98 of my time not including work or arrends which i don\\'t want to use ti meet people. • live in a rural area and no friends. • Also suffer depression so everything boring af. I need help though. I can\\'t really explain this, i dont know. This last year (turn 25 a year ago) has been strange. Between turning 24 and now, i feel like i have grown tremendously. Mentally, emotionally and nost importantly for this sub, sociallj. I still live at home, dont go out, bored, single and no friends blah blah. So you\\'re probably like\"So basically tou didn\\'t really grow at all?\" Well what is different now is that i feel like my perspective has changed dramatically. My confidense has grown. My passions have returned and while i am still shy i feel like tmfor the first time in 8-10 years i have this strange unnatural feeling of what i can ontl deacribe as motivation to improve this. Sure i still am alone, single and live at home but for once in my life instead of just sittinf and thinking about how pitiful i am i am just feel content. This contentness has allowed me tmregain some of my old passions. Getting these passions back have really helped with my self confidence. I feel like i am no longer just some lower class, single, friendless guy at his parents house. I feel like this regular. BRoke, but working class. Nice, single guy.

I made friends in the neighborhood/in schook as a kid. I made friends when i was in the military (gone now) but i have not made a new friend in like 3+ years. Even that girl i *almost* hooked up with i had just met that night at a party, she was in college(ie school) and she literally was moving away that weekend and ought ne an uber home in the morning. Didnt wanna be my friend. Where can i go to meet people? Where can adults go to hang out for free/cheap besides their home (at my parents) what are some tips? How should approach these people? When i am out running errands or commuting etc i do not want to meet people so i need some other way like scheduled preferably. Those are the only times i can *truly* be alone. ** TLDR** For the first time in nearly a decade i am able to enjoy the things i used to love but somehow lost interest. The urge to meet new people and talk to them about tbat stuff and stuff that interests me and actually have the urge to make friends but i am so socially inept from a decade of social anxiety I HAVE FORGOTTON HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS!. What do i do in those situations where like 4 people ate all talking amongst themselves and i just draw a complete blank  and have no input i can muster or even think of. How do i not sound like a robot in 1on1 convos? How do i talk about stuff that will peak someones interest and hold their attention or make that human a friend? **I AM LOST SO ANYTHING HELPS.

But there was no way for me to know because I literally NEVER got asked to do anything. In 9th grade one of my friends asked me to his birthday party, but I was incredibly anxious all the days leading up to it, and he probably thought I was stuck up since I kept saying that I might have something to do that day. Luckily it got canceled, but I felt bad about it. I was also on the high school basketball team, but I never got invited when my teammates would all go hang out somewhere before our games. In 10th grade I was put in honors classes and made friends with multiple people in there, but didn’t get asked to do anything. In 11th grade, we had a Group project with 3 of my friends, and we we went to one of there houses and worked on it for 3 days. That was really fun, but they never invited me to anything after even though I was really good friends with them.(they would always hang out together). At the end of my senior year, I asked my best friend, (who doesn’t have SA, but doesn’t have very good social skills so he was labeled as weird), to hang out at my house for the first time ever (we were friends since 3rd grade...). He has been asking to come over the last few years, but I was to anxious to see him outside of school. So we be comes over, i was extremely nervous. Like really jittery and shaky voice. It was soooo awkward even though we had been friends forever. After breaking that first wall down, it got easier to hang out with him. At the end of high school though, I was depressed because I never hung out with all of my other friends and they were going to leave me behind and I wouldn’t get to see them anymore. I started at community college, and was sad that I would miss out on the “college experience”. I got my first job the summer after my freshmen year. It was in retail, and I was expecting to solve all of my social issues by working here. NOPE. After working for 3 months, my social anxiety didn’t improve one bit. BUT, I did learn a ton about myself and how I was different from everybody else. I also found out about Social Anxiety Disorder and Aspergers which explained a lot about myself. It allowed me to accept myself and not blame myself for not making close friends in school. Now, I wasn’t self conscious about not having friends, a girlfriend, or any of that crap. I stopped comparing myself to Normal People. I would do what I wanted to do, and set my own goals. I am currently a junior in college, and am doing the best I can. I know I’m going to make mistakes and embarrass myself sometimes, but I still am going to try. I sometimes get really anxious or depressed about what will happen in my future, but I can’t do anything except give it my best. You will do a lot better than you think in the future.

Strange imbalances between your level of experience, social and financial leverage, personal freedoms and new responsabilities... I think you'll benefit from realising real life isn't like the movies. There might be the occasional highlight to some periods in people's lives, but around every shining peak of 'ammagah livin' the life' there's weeks and months of routine slog, stupid setbacks, insecurities, unexpected surprises and absolutely banal events that can be easily mistaken for bad omens or lifelong scars. Most things don't matter as much as they feel like. Few people get to their thirties without realising that 'people make plans, life doesn't care', and that the only way to know what the future will bring is to somehow end up right in the middle of it. I'm 27 now, and if there's one thing I'd tell my 18-year old self to worry less, assume less, just give things a try without trying to guess too hard what the result will be. You’ll be fine in the end if you can avoid the worst fuckups (and not having many or any friends or having low grades or not knowing what you want aren’t ‘worst fuckups’). There'll be a lot you'll have pretty much no control over. What other people think, want, do is all 100% not up to you. It takes two people to have a bond, two people who each think ‘hey, this other person is pretty cool’. The only thing you do have (for the most part) control over is your own thoughts, your own judgements and values, your own choices. Those will define how a situation impacts you, and whether a setback will turn your life into a living hell, or whether it’ll be something you take in stride and get past with minimal heartache. Observation: the only reason high school friends are such a thing is because people who spend a lot of time cooped up together tend to develop a social relationship (good or bad), because it's impossible not to kind of get to know someone if you see them for several hours every week day. Familiarity and forced interaction means it’s easy to get comfy with people and have pleasant interactions at a fairly low active effort ‘cost’. In college and adult life you've got more flexibility to where you spend your time and who with, with the downside that life will no longer offer you easy-friend-making environments on a silver platter. It takes effort to get out the door, man, I don’t put on my outside pants for just any random Joe Shmoe : P And once you’ve got the freedom to plan your own activities during the day, you’ll realise that you have an ‘activation energy’, a sort of ‘cost’ to deciding to socialize, too. If what you get out of it isn’t worth the effort, welp, you lose touch with each other. How many friends you have in the end also doesn't matter for shit. I always thought I'd rather be lonely than beg for attention of people who don't care about me and that I also don't care about. End result: after enduring a long stretch of finding nobody interesting, by now I've got a few close friends I 100% trust and that's perfectly fine by me. Invest actively in people who have things in common with you, that you actually enjoy spending time with. Life's too short to waste it chasing poor quality bonds. If you have good ones, then put in some work to keep the contact alive. Don't be surprised if it turns out that outside of a school context you honestly don't have that much to share with each other though. That happens, often, and you’d hardly be the first to start way overthinking what this implies. It implies nothing, it just means that that particular friendship was fueled and facilitated more by circumstance than by an active desire to invest in the friendship. Hanging out with friends can be fun, if you have good ones, but if there's nobody around who also feels 'man, I'd love to hang out with this person' then welp, can't do more than be yourself anyway and try to grow as a person on the way. It’s up to other people to decide if they like what they see, and their opinions have nothing to do with your worth as a person. The ability to be confident in your own worth, your own choices, your own values, even in absence of other people actively supporting that, is a very big one to cultivate. Try to focus on what YOU can do, with your own power, each day to make your life feel workable and worth living to you. The rest is frills and good things will come by. Taking care of yourself and your mental health well is the best way to make sure you’ll have the alertness and the courage to take advantage of those opportunities, no matter if they come often or only once in a blue moon.')\", 'labels': ['not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect', 'related to an outdoor space with negative effect'], 'scores': [0.8179939985275269, 0.0743899792432785, 0.0567660816013813, 0.050849951803684235]}\n",

You don\\'t need to actually believe the alternative, you just want to recognise that there is in fact another way to think about things. The dysfunctional thought record on this page (the second one) I think it\\'s ideally suited to social anxiety: The main thing I hate about counseling is that therapists don\\'t seem to understand that it\\'s nearly impossible to out of the blue start thinking differently. What the thought record does is it helps you recognise an better alternative thought, but by repeatedly recognising it and creating a better alternative, you start to strengthen that thought pathway in your mind. Eventually, you want it to be automatic. It\\'s like you\\'re an athlete that needs to train a million times; take that shot from the three point line over and over and over again in order to make sure your throw isn\\'t off anymore. The first time going to make the shot you might feel paralyzed, but helped along on how to do it perfectly, you\\'ll be able to do it. That isn\\'t to say that purely cognitive therapy is effective however. In order to make meaningful progress, you need to start doing adaptive behaviors, which the cognitive therapy hopefully helps people do. Joining a club is the cliche example, but joining a gym, taking a more social job, taking a class where you have to interact with others, volunteering, or taking up a sport are all good opportunities to practice social skills. You can know in your mind exactly how to throw a three pointer, but unless the opportunity to practice is there, you wouldn\\'t be very successful if thrown into a game. Social anxiety used to be called social phobia, and a lot of the tactics employed in treating phobias is also useful. Creating what they call a \"fear hierarchy\" and working from what bothers you least to what bothers you most should help get rid of a lot of fear/anxiety. For example, if you were afraid of tarantulas and you had to live with two of them loose in your house, you would eventually lose a lot of fear. You might\\'ve already known they wouldn\\'t hurt you, but repeatedly seeing them and experiencing no negative effect helps strengthen the \"spiders are harmless\" part of your mind. The main thing is to take baby steps, and have support there when something challenges your ability to continue.

I remember feeling vaguely proud of myself for all of thirty seconds after walking out of the theoretical driver's exam with a perfect score, after I'd procrastinated on taking it for years past due out of fear of driving and fear of failure. I called my parents to inform them I passed, then on the way home I instantly felt depressed and worthless again, because on top of having procrastinated and being 'one of those losers that did everything too late', I wasn't even capable of getting motivation and encouragement from this hurdle I'd overcome. It felt like 'that was easy, what kind of stupid person would even make a fuss and think this is worth applause'. It's toxic, it really is, and it's good to be frustrated and want to change this. Giving yourself fair credit and recognition for your efforts, to accept that you just did a difficult thing \\\\*mentally\\\\*, that it doesn't matter how other people do, what matters is how YOU are improving and working on this, those are all important for staying motivated and inspired in what you do. Nobody performs well if they're denied the basic fuel of satisfaction and internal reward after struggling past something tough. You're not a failure, but you are currently in a state where you clearly have problems giving yourself the space to breathe and feel worthy as a person as you are RIGHT NOW. It can often feel like 'if I achieve this one extra milestone I'll finally prove i'm not a total loser', except that finish line never comes. There will always be things you feel aren't quite what you want them to be, and if you stay in this mindset, you could become a billionaire curing cancer and still feel like you're 'not good enough'. There's often a background of high family expectations, high standards you set for yourself, and erm, actually being very capable but not having appropriate challenges on your own level, too, that can all come together to create this kind of persistent feeling that you're just not a worthy person and all your achievements are silly or pointless or embarrassing or 'don't really count'. That can take time to reverse, and I'd recommend considering professional help, like from a student counselor, to discuss this with and figure out practical things you can do to tackle these thoughts and the underlying beliefs that lead to them. For me it was a combination of perfectionistic high\\\\-achieving parents, a personality and interests that were anything but their idea of 'a successful person', social anxiety, and not being properly challenged at high school level. The things I was good at were either stupid and childish, or felt like I was getting good marks way too easily, and the things I was bad at I got mercilessly hounded for without getting the support I needed to feel hopeful that I could ever make those work out. Result: a pretty capable young adult who felt all she was good for was stupid stuff, that her real achievements were minor and no big deal, with a mountain of 'important' expectations I felt I would never live up to anyway. Take yourself seriously, and take this problem seriously. It's not your fault that you ended up with these kinds of automatic feelings that deny you any satisfaction and motivation, but you CAN take responsability and find ways to make your life a whole lot less bleak if you tackle this at the root. It's very much worth it. You gave your presentation, you proved you have good skills even with the anxiety, that's a puzzle piece to claim for your full picture. Tackle things one step at a time, 'Rome wasn't built in one day', and social bonds and professional stability just \\\\*take fucking time\\\\*. Even if you feel you're running against the clock, you're not. It doesn't matter what'll happen a year from now, what you might try focusing on more is what's happening now, today, tomorrow, your plans for this week to just keep putting one foot in front of the other.

Your path is yours, impatience just makes things feel slow and stuck and pressured. Have a bit of faith that things will work out, it's allowed to be a journey that isn't always graceful or impressive.

            "{'sequence': '(\\' Therapy isn\\'t supposed to be a patch on a scratch. It\\'s not medication, it\\'s a course in general health, mental health. The aim of therapy is to help you understand your problem so you can make better decisions, and to give you guidance on how to help yourself spot and grab handholds to get yourself out of tough spots. No amount of therapy or medication will make life totally free of challenges or unhappiness or anxiety. Therapy exists to teach people better coping skills so instead of freaking out stuck in a pit, people learn to calm down (this is just a stupid pit, not the realm of the dead), remind themselves they\\'re capable of getting out of the pit, and then undertake the kind of actions and self-regulation needed to get out of the pit. The more often a person successfully gets themselves out of pits large and small, the more they will train the skills needed to get out (training their arm muscles is like forming healthy sleeping, eating, exercise and self-care habits), and the less agonised and more confident they will be when faced with new pits (\\'eh, this sucks but I\\'m not going to get overwhelmed, I know what to do and I\\'ll manage\\'). Learning coping skills, learning how to be resilient, learning from active practice, that takes time, and often some support to make sure that once you\\'re out of a pit, \\\\*you reinforce good behaviour\\\\*. Learning how to deal with setbacks and failure is a big one, you have no idea how easily perfectionism can make every puddle into the pits of Tartarus. Look at this difference in reaction to a learning moment: \"Hahah, fuck you, pit, this time I got a little better at this and so, I kinda freaked out there, maybe next time I can...\" \"Oh my GOD that pit was HORRID, I\\'m such a loser for even struggling with this stupid tiny pit, oh man I hope I never ever have to do that again, look at how I fucked up this, and fucked up that...\" Who do you think is going to have a better chance of keeping a level head and getting out of the inevitable next pit? Tell you what, learned helplessness and constant self-undermining is a WAY worse problem than social anxiety. The point of therapy isn\\'t to make sure nothing is ever difficult or uncomfortable again. It\\'s to help you become the sort of person who, when faced with difficulties, who makes the most helpful coping choices as often as possible, and who understands how to encourage themselves consistently. Those are life skills that take time and practice to build, and those are the ones that will help make anxiety from a constant presence into just an inconvenience you can manage where it matters. Incidentally, taking medication can be a helpful tool in building confidence. To experience success, it helps to get a little help, like a hand reaching down into the pit to help your efforts pay off. Overtime you may find your pit-climbing skills have improved enough that you can encourage yourself, take a running start, and pull yourself up. Being stuck in pits sucks, and being stressed out makes it hard to learn new things. It\\'s okay to still be learning, and to use a helpful tool like medication that makes learning these new things easier. Just don\\'t forget to make use of the benefits, and learn the most positive lessons you can. \\')', 'labels': ['not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'related to an outdoor space with negative effect', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect'], 'scores': [0.5974533557891846, 0.16821077466011047, 0.15274009108543396, 0.08159580081701279]}\n",

This gurl hurt a man with similar views as this user a year and a half ago and then strung 'im along for half a year before hurting 'im and then the guy let the world know and starting whining, (rightfully), but then they tried again this past winter a few months after that, but the gurl was clearly cringing at the man's sphere of influence and views and was thoroughly brainwashed by that point, went back to hurting people, only creeping outside 'er echo chamber to slam others for money ad likes, is enabled by SYCOPHANTS who misrepresent EVERYTHING for their 'queen' and IGNORANCE reigns supreme with 'er, and FEAR. The man then crypto-bytched on twittr for 6 months, almost, despite saying in a poem the previous fall that 'e was not bitter and should've known better, yet tries to delete the poem and shows bitterness at 50 percent for months.

He’s actually kind of nice about it, and he explained why one would need good communication skills at work, but there is still a place for someone quiet in an office. What hurts most is when they ask why I’m quiet, I respond with “That’s just who I am, I’m a quiet person” or something, and they go “Oh, we can tell. Everyone can tell”. They probably don’t mean it in a rude way, they’re just saying it, but considering it’s my biggest insecurity, it’s hard to get past it. So anyways.

He was talking about other people in the office who are also introverts (I guess), asked me if something’s wrong or if something’s bothering me.

He also asked how I managed university, and said that if our team at work was any bigger or smaller it would have been even harder for me to adapt. He made a lot of sense but I can’t help but feel like even more of a broken person now and I can’t stop pitying myself. I told him that I realize all these things, and I think about them frequently, to which he responded “Don’t think about it, just do it”.

I\\'m now 26 and I\\'ve been living with my girlfriend for the past 2 years.

That won\\'t be easy, that\\'s going to take a long time, you\\'ll doubt yourself pretty often and you\\'ll feel that you aren\\'t improving all the time. Your anxiety is good to convince you of the worst and that\\'s part of what you need to learn to identify and ignore. You can do it though, you just need to keep pushing. #1 Start small My first step of fixing my social anxiety was so small that it was before I realized that I had to works on it. I started to go so movies alone pretty often. That helped me so much without even realizing. It gave me a subject to talk about, it pushed me to go outside in public, it was a fun activity and it made me learn that it was alright to have fun alone because so many people were doing it too. #2 Do it at your own speed You won\\'t help yourself if you try to do too much too fast, you\\'ll just fail and give more power to your anxiety by giving it tangible example. Do it a tiny step at a time and don\\'t be afraid to skip something if required. #3 Practice make perfect Being social is a skill and just like any skill, you need to train it. Just like any other skills, some are better than others, some need less training than others and some make it look like extremly easy when it is not. You\\'ll become better the more you do it. #4 Whenever your social anxiety may happen, have a plan B ready That helped me a lot managing my anxiety. Just the idea of being able to go away at any point made me more confortable. It start to be overwhelming? Well I have homeworks to do, I need to sleep earlier after a short night, something to take care of that you forgot, lunch to make, need to go to the supermarket before it close, etc... #5 Ignore what your anxiety tell you and be selfish That\\'s not an easy one because as I said the anxiety can be convincing. Why you need to be selfish? Because it will keep convincing you that people don\\'t like you, they don\\'t want to spend time with you, etc... It\\'s all false but you probably won\\'t be able to convince yourself of that because of your anxiety. If people didn\\'t want to spend time with you, they wouldn\\'t, if they still did, well it\\'s their problem, not yours. #6 Find social activities to do How can you practice if you have nothing social to do?

            "{'sequence': \"('I was in such a similar situation 2 months ago. I was 18 (I just turned 19 in October) and I didn’t have a job. I worked a seasonal job at Macy’s for 2 months last year and then haven’t worked because I didn’t want to go to another interview. Other people have good tips. Another thing I want to add: getting a job (and I know it’s really hard and scary) will help you. Because you’ll be forced to be social and it will get easier. I even found that I when I had my job at Macy’s and when I got my current job I became a lot less likely to be anxious in my day to day social interactions, like in school. When I didn’t have a job I slipped back into a much more anxious state because I got used to not talking to people. I actually find that interacting with customers as a cashier is a social skill that improves super quickly and becomes pretty easy in my experience. This is because you know what to expect. There is a “script” in a sense of what to say, and it dozens really matter what they respond. Just do what you have to do and they’re gone. It’s not personal, which makes it better for me. I don’t have to worry about impressing them or being too this or too that, or coming up with something funny or interesting to say. I’m just ringing them up. The difficult part is definitely interviewing and interacting with managers/coworkers and the like. If you’d rather not interact with coworkers, get a job at a big department stores like Macys. I actually disliked how isolated I felt there, but for some people that might work for them. Really you just have to force yourself. I know hats often a pretty annoying and useless thing to say to people with social anxiety. But my point is, you are most likely going to be nervous, and that’s okay. That doesn’t mean, though, that you can’t do it. My current job required me to go in for an interview and I was terrified. But I just drove there and didn’t let myself think about it too much. Then I got there and instead of waiting in my car I instantly walked in. I was nervous but sitting around wouldn’t change that. And once you’re there, either at your job or at an interview, everything will be okay. This is hard for me to explain, but it just gets a little better once you’ve thrown yourself (and you’re he only one who can do that) into the situation. Sure, you could be shy and awkward and anxious and lack social skills, but you’ll be there. People are interacting with you and you’re interacting back, however you are doing it. Chances are you won’t run and hide in a corner, is kind of what I’m saying. You’ll be doing it, and what happens happens at that point. At my interview, my manager asked me “are you shy?” Honestly I hated that because I was trying so hard to fake that I wasn’t shy, and I didn’t feel like I was acting quiet, just maybe a little anxious. But I said no. He responded saying “it’s okay if you are. But you’re just quiet, then?” I said I guess and he wrote on his piece of paper “not shy, just quiet.” On my first day a few of my coworkers saw it and laughed pretty hard at it. “Who wrote that about her??” They said. Hey weren’t making fun of me, in fact they saw it as quite odd that he would find that relevant to write down. I laughed with them. They never treated me weird because of it, I mean they probably saw me as shy too. But it was okay. Okay this is getting long. But what I’m saying is that as a person who was just in this spot, I know that it seems impossible for you, but it really isn’t. I’m not trying to downplay anyone’s difficulty with this, because I know how hard it is. And I still feel socially anxious at work all of the time, and I’m not best friends with my coworkers, and when customers try to make small talk with me I’m not really good at it at all. But that’s okay, because I have a job and it pays and I actually really enjoy going there. For a while I got anxious every time I had to go in for my shift. I would have butterflies in my stomach getting ready, driving there, and especially walking in the door. But after a while this went away. If you get a job and even after a month or so you still feel extremely anxious there and it isn’t getting better (especially if the anxiety persists throughout the entire shift) consider getting a different job. Although that’s very scary, feeling comfortable (or as comfortable as a person with SA can be working a social job, lol) at your job should be a priority. By no means am I saying that social anxiety can just go away with repetition or whatever, but if you tend to get stronger anxiety related to new situations, staying in those situations until it’s no longer new can help a little. Also, sometimes certain environments can be very anxiety inducing for some people, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t have a job in general, which is what I want to point out. You might always feel anxiety but the level can vary so if you hate the environment of your job think about changing it. Another tip I have is maybe getting a job with a friend? If there is anywhere where one of your friends work that is hiring, it might be helpful to work with them because you can ask them about things you’re unsure about, such as social norms there or just basic job questions you’re too afraid to ask coworkers. Okay so I rambled again but basically- people with social anxiety can have jobs and hat includes you! That’s my main message.

I find that being sleep deprived does make me less anxious in general, and too much caffeine makes me more anxious. But it all depends on amounts, too. Ive done a little research on this. Basically when you’re tired, your brain slows down. On the other hand, if you drink too much caffeine, your brain speeds up. Someone who has a tendency to get anxious would be affected by this as their thoughts might race and contribute to the anxiety. Similarly, a tired brain doesn’t work as fast and therefore might be less anxious. However, I have also found that for some people, a sped up brain process also means less time for consideration. Some people with SA including myself have a problem where they aren’t impulsive enough with their speech- they think something and instead of just saying it like a lot of people do, they think about it too much until it’s no longer relevant. I often think that people with SA have he opposite problem of people who have “no filter”- we filter it too much, afraid of getting judged and what not. For me, if I am sleep deprived this lessens my anxiety in situations where I have to do a presentation in front of groups of people, or go to an interview or a new class or something of that sort. Things that bring out strong symptoms like a racing heart or sweaty palms. If I were to drink caffeine i would feel so much worse. For everyday interactions, however, caffeine or simply enough sleep makes interactions where I don’t necessarily experience physical symptoms better. If I’m hanging out with a group, for example, and I’m tired, I’ll tend to stay isolated and I won’t really say things that come to my head. But if I am more awake and my brain is running faster, there is less overthinking and I have more energy to open my mouth and speak up. I don’t know how much of this is 100% true, but this is my experience and the information I’ve found.

Conversations would be structured and designed to incrementally promote self awareness and expression. The aim is to make what's meaningful yet uncomfortable, comfortable through repeated exposure.

(I knew that other people had it on them as well, but I wasn't sure if I should hide it or not. I didn't hide mine, and all I was told, was to not smoke it inside and I was let in. We all smoked anyway). I noticed a lot of people didn't wear jackets, only sweaters. I had a jacket on so I was wondering what I was doing wrong (turns out there was an optional $3 coat check-in at the venue). I opted not to check my jacket in, and just held it in my hands the whole time. The ticket said to arrive at 8pm, but the show didn't start until 10pm so the 2 hours of waiting once I actually got inside was annoying. I'm over 21 so I was able to grab a drink at the bar and wait. The bar was at the back of the venue so I was able to see the stage, and the people gathered around it. There were other people who seemed to be alone where I was standing so I didn't feel too out of place standing there. By the time I finished my drink, and the show officially began, my anxiety was completely forgotten. I made my way into the middle of the crowd, and had fun. I got in mosh pits and everything! It was a blast!! I even cried when the group performed their song geared towards the mentally ill and the socially anxious, so having these intense emotions rooted in a general understanding of mental struggle with a group of strangers was a great experience. Long-term that experience hasn't changed me though. I'm still pretty socially anxious and I'm still depressed, but it's something I'd love to do again. Next time they come to my city I'm going to go with someone and see how my experiences change. **TL;DR: You should do it!** *Edit: Grammar/spelling/punctuation.* *Edit 2:* Also, if there was a single thing that I wish I did differently, it would be talking to someone. From the time I started waiting in line to the time I got inside my Uber to go home, I was there for about 4 hours and didn't have a single conversation inside or outside that venue.

I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this but I need help and I'm not sure where to go. If this post doesn't apply here, then I apologize. *warning: long post* I'm spiralling very hard right now. I think some of the worst experiences I've had with anxiety and depression was when I felt like I have no control over the decisions I make. Today I feel that way and it's killing me on the inside. Honestly, most of the time, I'm proud of myself okay? I have come such a long way from having panic attacks about talking on the phone to actually being able to have small talk with someone normally. Most of the reason why I've been this way before was because my parents over sheltered me to the point where I was not allowed to go out with friends or talk to people my age outside of school. I was suddenly thrown in the deep end during college and somehow managed to survive. My mother coddles me a lot. It's coming out of a place of unconditional love but sometimes it just feels so, so suffocating. I have to talk to her atleast once every two days or she says I don't have time for her or I'm making her sick with worry. When I'm staying away from home, she worries about the simplest things like the fact that it's cold outside and suggests I don't go out at all just because it's a little nippy. She often sends me snacks and other things through people who travel to and fro from my hometown to the city I live in. I hate it so so much Bec the idea of using people like this gives me unending anxiety and makes me feel really bad things like shame and despair and I feel terrible about being in their debt. I tell her every chance I get that I know what's best for me and I do not need certain things from her and whatever I need, I will ask for, unabashedly. She says yes and does what she wants anyway because she thinks it's for my benefit. The feeling of never being in control of some decisions but being forced to bear it's consequences is just so stressful. It does not make me feel good. I feel worthless and incompetent and hate talking to these people even more because it feels like I have an agenda when I'm grateful to them. Currently, I'm on a solo holiday trip in London. I've been planning to go and see this lovely city ever since I came to the UK two months ago. But the moment I told my mom about it, she called all the people we know who live close to London and made sure meet them and also gave them snacks and other luggage to give to me. My plan was to relax and get away and see the city. I didn't want any baggage. But here I am, two days in London and I haven't seen anything except train stations, distant relatives' homes and awkward smiles. I've been grovelling at them all this while for taking care of me and cooking for me, and I'm very grateful, trust me, I am. But I just wanted to relax on my own man. Why does she never let me take decisions? Why do I have to be portrayed as someone who has no prior planning when all these plans have been pushed onto me by someone else? Why doesn't she never listen? Never being heard hurts. Especially from someone who brought you up with utmost love. My mom is not the healthiest person. Telling her all this in the way she understands guarantees that she'll get hurt in the process so I have to eat my words and bear with it. She won't listen to what the problem is, but will only feel bad. Which makes me feel bad Bec I'm coming off as such an ungrateful, spoilt brat. I'm sick of doing other people's bidding because of social expectations. Sometimes it all feels like too much. Way too much. I keep going farther and farther from home to test how much more control I can get over my life but every time I'm reminded that I'm just a somebody's dear daughter. Nothing more.

My heart starts thumping like shit. “I can’t breathe.” I still have to pass this hall to get to the bathroom. It’s about 40 meters. So about 40 meters too long. “I hate myself.” Halfway through. Getting closer. Few steps ahead stands the door to safety. “I hope no one is inside.” I open the door. “Empty.” I get to the furthest stall and lock the door. I’m safe. Now I can breathe. I unlock the door. Step out and go wash my hands. Still no one else. I’m safe. Still have to walk two flights of stairs. Filled with people. “I want to go home.” I step out of the bathroom and start walking towards the stairs. “So far so good.” I get up the stairs and stand alone, waiting for class to start. “When are my friends here?” I feel so anxious and awkward standing alone. I take out my phone. Pretending to text someone, actually text myself. “I hate myself. Why am I like this?” I see one friend coming. “Fucking finally.” I take my earphones out and put my phone away. “Hi!” “Hello” I’m relaxed. A bit. We kind of just stay quiet because we’re both introverted and not talkative. She understands me and I understand her. I’m relieved. I can breathe. Class starts. The teacher opens the door and I walk in. Of course I take the seat I always sit at. It feels safe.

I am introverted. I like being the way that I am, but at the same time I always feel like I\\'m invisible or an afterthought to most of the people I meet in life. I don\\'t have any friends of my own. The few acquaintances that I do occasionally hang out with are hand-me-downs from my parents or my boyfriend. They\\'re nice people, but they don\\'t really connect with me very well and vice versa. As of right now, the only two people I talk to aside from my parents and my boyfriend are my friend George who also happens to be friends with my mom. He\\'s in his 40s and I am a 19 year old female. There is also this girl a year or two younger than me that I occasionally talk to on Instagram. We connected on the fact that we both have shitty abusive fathers, only difference is, I disowned mine and he\\'s dead to me, and she\\'s still stuck living with him. But now, we don\\'t talk as much anymore and I think that she has lost interest in continuing our friendship because I\\'ll text in response to her story about her bad days or her father doing some other god awful shit, and she won\\'t read or respond. People come and go and that\\'s ok, that\\'s life. I won\\'t ever stop caring about people simply because we grow apart. I always wish people well. I just feel like there is something wrong with me though. If I hang out with someone in person longer than 1-2 hours sometimes, I get bored, annoyed, anxious, I drift into la la land, etc. Even when I like the person or have nothing against them. I always end up wanting to retreat back to my place and hide. I blame my reclusive nature on being an only child who didn\\'t even like other kids growing up, I wasn\\'t allowed to be loud, run around the house, have loud toys, nothing. My childhood was always, \"sit down and shut up or play quietly in your room with the door shut.\" I was so scared to just be myself because I was afraid of what my father would do. He would beat my mother, yell, throw things, and lose his temper at the smallest mistakes we would make. My mom got me out of there when I was 5 and I tried to put myself out there and be like the other kids, but I was so awkward, self-conscious, and more thoughtful or cautious about my words and actions. It somewhat improved in my late high school years. Social-wise, those were the best couple years of my life. But, in the few months before graduation I noticed that my friends weren\\'t maturing and they didn\\'t really have any goals or aspirations. They didn\\'t really have any plans to improve themselves and work hard to get where they wanted to be. They just magically thought they were going to get there. I started to dislike them and I separated myself from the group. After graduation I was alone. I constantly go back and forth from enjoying solitude and not dealing with the drama that a group of friends can bring to feeling lonely and like I\\'m missing out on life. Like I\\'m just sitting on the couch every day just waiting for an epiphany or someone to message me out of the blue wanting to be friends. I don\\'t even care if its long distance anymore. My bf has a group of 2-3 guys that he games with and he\\'s always laughing and having a good time with them. I want something like that but I have no idea where to start. I have joined a couple of subreddits to specifically try to make friends, and it was to no avail. If anyone can give me insight or offer to be my friend that would be amazing.

We got to our hotel, and I was already a bit anxious because it was late and I don\\'t really like being away from my mom (sad, I know). So, we got to our hotel room and I realized that there wasn\\'t a shower cap and that I\\'d need to go to the front desk to get one. My dad had gone out for a walk so I was all alone. My overprotective parents made it so I get super anxious going places on my own without asking permission. But, after 10 minutes of nervous pacing, I decided to go. I was so proud of myself in that moment for overcoming a huge fear of mine and acting like the age that I am. Cue more anxiety from talking to strangers. I waited in line and was already shaking a bit. Then, I asked the employee if they had a shower cap. She said she\\'d check. She took a long time and the waiting made me even more anxious. She came back and said she couldn\\'t find one, but that she\\'d look in another room. She comes back and tells me there aren\\'t any, so I thank her and walk to the elevator. Now I\\'m feeling even worse because I feel bad for inconveniencing her for nothing. I step into the elevator and two women in their 30\\'s follow. I hate elevators; small spaces you can\\'t leave with complete strangers. I try my best to look like I\\'m not on the verge of a panic attack, but I suppose I didn\\'t look as natural as I thought I did. The women stifle laughing and looking at each other. Of course, my first thought is \"Oh God they\\'re laughing at me because I\\'m such an idiot.\" And then I remember reading something that said that people aren\\'t paying attention to you and are more worried about themselves (we\\'ve all heard this, right?). So I chose to believe that as best I could. Healthy thoughts! No, nope, no. As I walk out of the elevator and turn the corner I hear them burst out laughing. \"Oh my God did you see that little girl? She looked so scared!!\" \"That\\'s the funniest thing I\\'ve seen all day!\" There\\'s no doubt that they\\'re talking about me. Right then, I burst out crying and quickly walk to my room, wanting to lay down and cry. Well of course that can\\'t be the end to this terrible 20 minutes, because my room key won\\'t work. Now, I\\'m standing in a hallway crying, waiting for my dad to come back to open the door. A few people walking by give me weird looks. Eventually, my dad comes back and I go to the bathroom to cry and have a panic attack for the next hour. I didn\\'t really enjoy the rest of my trip because of this, unfortunately. Well, guess who\\'s never getting confident and facing their anxiety again. I don\\'t know why I thought I could do anything social without fucking it up majorly.

I spend a lot of time alone just making beats and playing guitar (I’m not very good but it’s gets my mind out of negative places) sometimes I’ll jam with some friends of mine I’ve made through music and the anxiety sort of goes away because we have a common ground with each other. Painting and listening to music or podcasts is also a nice thing. Just an idea. If there’s something you like to do or that you have a nack for whether it’s an art or a sport I’d just lock in on that and focus on your own abilities and not worry about what other people think. The world is harsh and people suck. I’m still learning that to this day, it seems like you have a rough home life and it’s keeping you from getting out there. I wish I knew what I could say to help you with that. Maybe get a gym membership? Basketball can be fun. Regardless I hope it gets better for you OP and you aren’t alone in this.

            "{'sequence': '(\\' Hey there! I used to be in a similiar spot. I hated myself through my teenage years and couldn\\'t understand how anyone could want to be friends with me, let alone date me. I was pretty lucky to still have friends at that time because my social anxiety was at its peak back then and I could barely sociliaze without having a breakdown. Since then a lot of things happened that led me to change how I treat myself. One very important discovery was this: The reason I was so afraid of people not liking me was because I hated myself. That simple. It didn\\'t have anything to do with how they treated me but with the way I saw myself. I was scared of them seeing past my \"facade\" and finding out what kind of \"horrible person\" I was inside. The second discovery I made was how harshly I treated myself. Whenever I made a tiny mistake I wanted to hit myself and a wave of demeaning thoughts overcame me. I then started to slowly distance myself from this default \"punishment system\" in my head and asked myself: \"Okay, I just did that and feel horrible about it. How would I treat a friend if they did eaxctly that? Would I hate them? Want to hit them?\" Of course I didn\\'t. Be your own friend. Try to look rationally at your actions instead of letting your anxiety be the judge. After a time of looking more rationally at my actions and treating me like \"a friend\" I also started to doubt that I was that \"horrible person\". Those mistakes weren\\'t real ones, just doorways for my anxiety to bust in and kick me down. People didn\\'t like my \"facade\" because I didn\\'t have one. They liked me for who I was and I could finally accept the signs of their affection, be it messages, smiles, hugs, compliments, showing interest etc. The next step was looking at \"real mistakes\", moments where I was truely in the wrong. I learned to face those errors and stand up for it. Yes, I did something wrong and I knew it was bad. Everyone makes mistakes, **everyone.** I won\\'t try to justify my behavior. And then I let it go. There is no point in hating yourself for the rest of your life because of it. Don\\'t deny it, but also don\\'t drag it along with you. The past is in the past and all you can do is learn from it. Get better so you won\\'t repeat those mistakes. Being confident can be scary. I always pictured it like climbing up a ladder. If you stand at the bottom, nothing can easily hurt you, but it\\'s also dark and cold down there. If you start climbing up, there is a chance that people will come by and try to shake the ladder, or you loose your balance and maybe you\\'ll even fall down. But up on that ladder the view is much better than at the bottom. Maybe you\\'ll be able to reach the branches of a fruit tree, see a path that leads to your destination or just enjoy the sunshine on your face (alright enough with the metaphors). Not hating yourself and having self-confidence also gives you the ability to reflect on other people\\'s behavior towards you. When I still believed that I was not worth of anyone\\'s affection I took people\\'s mean behavior towards me as proof. I thought that people who treated me badly were in the right. I automatically assumed everyone around me didn\\'t like me because why would they? It was like I had to first prove myself to earn people\\'s affection. Now that I don\\'t hate myself anymore I have a totally different view. People treating me badly doesn\\'t mean I deserve it. It can be justified but not necessarily. And if it\\'s not justified then I have the right to defend myself. I don\\'t adopt their view of me as fact or as my personal opinion of myself. No matter what you do, there will always be people who don\\'t like you, no matter what you do. So why concentrate on that when you can instead focus on those people that accept and love you for who you are? \\')', 'labels': ['not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect', 'related to an outdoor space with negative effect'], 'scores': [0.7456661462783813, 0.1019405648112297, 0.09950593113899231, 0.05288738012313843]}\n",

            "{'sequence': \"('I really get you. When I was your age( I am currently 17) I had the same problems. And the problem is that I was ok with it. At least I don’t think that anybody noticed that I was struggling. Everybody I knew were thinking that I wanted to be that shy guy who never actually expresses his own opinion or takes part in conversations, the problem was that I did not wanted to be that guy in the first place. I remember the times when I was coming back to school expecting to become better( being somebody who people enjoy spending time and being friend with). As you can guess, I did not. When the time to say something or actually communicate with other people came, all those desires disappear due to my social anxiety. To overcome it I started finding some mutual interests with my classmates in order to integrate myself into their group. Nevertheless, I was able to find likeminded people and even 1 friend in the group which the rest of the class considered geeks or nerds who were interested in games, programming, computers, movies and 1 person who ultimately became my close friend in self improvement. I chose this group because the other part of the class was either interest in almost nothing or only cloth, drinking, partying and everything related to that, I just did not see myself as part of that group. The problem is that what worked for me, will not necessarily work for you as I don’t know how actually big your problem is. But I will give you some universal tips. 1. First handle problems that you can actually handle by yourself( like your math problems). 2. Secondly, I would recommend you to go into Self-Improvement topic as it was the beginning for me and I accomplished so much since then. 3. People won’t talk to you unless you talk to them( in my case at least) so you need to take action first if you want people to notice you and your improvements. 4. Don’t let your previous believes and assumptions hold you back. Understand what is real and what is just in your head. “Reality, even when you stop believing in it, doesn’t go away”. 5. Don’t be obsessed with what other people think( easier sad that done). You just have to get there somehow. Try figuring it out by yourself. 6. Understand when the problem is in you and when it’s white other people. When somebody treats you bad and offends you. The problem is not you. 7. Don’t sacrifice your ideals and life principles. Do not go against your own nature to please someone to feel loved, cared or appreciated . If you feel that way, it does not meant that it is true. (By this I don’t mean not to go out of your comfort zone but not to do or say what you know in your bones is wrong. 8. Human relations ships and friendships are complicated. Don’t blame yourself when you somehow mess something up, remember to stay clear minded and don’t blame yourself to much, learn from your mistakes and move forward, 9. When friendships survives crisis, it gets stronger. 10. You can’t learn social skills overnight, it is a constant proses of self development and learning to live through and solve your own crisis moments and problems. Much luck with your math, school and try to spend your school days the way that you will not regret during your graduation day. And remember - it is okay when you are different, try to find something positive about it and move on. The important think is to stay up to your ideals and constantly find ways to make yourself and your future better. As I promise you, in a couple of years you will be remembering these times or with smile, or with nostalgia, or with regrets but at the same time you will remember that past is past but the future that is waiting for you is still there, and it is brighter than ever.

If I believed everyone thought I was a fish my anxiety levels would go through the roof as even tho I know I’m not a fish, them thinking that would obviously have negative consequences for me (maybe I’ll worry someone tries to catch me and eat me ahaha). Its the same with people thinking you are a psychopath, even if you don’t believe it the world suddenly seems a lot more hostile towards you and in turn you become more anxious. I think often people with SA see the world as much more hostile towards them than it really is because of how the perceive people view them (even when they don’t believe it themselves). Does my argument make sense? SA is affected by not only how you see yourself but also how you perceive others see you (although I agree they are usually linked). It’s important because discovering your perception of how people see you may be more negative than reality (which I think is often the case with SA) is a good way of making the outside world seem less hostile and reducing anxiety.

You should be proud of yourself already. I was pretty much the same as you at 16 and still have those problems at 21 but I am begining to change for the better. One thing you can do is to think of conquering SA like training a muscle. Meeting strangers and talking to girls are outside of your comfort zone. But everytime you venture outside it and allow yourself to sit with the feelings and thoughts, your comfort zone grows and your distress zone shrinks. Think of it like a bicep. If your bicep starts small and weak and has a lot of excess fat around it. Over time through many bicep curls and training it to its limits and beyond it begins to grow and become stronger, and the excess around it goes away as well. Now its not healthy to have everything be within your comfort zone, our bodies need some fat, distress is sometimes a good thing , but not when it interferes with our lives in a negative way. So be aware of how you feel in stressful situations and gradually train yourself to cope with them and grow your comfort zone by mindfully pushing yourself out of it gradually. Start by saying \"Hi\" and go from there. I spent ALL of highschool and yrs11 and 12 avoiding girls I liked or that liked me as well as not opening up to friends to build deeper connections. Not because I wanted to avoid them but just because it seemed to happen by itself. It caused me great despair and I would never wish it upon anyone else. I wish you well.

Taking only pills will not help you in the long run, but combined with self CBT or trying to change some of your thinking patterns will help you a lot. Pills will motivate you to change, to be more outgoing person. So I strongly advise to try it.

While a confident and lively child is also that way from the very first day. (All of this also holds true for the time before they start going to school) Siblings who are a year or two apart in age or even twins can have completely opposite personalities.

I had basketball at around your age as an outlet that in hindsight I believe really helped prevent my social anxiety from coming out too strong. As that I stop playing the sport my anxiety grew so bad that I wasn't really the same until recently (now 22). I would recommend working out. Now I know this doesn't address the immediate problem which I'll address in a second but I think it's worth a shot. I believe I was accepted more in social situation given my physique and other dumb things that people in society look up to. Not only that but I've read some studies that working out actually reduces anxiety. Now it's not going to completely get rid of it but it might help. Now for actually addressing the anxiety head on this is gonna be a little tricky given your age. People in HS think its the end all be all but you'll realize once your my age it doesn't mean shit and you'll never see 99.9% of those people again. But nevertheless my answer is this, you are going to have to put yourself out there. Socialization is a skill, and like anything else you are going to have to work on it probably a lot. Just think about it through an RPG context for example, you're starting out at level one. And you are going to remain there until you start grinding (working on socializing). I've been through a lot in terms of my levels of anxiety. To almost having a panic attack in the middle of a relatively empty Trader Joe's to serving a section of 20 people and not feel my anxiety spring up. And the only reason I was able to do that is because I put myself out there. Now I had a help of a friend and we had similar problems and went out to Cali and pretty much went out every night which helped speed up the process which would be a similar recommendation I would give you but you're still a kid. But anyway the point is this, put yourself out there, maybe workout to help with anxiety and confidence, don't give af about what ANYBODY in HS thinks because you are never going to see them again once you hit my age, and don't get discourage. You WILL fail but that's okay. No matter what skill you are crafting you are bound to fail at some point and there is nothing wrong with that.

So by this point, I'm just suffering and want to feel connected but I'm so disconnected I have no idea how to be connected to society. It's tough, and I understand your pain. However, it seems you have clinical depression. I think this is a do brainer (sorry) but that's the thing with depression, you just live with it. I'm asking the same thing in llife, for someone to be there to end my loneliness. It's just that no one wants to be around someone who is unattractive and horrible at human interaction, even if I'm healthy. So rejection is my forte, I've been rejected so many times I practically can sense when, how and why it will happen (that isn't something to be proud of). A lot of times I'm void of happiness, my depression has made me numb to understanding any feelings or emotions, and I have a hard time reading people's emotions which just adds to my problems.

That was the worst decision of my life, attempting suicide. All it did was make my pain become worse, and it didn't solve any of the issues I was going through.

This can help you get an understanding of what other people see when you talk, and also acclimate you to looking people in the eyes. One thing i like to do is to shift the rest of your body position without breaking eye contact. If you feel nervous, try switching to a different pose (leaning on one side, arms crossed | headtilt + hand on chin, ect), or even taking just a few seconds to close your eyes as you nod. You can also look to the side for a bit, if you're thinking of a response. I remember i used to struggle with this a lot too, and part of it is not knowing enough body language, or just keeping a straight face. It can be harder to look someone in the eyes if you're staying still and serious (hence why i move a lot and use different gestures and stuff) The other important thing is getting help woth depression.

I feel like sometimes I want to just be normal and socialize and not care, but then my brain would be like, “Nope, you’re not going anywhere. They’re going to judge you so better just stay in the corner and stay quiet.” But like, today, I was able to shut off that side of me and just chilled out. I felt like I was on a roll, talking to my co-workers and having a great conversation with them. I felt really relieved actually because for the past several weeks I’ve been here, I’ve never really talked much. But then the night came to an end and all of us were in the back. I was on my phone while all of them were just chilling, and my assistant manager asked me if I had a ride home tonight. My co-workers have actually been giving me rides home ‘cause they’re really nice and know I don’t have a car yet. I was like, “No, I’m gonna ride the Uber.” And he told me my other co-worker could give me a ride... or I think he did... I wasn’t sure. I overheard them talking about where my address was but I just felt like I didn’t need to bother someone to take me home, especially if someone else forced them to. So I did the shittiest thing ever and clocked out, said “Good night,” to the whole group, then passed by my co-worker who was asked by my manager to give me a ride. He seemed busy by the computer so I was too shy to talk to him and ask him about giving me a ride so I just headed out on my own and like... I felt really shitty! I felt like everyone, especially my manager, now thinks I’m freaking weird. I should’ve at least told him, “It’s okay, I could take an Uber so as to not bother anyone.” But I basically just ignored his kind offer and I’ve been feeling really bad about it for hours now.

Trying to date before learning to make friends is like trying to run before you've learnt to walk. Also, having friends often leads to dates.

You've got learn to play twinkle little star before you can learn Metallica. If you insist upon trying to date before you've gotten better at making friends my advice would be to avoid dating sites. If your experience is anything like mine, you'll just be ignored which is bad for your self-esteem and will just make you even more anxious. As terrifying as it is you have to approach women in real life. Even if you're a stuttering, sweating, awkward mess you will be far more likely to get a date by approaching a woman than by liking her on tinder. Here's a couple things that may help with your anxiety when approaching a woman. First off, most women are really, truly, extremely nice. The worst that is going to happen is she'll say no. Secondly, she's probably anxious too! Finally, make a habit if you haven't already of liking the way you look every time you leave your house. This will make you feel more confident when you do see a woman you like. Hope this helps. Good luck!

For my generation (18), we are constantly glued to the phones, we would rather stay in our rooms on our computers/tv than go outside and socialise. The idea of natural casual conversation has completely disappeared and now only exists where alcohol and pick-ups coincide (clubs, bars). Its like we are losing the ability to just sit and fucking chat for a while, without a drug to reduce our fear and without a specific agenda in mind (sex). Your thread on r/seduction is really interesting to me because a few women said that they would prefer if men didnt do this.

Honestly if you\\'re not doing those things it\\'s a lot easier to think that you are totally hopeless and doomed. But there are worse conditions you can have I guess, and it\\'s always good to have insight and awareness that something\\'s wrong. And in therapy you\\'ll learn all of the things that you can do to deal with this. Social anxiety disorder can be managed, but social anxiety itself will never go away, ever. It helps to remember that even very outgoing, normal, successful people experience social anxiety. We are social creatures, so I believe that we evolved some social anxiety in order to ensure our survival. People who are conscious about how they contribute to the group will want to cooperate and not do things that hurt others. More cooperation means that the group can survive yknow? So it\\'s there to keep you considerate of others in a way. It\\'s weirder to *not* feel any fear about how you come across to others. Everyone has experience feeling weird about walking into class late, or being afraid that they\\'ll say something lame, etc. The difference is that people without SAD know how to think about their fear in a productive way. They catch irrational thoughts, take risks, and don\\'t make a habit of avoiding things just because they\\'re scared. Of course they might skip an awkward party or dwell on something embarrassing, but that once-in-a-while type of thing is more desirable than an anxiety that takes over your life so badly that you can\\'t leave the house. I like to believe that getting to a little below \"normal\" level is reasonably achieveable for most people (espec if your only mental health issue is SAD). There are lots of resources and programs for the worst case scenario too, depending on your country.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'I\\'m going to run the risk of sounding dismissive, and suggest looking into seeing a good therapist who specializes in social anxiety. I don\\'t say this to pass you off to someone else (feel like I should say this bc it\\'s something I\\'d worry about, tbh), but because I think the long-term support could make a world of difference. After the peak of my social anxiety, when I was going back out into public and had to face how terrifying it all was, getting that support and direction on a weekly basis really really helped. My therapist got to know me, learning what was scariest and what I was motivated by, and set tasks that were difficult but ultimately achievable. He got me from only leaving my home to attend college classes to a point where I was: speaking up when ordering at coffee shops, not panicking over grocery shopping, reaching out to greet new classmates, no longer cowering every time someone noticed me in public, etc. I had to move away after awhile, but I still credit him with getting me far enough along that I can guide myself now using the tools he taught me. 100% would recommend hunting down a good therapist. However, if you don\\'t have the time/money for that, here\\'s my top suggestions: 1. Practice mindfulness. Be aware of your behavior, and make a running list of what you did/how it negatively affected you. Later on, look back at the negative thoughts/actions and find something new you can do instead. You\\'re aiming to recognize that behavior now so you can gently correct it *as it happens*. (Bonus tip: always replace with a new action/thought instead of just stopping something cold turkey. Bad always needs a good to take its place.) Examples of actions and replacements: Beating myself up over a choice   Acknowledge that it happened instead of fighting it, and encourage myself with ways I can improve. Telling myself \"I\\'ll look foolish if I ask a question\"   Firmly remind myself \"I am going to ask this question today\", and instead focus on how I can word that question clearly so that it\\'s easier for them to understand me (satisfies my need to people-please, thereby letting me focus more on actually asking the question). 2. Set tasks that require effort, but are achievable with practice. A personal example comes from my therapist, who knew that I struggled to shop alone in grocery stores because the big crowds and one-on-one interaction with a cashier made me nervous. He knew I loved caffeine, and that my aunt (who drove me to my appointments) was buying me coffee every week. My task was to tell her \"thank you but no\", and then buy it myself at a small coffeeshop near his office. This was difficult because I was alone and had to speak to a cashier, but achievable because I was motivated by the desire for coffee and could use the small, empty coffeeshop as practice for bigger, busier stores. Basically, look for your scariest end goal (like walking up to a higher ranked physician in another department and directly asking your question), and keep stepping it down until it meets that \"scary but doable\" mark. Maybe that means making notes about them so you can remember personal information and feel more confident during small talk, leading to more familiarity overall. Or maybe it means asking smaller questions to more familiar people more often, so that questions in general are less daunting. This post got SUPER long, but I hope it was in some way helpful. And you are more than welcome to chat with me anytime about anything. I am sometimes slow to respond and kind of awkward with wording (I don\\'t sleep much), but I\\'ll always listen. :)\\')', 'labels': ['not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'related to an outdoor space with negative effect', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect'], 'scores': [0.9402420520782471, 0.023216428235173225, 0.020486731082201004, 0.016054848209023476]}\n",

I was too afraid to play multiplayer games with no voice with random people online. Yes I could not see or hear a physical person and yet I was too scared to play with them. I had to play everything in single player. And as for social media I didn't do it. Me going onto a subreddit and type out a reply to someone else was impossible. My anxiety would be so bad I'd start crying. I was 19 when I first started using social media. I first used Twitter at age 20. You're not expected to figure everything out at your age. Heck if you have managed your social anxiety at a young age then bravo your in that 5% of people who did it. Don't feel bad. No matter how bad you have it it can get better. It all comes it steps. One thing I can say is get yourself out there. For me was college/university. Age 18 is when I finally started being social and exploring outside of this mental bubble I had. Was I afraid heck yeah. I wanted to go home and cry but I got through it. The best way to manage this is exposing yourself to social events and going out in public. Its going to suck, but after you do it you'll feel great because you did it. That is confidence. No one is born with confidence. You have to build it up. Like leveling a pokemon or stat in a video game. The more you do it the better it becomes. Eventually you'll gain enough confidence that you'll do things without even thinking. Yes you'll still feel anxious, you'll get that heavy feeling in your chest, but you won't even consider running away nor crying. You'll be anxious but you'll be too determined to do it that social anxiety becomes something that's just running in the background that you don't even notice lol.

I’ve gotten to the point with therapy and trying to be more forgiving to myself that I can usually laugh stuff like this off, but this time around it is a little more difficult. I recently started an online game with some internet friends, most of whom I’ve only recently met, that used discord and other programs. I always use push to talk, I get very anxious in silence so I make a lot of small noises but I want to be considerate of others. Most of my noises are things like loud typing or tapping, humming, sometimes I’ll say a thought out loud or chuckle to myself if I think of something funny. We played earlier tonight and connection was a little wonky, others were complaining of background noise. I checked my mic, I was on PTT so I thought I was good. Nope. One of the other programs *also* had a built in mic that I didn’t know about and which was not muted. I didn’t discover this until a several minutes in. They others had to sit through several minutes of my humming, tapping and whispering thoughts aloud to myself, and were too polite to directly ask me to check my mic again. We played the rest of the game and had a great time, no one said anything at any point, but in the back of my mind I wanted to die of embarrassment the whole time. I appreciate that no one said anything, but that hasn’t stopped my anxiety from fixating on how weird or annoying they must think I am. I’m the newest player in this group, so I’m already self-conscious about the fact that they have to help me more often than anyone else in the group. I’ve run through my usual routine to talk myself out of the anxiety, but it’s not working. I can’t convince myself that they will forget it by next session, even though I know most people don’t care to remember that type of stuff. These players seem like good people and I don’t think they’d judge me that harshly over something this small, but also anxiety. My husband has tried to talk me through it, and while it did help a little, it’s still bad enough that I can’t fall asleep. I know everyone leaves their mic on and does something like this every so often, but I just can’t shake my fear that they won’t want me in the group anymore because I’ve now revealed myself as ‘the weird one’. Now it’s 2:40 AM and I just want to sleep but I keep getting anxiety flashes that keep me awake. Typing this out did help, but I’m still to anxious to sleep.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'Social Anxiety: The Essentials Part 2. **\\\\*See the 1st Part I made** [**here**](The Group Project / Presentation Almost a cliche for nervousness, the school, or work presentation is truly an instrument of social anxiety torture. I don\\'t care whatever \"benefits\" they may try to push like team building or collaboration. I\\'ve never felt anything after a presentation was over other than a MASSIVE psychological sigh of relief. Working with a group used to be hard for me. In school, reading syllabus/hearing about upcoming projects (and therefore presentation) always inspired complete overwhelming panic. Firstly, when you are shy or anxious, forcing kids to team up already puts you at a huge disadvantage. You are going to be that quiet kid, at the end of everyone moving desks, who has to respond to (if you\\'re lucky enough for the teacher to ask) \"who doesn\\'t have a group?\" Then you get tacked on to the group of friends (who all know each other) and spend most of the time talking about plans after school, gossiping about people, or what pussy they slammed last night rather than talking about the project. As if all the forced interactions throughout a school day didn\\'t already stress you out enough. In college, this became less of a problem. The group selection was usually random, and a large percentage of the class are all solo kids who don\\'t know anyone. So you all enter the process on an even playing field. And often you could discuss the project and not waste time because everyone just wants to get it over with and go home. Working in the group itself can be interesting because sometimes I became the leader, mainly because everyone else had so much else going on they didn\\'t want to really engage a lot. Other times a really controlling loud mouth girl would make all the choices (you know who you are). Ultimately, outside a few awkward meetings with kids outside of class, most of the time it went smoothly because your all in the same boat just trying to get a grade and get out. The most significant part of the anxiety comes from the anticipation and execution of the presentation itself. SO many thoughts swirl in the background of your mind: \"I\\'m going to look so unprepared, I\\'m going to feel embarrassed and everyone will notice, I will stumble and look and feel stupid\". And you get so nervous as each group goes up you feel your heart could explode from the stress. Your leg shaking, sweating, using every ounce of energy to not collapse or run right out of there. This is not the usual nerves, this is your mind detecting a false threat and activating stress hormones forcing you into a panicked state of survival. I\\'ve had mixed results over time. Sometimes I am complete sweat flop and red and shaking. Other times I hold my composure and perform ok. Regardless of the outcome, the process I described before is always the same (total fear). Id like to think one day that I can feel semi-comfortable with presentations. I haven\\'t had to do one in a long while so I haven\\'t had to test it. I remember feeling really nervous and speaking shakey (voice cracking) during a dept wide meeting crammed into a little tiny conference room. All the bosses and their directors were starring at me when I spoke. The room was so small. So maybe I\\'m in no position to give advice on this. But... Advice: If you\\'re going to present, fill out a lot of information on the PowerPoint presentation/slideshow and read off it. Yes, I know the rules say sometimes (DO NOT READ OFF SLIDES). But If you do good job an answer all the questions and cover the main point of the project then who really cares? You may get docked 10 points or even get no points off at all. It helped a lot if I stared down at the computer screen as well and looked up maybe once or twice the entire time (blocking out the audience). It looks a lot more natural then you think. Be prepared with knowledge, that is your weapon to survive. Sometimes the anxiety overwhelms you, it has happened to me. Just gotta power through them the best you can and know nobody who\\'s watching cares at all. Just like how when you watch other groups the only thing on your mind is your project. Another cliche tip: actually practice what you\\'re going to say. Readout loud your slide show, several times each day. By the time you actually have to do it, it feels more comfortable because you know what you sound like saying it. This way you can control speed and tone better. People without anxiety (professors) don\\'t understand how scary these things are for us. Seriously, it\\'s as if you\\'re entering a dangerous situation and your mind is screaming at your body to run. I\\'m not pretending that I ever will (or want to) be a great public speaker. But my advice is for survival! If your going through a presentation or group project right now and have social anxiety, I seriously feel your pain and aren\\'t alone. Its hell, I\\'ve been tormented by them for over a decade. Depending on your career choice you may never have to do them again! (or at least to much smaller audiences)  and#x200B; Freinds / Freind Groups This is a hot topic and often the main point of anxiety for many. The anxiety, I feel, comes from feelings of inadequacy or failure. We see people around us hoarding friends like money, tons and tons of friends, communicating, traveling, talking! And you look at yourself and think \"I don\\'t or can\\'t have that and therefore I am not successful and failed socially. I\\'ve fallen into that mind trap before and have felt badly or low about my limited social life. But my situation is unique in the fact that I slowly absorbed into my brother\\'s friend group. My brother had random friends over the house since he was really young. And over time formed a group that I was always kinda in / around. So while I still was super shy, super awkward, and had all my social anxiety quirks, I still could participate in capacity with friends. I often got backlash from my sister and mother who would say \"they are your brother\\'s friends, why don\\'t you have your own friends\". That often made me feel sad and alone and threatened. Today, we are all still friends and are going through all the adult pains of moving away, career, no time for fun/hangouts, ect.. The good news for those not in that unique situation, is I have since made friends outside of the group. I met two others that I connected with through apps/online. I think its easier this way because I\\'m not the type to strike up a conversation with random people and really avoid eye contact with strangers. And talking online and connecting first is nice because you get to know them and see if there is compatibility. Meeting in person for the first time can be INSANELY uncomfortable and awkward. That can be really stressful because you built an online persona for them, and you go in with expectations and you can leave disappointed when they don\\'t seem to act the way you thought they would. They have those expectations for you too. So it\\'s a lot of stress and baggage you bring to the meetup. Just try and leave that baggage at home and not have any expectations. Sometimes speaking on the phone before the meeting can break down a lot of fears and get it out of the way. Even calling as you pull up and ask \"Hey, where are you\". (yea I know, see my first post on phone use). Just don\\'t expect anything to happen and try and be flexible to everything that comes. Advice: Before you do anything, you must first do one thing. DESTROY the idea that having a lot of friends means your a happy and successful because thats bullshit. We are all different and require different levels of solicitation. For me, I would love to just have really close best friend. If your looking for freinds or even dates, talking to people online can be a way to get to know people. For me, it was dating/hook up apps. It took me a LONG time to find legit people I connected with. You\\'re going to have to weed through 1000s (not joking) of people to find the one or two gems. People that are complete assholes, that don\\'t want the same things as you, or people that are flat as a board personality-wise. It may make you feel terrible because so much time and energy goes into. You may have to reject people, people will definitely reject you. It can really start to affect your self-worth when it feels like your not making friends. Trust me, keep trying, and the navigation of the process teaches you a lot about yourself and socialization. I learned that you have to derive our self worth from within you, and not rely on the acceptance of other people to make you feel valuable. It was a lesson hard learned! People you take the leap of faith in meeting in person may ghost you afterward. They will say your not confident enough, or \"you are not like how you were online\". Just take those hits, and pick up where you left off. It builds a tougher skin over time. Building yourself up after getting knocked down so you are ready for the moment you connect with the gem of a person and really get along. Another point I want to make. I used to have the tendency to put myself down a lot talking to people. I was really insecure about many things, and my self-defense mechanism was to put myself down before the others would. DONT do this and actively avoid it. People pick up on it and can easily get turned away. You\\'re sending out a false image of yourself and killing the opportunity to connect by saying bad things about yourself and how your not good enough. It becomes super obvious to me now when other people do it, just how insecure they are and how afraid they are of being rejected by me. So like I said in my last post, be kind to yourself internally AND externally through your words.\\')', 'labels': ['not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'related to an outdoor space with negative effect'], 'scores': [0.3420993685722351, 0.22574125230312347, 0.22562332451343536, 0.20653606951236725]}\n",

I (20F) have social anxiety, I have no friends, let alone had a boyfriend and my sister (17) has everything I never had. In February she started dating this guy (17 also) and he lives like an hour away from my house (I moved back in with my parents, brother and sister from university when this covid thing happened). Because he lives kind of far away, he sleeps here for a couple of nights and then my sister sleeps there for a couple of nights too. Usually, my sister slept on the couch and he would sleep in her room and in the morning she would go back in her room. The firsts couple of times he slept over, I would hear her in the middle of the night get up and go to her room (my parents didn’t know she was doing that) and when doing that, she would wake me by walking past my room and I had a hard time falling back asleep. That happened about five times before I decided to talk to her about it. When I was talking to her, I felt like she was scared that I would tell our parents, which I didn’t, but she asked my mom to talk to me about it because she didn’t understand what was waking me up. She told our mom that I was probably waking up at midnight when she would go from her room to the couch. Because she decided to go to our mom about that, I told her (our mom) that it was at 3 or 4 in the morning and sometimes I couldn’t even fall back asleep. So after my mom had all the information, I guess she talked to my sister because for like a month after that she would always stay on the couch until at least 8 in the morning. But the last time he was here, they slept in her bed all night, together, for the two nights he was here. I don’t think my parents know. I know she’s 17 and her boyfriend is really sweet, but it makes me soooo uncomfortable. I even had trouble sleeping at night during those two nights because I knew they were sleeping in the same bed, in the room next to me. Today, I went into her room to get something (I had her permission) and I saw that she started taking birth control. That made me even more uncomfortable. I just kept replaying the sounds I heard in the middle of the night like the bed moving and things like that as making up scenarios... So what I want to know is: should I tell my mom that it makes me uncomfortable when they sleep in the same bed? I don’t know if my mom and my sister talked and my mom told her it was ok for them to sleep in the same bed and I don’t want to make things awkward. Honestly, I don’t think I would have talk to my mom about it if my sister hadn’t talk to her in the first place.. The main reason it makes me uncomfortable is because I never had a boyfriend and I always thought I should be an example for my siblings because I am the oldest, but clearly I failed at that because my sister has her life way more figured out than me.

What would you do if it made you that uncomfortable?')\", 'labels': ['not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect', 'related to an outdoor space with negative effect'], 'scores': [0.9023952484130859, 0.03700976073741913, 0.03322376310825348, 0.027371251955628395]}\n",

I\\'ve always dealt with SAD since I was a kid. And I had a parent who would humiliate me and criticize me constantly so I\\'m pretty sure that caused it to made it a lot worse. I had to cut off this parent when I was old enough. It was rough for a long time. And other family members guilt trip me constantly about it and it\\'s made it hard for me to set boundaries with friends. I never want to do something to get a negative reaction or upset someone...and I think it makes me attract some pretty self-centric folks. I think this because my parent never made any effort, so when people make an effort to hand with me (especially since its so hard for me to make new friends or be myself around ppl bc of anxiety) it means the world to me. I am very loyal and I try to give ppl the benefit of the doubt, but in the past its always blown up on me. I\\'ve always balanced out friendships with very extroverted people. I think I am attracted to that energy bc it helps pull me out of my head and get exposed to the opposite energy. I do want to go out and have something motivating me to practice facing my fears. In that past this has helped me rewire my brain a bit. Especially in college and I had to give presentations and constantly be around a lot of people. Having someone close who takes that attention and enjoys it is probably something I could see other ppl with anxiety benefitting from. And obviously I cared and liked these ppl. I wasn\\'t picking them out bc of their extroversion...it was more something I noticed after the fact. Presently, 2 of these friendships have blown up or sizzled out. One of them kept cheating on her bf\\'s or dating cheaters...doing a lot of self-destructive things. And I was always the listener. I think I\\'m a pretty good listener probably, but this always becomes my \"role\" and I start noticing ppl only keeping me around for constant validation and when I can\\'t validate them doing something like cheating (bc it\\'s shitty) it goes really badly.

Think about what your next step should be after you have dealt with the obvious emotional baggage that is created following a breakup from such a longterm relationship. Another thing: before you let someone love you, you need to love yourself. It seems to me that you relied on him too much (I hope this does not sound harsh; totally not my intention), and now don\\'t know what to do. Remember that relationships are not a MUST. Don\\'t feel like you need someone, or need to be with someone. Instead, for now try to work on your emotional state and stability. Join a yoga class, start running, anything to let out some of the pent up anxiety and frustration. Painting is a beautiful way (I find) to express your emotions.

So I did nothing. Then during my last year of school due to the lack of any social life and stuff I decided I had to do at least something meaningful in my life (playing games, programming and watching minute physics all day didn\\'t satisfy anymore, it didn\\'t serve any purpose). Then I started running, every day in the evening though the fields, where no one could see and bother me. I think I started with 1km, really slow, and I truly hate running. And i was really bad at it. But at least at the end of the Day I had the feeling that I\\'d done at least one thing that served a purpose on that day. I got better at it, started running longer rounds and faster, I used one of these running tracking apps, they motivate A LOT! Even started to enjoy it sometimes a bit. At the same time I started running I cut back my food intake (in retrospective I ate way too less then I should have). Both these things where just hard on a physical level - I was a) hungry and b) running is hard work. BUT you\\'re not working against your fears in that case, so it\\'s doable! Fast forward some months later, I was still going on a run every day, and I partially hated it. But I got better, I lost weight, and for the first time in my life I ran 5km. Thinking \"wow, I\\'ve never archived that in my life before\" was a very good, receiving and rewarding thought. Same for 6,7,8,9 and 10km. Almost a year later, I was down 30kg at my target. Still had all my other anxieties and shit, but my weight wasn\\'t one anymore. Since I started college after that I thought \"why not join a gym, I want to build up muscles\" and from there on I went at least 3 times / day, and I love it!

I can say it is not as severe as having to drop out of school but it was pretty close to it. A few things I can tell you: 1) Mindfulness. Something I SHOULD practice more of.. but mindfulness is a form of meditation to help bring your mind out of the constant state of thinking (i.e. about if others are judging me) and brings you to a complete focused state. Look up mindfulness audio sessions or something like that on google, there is plenty of tutorials and things to help. 2) \"Don\\'t break the chain\" ..its something the famous comedian Jerry Sienfeld talked about. This is a comedian who has done so many stand up routines that it seemed so unlikely he was able to write that many jokes! How does he do so many one hour specials?! He mentioned it was something he calls \"dont break the chain,\" or in other words he would write a joke every single day, good or not, but do so EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. The reason I say this is because you should find something to work on every single day, no matter what! I myself joined a gym about a year and a half ago.. it was not because I wanted to lose weight (though that was on my mind as well) but because I needed some constant factor in my life that I would put forth effort each day to complete, something I HAD to do, to keep my mind on it.. You should find something to do, even if it\\'s just drawing a small picture or running a mile.. do it EVERY DAY! And if for whatever reason you can\\'t.. just do it the next day! In all of my years in dealing with social anxiety (and a negative family putting me down) I realize that the anxiety stems mostly from overthinking. Is that person looking at me from their car as I walk down the street? Am I worthless because I don\\'t have a job? Is what I\\'m wearing okay? etc. the list is endless. For me, social anxiety has stopped me from my potential being fully realized. It has stopped me from having a healthy relationship with pretty much any woman. It has stopped me from going out on the few beautiful days I see here.. I still have it, but not as bad. I practice a few things every day and you eventually reach a point of self confidence. You will know when you start to get comfortable with yourself and you start having thoughts like \"who gives a shit what they think! This is what I\\'M doing for me!\" One last note: I currently live in an area where cannabis is legal for recreational use. I started smoking not for my social anxiety itself but the fact that many other people here seemed to do it. I started smoking to make friends but now I keep smoking because it does make me feel good and content with the world around me.

I’ve always knew that I was insecure. Ever since I was a kid, I had problems with certain body parts that I deemed as “imperfect.” But, it got worse over the years. When I turned 9, I started covering my face with my hair because I felt better if I wasn’t exposing too much of my face When I was 10, I started developing social anxiety and started wearing baggier clothing, I also started looking in the mirror for hours a day. When I turned 11, I started covering my face more than ever before, I’d only wear certain types of clothing that I thought were “less revealing,” my anxiety started to become worse than it’d ever been before and got pulled out of school for it. When I was 12, I started noticing changes in my appearance from hour to hour, or day to day, these changes were usually in my face. Everyday, I’d wake up and think to myself, “okay, am I gonna be pretty or ugly today?” I don’t really know what the real me looks like anymore, sometimes I barley recognize my own reflection. Sometimes I stare in the mirror for hours a day, just pointing out flaws or changes. Sometimes I avoid looking in the mirror all together. Most of the time I don’t even see myself as a human, or too ugly to even be a human. I’ve had thoughts of performing surgery on myself and imagining how perfect I’d be if I done it, but I try not to think about it. Everyday, I watch videos about plastic surgery. Somehow, I feel like all of my problems would be gone if I just changed some of my facial features, like I’d be able to live an actual life. I’d pay any price for it, I don’t care if it could kill me, I’d do it. When I used to go to school, I’d carry out certain ways of getting ready. I’d mainly go to school on days where I felt like I looked like an actual human, most of the times I’d just cry in front of a mirror saying to myself “you’re disgusting.” It’s gotten easier since I’ve stopped going to school, but it still bothers me a lot. Minor inconveniences like catching a person staring at me, or wind blowing in my face and blowing my hair away from it would ruin my day. At lunch and break, I’d sit in a bathroom stall looking at my face, most of the time, I’d look at it and wouldn’t wanna come out, then have to get sent home by teachers because I was too afraid to go into class.

My next appointment is next week, I’ve never talked to any of my doctors about me feeling disgusting, I’ve always just told them that I only feel anxious for no real reason. I think I might tell my doctor this week, maybe then I’ll actually begin to get better. I think most of the anxiety comes from me feeling incredibly ugly, so I think it’s best to work on that. Body dysmorphia is also a thing that people with social anxiety are more likely to have, so I guess it’s safe to say that it’s a possibility. I’m excited to talk to my doctor about this, because I feel like it might be the start of me actually beginning to feel happier again.

Just breaking that cycle by going for a short walk around the neighbourhood is a good idea.

These are trained professionals, not someone looking to make you into a fool. With some time you will start feeling more stable. Not better, but stable. Then you start trying to work on finding something you enjoy. Games, movies, music, dogs, reading, helping old ladies cross the street. It really doesnt matter what it is. Just find something that sucks less than the other things and keep doing it. Try and see if there is a way to help the social anxiety while doing that. If you like dogs, go to a dog park or a regular park and ask to pet someones dog. If its movies maybe try to go to a movie store or something and buy/rent/look at a movie. If its music go to a record store and look at what they have. Just something you can do that adds a social element to whatever it is you find you like. And keep pushing that boundary.

I've been really working hard on my social anxiety/awkwardness and loneliness since 2015, when I finally convinced my parents to let me go outside after so long time and I've been just exposing myself since then and I heavily improved myself alot that much without therapy/meds. I have little to none social anxiety online, in outside, in stores, etc that much today, but in college it's still pretty bad, it's nearly ending of second year and I still haven't really made any friends and I rarely speak unless really needed to do so and it's really difficult to study by yourself completely.

Start trying to build friendships with women first, don’t go into relationships thinking they will be romantic, that will take a lot of pressure off of you. Also, don’t refer to women as females as a start. Humanize us as much as possible, educate yourself about women issues, but remain a listener in those spaces.

But i\\'ve been typing this for too long to delete it all so sorry I\\'m not meaning to rub it in anyones face, I\\'m just sharing my experience  and#x200B; I\\'m 17 and have had 3 girlfriends technically but only really count one. In middle school was my first relationship with this girl named C. It started when I asked her to a dance (which was extremely nerve racking), and that was before my SA got too bad. It was a pretty standard relationship. We held hands and hung out. Then we broke up like 2 weeks later. Then at the end of 9th grade I started dating a girl named M. We kinda dropped hints that we liked each other but never did anything about it. A few weeks into summer I mustered up the courage and sent her a long heartfelt text about how I really liked her and whatnot. I wasn\\'t really asking her out, but just making my feelings clear. Then like a week later she asked me out and I said yes. I think we hung out once during our relationship then she dumped me about 2 weeks in with the classic \"It\\'s not you, it\\'s me\" excuse. Fast forward 3 years to the end of summer before 12th grade starts. This girl named D that I kinda knew from school replies to a photo of my dog on IG and we start talking. I really like skateboarding and post a lot of videos of me skating and she complemented me on those. I told her that I could teach her if she wanted and after a little convincing we decided to meet. Initially I was REALLY nervous about meeting her. When I offered to teach her how to skate, I was just being friendly in hopes I might make a new friend to skate with. However she dropped some hints that she liked me which instantly made me 100x more nervous to meet her. I made one of my friends come along because I know he\\'s goofy and would take attention off me if I needed. Anyways the meeting went well and D and I continued to talk and become more friendly. After awhile we both know that we like each other and are basically bf and gf. For some reason D had this idea that someone had to explicitly ask the other person out for it to be a couple. She told me she wanted me to ask her out and I said that it\\'s silly to ask someone to ask you out. If you both want to date each other and both know that you want to date each other, then you\\'re basically bf and gf, no need for someone to ask the other out. Anyways she then asks me out a few weeks later and so I guess that\\'s technically the started of our relationship, but it\\'s whatever. I think we dated for around 5 months. D was the first girl that I ever truly felt like I loved. I genuinely felt like I would do anything for her and that I wanted to be with her forever. Then what felt like out of nowhere, she tells me she\\'s not happy and wants me to do more for her. She wants me to know what she wants without her telling me. I tell her I\\'ll try my best and we continue dating. A week later she dumps me because she just doesn\\'t like me anymore. For a few days I was extremely depressed. I sit through school feeling numb, then I\\'d come home and lie in bed watching youtube until it was time to fall asleep. I was even somewhat suicidal at some point. She also got mad at me because one of her guy friends threatened to beat the shit out of me if I talked to her and I basically called him a retarded and messed with him a little. Apparently in her mind, me messing with her friend was worse than him threatening to beat me up and so she stopped talking to me as well. At that point I wasn\\'t as depressed but I was still sad. But about a day after she stopped talking to me I suddenly realized that I didn\\'t need her. After I realized that, I instantly became happier. I stopped caring about her and started caring about myself. I started skating more often and talking to friends. It\\'s been about a month since we broke up and I\\'m feeling better than ever. Just remember anons, you dont need a girl or boy to be happy. Do things that you enjoy, find a hobby, meet new friends. There\\'s so much to do in the world, don\\'t be down just because you haven\\'t met that special somone yet.\\')', 'labels': ['not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'related to an outdoor space with negative effect'], 'scores': [0.706443190574646, 0.11420442909002304, 0.11077576130628586, 0.06857658922672272]}\n",

Now, it\\'s probably due to wearing a mask like when I had sunglasses on during my summer jobs.. However, I still have general anxiety about being rushed to finish things and that\\'s making me feel horrible, exhausted, and so stressed out Highschool is when it all started, my social anxiety. Before then, I always been an introvert who barely talked, shy, and had nothing really to say. When I did speak, often times I had to repeat it since no one could hear me.. I\\'m just naturally soft spoken I guess. My two older siblings have anxiety too.. (sorry about how I am texting, I\\'m tired and having trouble putting this together). Uh, highschool took a toll on me and it was draining. Symptoms that I remember: erythrophobia, serve trembling, jerking, and shaking in my neck, head, hands, shoulders, and torso, feeling like I can\\'t speak because my voice would be all shakey, sweating excessively, overthinking, tearful eyes, and fast heartbeat.

            "{'sequence': \"('Sharing my experience of Social Anxiety for the first time.. Hi, before I begin talking about my social anxiety, I would just like to say that this is not my usual account, I created this because I feel that it would hinder my ability to properly express myself if I use my personal account. Sorry if this infringes on any of the rules, I am not totally familiar with them. You can take this down if you want or let me know and I will fix/take it down for you. Im 18 years old, male and I believe that I have some form of social anxiety and I want to share how it has so far affected my life. I recently started university in the UK and I am in a flat of 13 other people. My earliest memory, and I believe one of the causes of my social anxiety was Christmas day when I was about 6 or 7. My Uncle came to our house for the first time (he lived in another country) and he brought a camcorder. He filmed us opening our presents and I was so excited I always wanted to be on camera and see myself on the TV. When I heard my voice on the TV aged 6, I wanted it turned off immediately. I try never to speak on camera even now. I have usually found it really really hard to make new friends. If I make one, I latch on to him as much as possible and usually divert any conversations to them if someone I know tries to initiate a conversation with me. Im currently at 6 weeks into university and I haven’t made any friends, which is my fault because I don’t initiate any conversations and any conversations that I do have last around 6 seconds because I don’t know what to say to people. Its usually, goes “Hi, (insert name here)” - Other person “Hi (insert name here)” – Me “How are you?” – Other person “Good, you?” – Me “Im good” – Other person “That’s good” – Me (Awkward pause and I walk off to avoid further embarrassment) I promised myself that on the first day I moved in I would introduce myself to everyone but when I walked in, they said hi and I got really hot and flustered and couldn’t. I rarely leave my room, only to go to lectures and seminars (which I worry about hours beforehand) and I often go days without eating proper food because people are currently in the kitchen. At School it was a little bit of a benefit because while people would take time in their work to talk, I would out of awkwardness, concentrate fully on my work. Now at university, they suggest that you join or form a study group with your friends, which is hard because Im on the other side of the country and I have no friends here. I am really worried how I will communicate with others when we have to start giving group presentations and working in groups. We haven’t even been assigned one yet and it already takes up hours of worry in my mind. I am worried because I want to be successful at whatever it is that I am doing but I cant properly talk to people and I know that this will be a huge hindrance. I have never approached someone of the opposite gender and talked to them, I don’t know what to say. I only have one friend who is a girl and its more a friendship of association because she is my friends girlfriends. One of the feelings that I get when I am around people is a feeling of inferiority. I am 5 foot 5, which is small for a male, and have always been the smallest in my class. I have been mistaken for up to 6 years younger than I am and I think this is one of the causes of it. I cant just talk to someone for the sake of it I have to have a reason otherwise I would be wasting their time. If someone else initiates a conversation with one of my friends or vice versa I stand there really really awkwardly. I cant wait in queues with a whole bunch of people because I feel like I am holding them up. If I am waiting to go into a lecture, I wait towards the back of the group because I don’t want to add to their displeasure of waiting. Its almost as if, subconsciously, that my presence offends people. Not that I think that I am in any way important, quite opposite, I feel like a nobody. If there was anything important that I needed to ask someone about that I didn’t know from school, I would do it on facebook, and even then it would take a few hours to come up with what I saw as the right way to frame this. Even for this post, I have to keep reminding myself that it is anonymous. My parents don’t know how seriously it affects me. They think Im shy and often when I was younger they would get cross because I wouldn’t socially interact with other people for summer camps, for example. Anyway, the purpose of this post was to share my experience with social anxiety and at least get a little bit of the pressure off my chest. Having not talked so freely in my entire life it feels that I have had a little bit of word vomit.

And so began the slow and dreadful downhill spiral into complete nothingness. First I was just homeschooled. Then I lost all contact with supposed friends. Then the outside world completely. At this point I was still functional enough to mow the lawn and go to basic places like doctors, dentists, grocery stores, etc. Those eventually all stopped and I isolated myself, pretty much professionally if I do say so myself.

And after not too long of that, I started feeling like I would die without it. But I didn't know how to talk to people anymore. What to say, how to act, what to do. In just a few short years I forgot how to be a human. I still have no fucking clue of what to do in social situations. But, and now fast forward to the present.

Then there's days where I wish I could hit the lottery. Just to hire a group of Russian mercenaries to kill all the stupid people that annoy me. The worst part, I'm not even talking about genuinely annoying. I'm talking about my version. Example, someone asking me a question that I feel is pointless, makes my head ring, and I go back to the thought of hiring mercenaries. I can't really explain this part well, but I feel like people do shit on purpose. There's NO way the general public is so stupid, and annoying that I actually pray for mass genocide on a daily basis.

I wanted to talk to them again and teach them a lesson. But overall it worked out fine, so I\\'m happy about that. I tried my best and I feel good now, as opposed to anxious and shaky. I see lots of people asking here if you can overcome social anxiety and I\\'m not sure if you can get rid of it completely - maybe - but I do know that it can be massively improved. I used to be agoraphobic, I was afraid to leave the house because of the people I\\'d have to encounter. Now I can leave the house and do things that I never thought I\\'d be able to do. 5 years ago I couldn\\'t even pick up a telephone and now I can deal with high-stress situations like this without completely breaking down. I definitely could have handled it better, but I did my best and hopefully stuff like this will make me more socially hardy. It\\'s totally possible to improve guys. :)\\')', 'labels': ['related to an outdoor space with negative effect', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'not related to an outdoor space'], 'scores': [0.46620941162109375, 0.28368690609931946, 0.18070855736732483, 0.06939511746168137]}\n",

            "{'sequence': '(\\'I did it! I got my hair cut!. Im going to apologize in advance and just say that I often give too many details in my stories making them very long but that\\'s just how I do it. I like to explain everything. My thought process what I was thinking and feeling.. A few days ago I realised that my hair had gotten pretty long. It had been around 3 months since my last haircut. I know it was before December 24 2015. For a few hours last night before I went to bed I was trying to look up places I could get my hair cut. The price and how long it would take to walk. Every time I\\'ve had my hair cut and the hairdresser asks how to cut it I just stutter a \"err idk just shorter. Do what you want\" and in a thread I\\'ve made before about getting my hair cut people were suggesting that I show a picture of what I want done. So I looked up pictures of myself on phone and narrowed it down to 3 pictures I believe were taken a week or two after I had my hair cut. \"This looks short enough. I\\'ll just show them this\". The whole day leading up to me entering the door to the haircutter I was thinking \"should I go. Should I just do it another day\" but each step I took (eating breakfast, getting dressed, going outside) that got me closer to the haircutter the more forced I felt to actually go through with it. I tried to think less and just do it. The place is a rather small place and you can\\'t even pay with a card, only cash (as I found out) and the guy who cut my hair didn\\'t speak the language very well. When I went in there were 2 employees and the boss. All being with a customer and cutting their hair so I sit down and wait. Usually the place is pretty full (as I said it\\'s a pretty small room) and I was worried about looking like a fool in front of other customers trying to ask if they had time for a drop-in customer. A lot of people who go there seems to be friends with the owner too or know them very well which makes it feel worse. Like if the owner is just a complete stranger to them then we have something in common. I sit there for a couple of minutes and the owner (who\\'s cutting someone\\'s hair) makes eye contact with me like he\\'s wondering what I\\'m doing. Making me feel anxious ish. A guy walks in, he clearly knows the owner, after a bit he asks how long until he\\'s free. Owner says 5m and the guy goes outside to smoke or whatever. So there I am, just sitting there awkwardly, wondering if I should be asking if they have time for a drop in or something. Or do I just wait here until one of them is done cutting and stands behind the register?? Ofc i chose to sit there like a socially awkward dude. Once the owner is done with his customer he starts to get ready to go outside for a smoke break. I didn\\'t stand up or talk to him I just sat awkwardly. I felt like I had missed an opportunity. But a minute or so after that the other guy was done cutting his customers hair too and I asked him if he has time for a drop in and he said yes. And here\\'s the best part. Remember, this is the very first time I was going to show the haircutter a picture of how I want mine cut, so I had rehearsed it a million times in my head already. Show picture, say I want something like that, sit down. I awkwardly say \"is. . I brought a picture\" I pull up my phone which has the picture already loaded. \"Something like this?\" He takes the phone and asks \"do this?\" I\\'m like ..yeah do that. Like that. A few moments of silence after I sit down, he seems hesitant to cut it like that. \"Like that or.. better\" NO YOU\\'RE DEVIATING FROM THE SCRIPT. \"Ehh heh better I guess if you can\" are the words that leave my mouth. He says \"this picture.. not very good. Not that good looking hair\" I\\'m like well shit I spent like 10 minutes anxious over which picture to use and it\\'s not a great pic I agree but it\\'s fine. It\\'s short. I just want it shorter. So I say \"heh yeah do better if you can then. If you want\". \"I can do better\" he says and starts cutting. Once he\\'s done he says something and I was like huh what did you say? I asked that maybe 2 to 3 times during that whole visit. I felt like such an incompetent ass. Oh remember how I didn\\'t know it was a cash only place? He said nope sorry can\\'t pay with card here. And I\\'m like oh god.. \"where can I find an atm..\" he says around the corner \"you know where?\" I Say no and he gestures again around the corner. So I go around the corner but see no atm I ask 2 women passing by where the nearest atm is and it\\'s a biiit further away. Around another corner. I feel like the haircutter might think I\\'m not gonna pay so I had intentionally left my jacket behind. Had to stand in line for the atm (lady took god same forever) and I was thinking about how long it was taking me to get back so I could frikken pay him. Anyway I finally had it done. Usually my dad drives me to some place and comes with me (since he has to wait for me anyway) which makes me feel like shit and like a child. I\\'m 22. It looks good now I think and I rode the high of \" I did something today \" for a few hours after that. If you actually read everything then I\\'m sorry haha. I should learn how to be more concise but I just feel like I want to convey every detail possible. As if the person listening to my story was there. That\\'s why I like pictures. Shows what it actually is like instead of them having to imagine it. Maybe it just looks like a lot cus I\\'m on my phone.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'I can\\'t be alone. So here it goes.... I\\'m a 20 yo male from the US. I have been consciously struggling with social anxiety for about 3 years now. I really don\\'t know where to start because my anxiety spreads across many categories. The most prominent and most harmful,though, is my fear of rejection. I am constantly dwelling on my peers\\' apparent perception of me. After every action I make, whether it be getting out of my chair or commenting on a coworkers statement, I analyze the body/facial expression of the other parties in the room. Most of the time my interpretation is a negative one. I am a first born child and am comfort able with my alone time and quite enjoy it but my ADHD makes me outgoing and talkative (though sometimes about obscure topics). I very much enjoy the connection from carrying on a conversation with someone and knowing that they understand and empathize with you. Throughout high-school I was the class clown. I always had some snide remark to make or an opinion to give on everything. I had my small group of friends but I felt that I annoyed even them. I graduated HS and decided enough was enough. I\\'m not gonna be that obnoxious guy anymore. I got back on my medicine and went off to college. Screwed up pretty bad my first semester and got kicked out of my housing (still enrolled ). I felt horrible about it because the offense that got me kicked out was something I told my parents I stopped doing a while back when they caught me. Anyway.. At this point I had just started to make friends outside of the people I knew from my hometown and I could see things about to turn around. But when I found out that I was being kicked out of my housing and wasting my parents 8k they had already spent on the following semester housing as well as the rent for the new place I fell into a really bad depression. I lost connection with all of my friends except one( who happened to be my previous roommate and got kicked out with me). We felt each other\\'s pain and consoled one another with alcohol and Xbox one. I started drinking .. A lot. Like everyday. Ironically it didn\\'t affect my grades though because we were still in freshman level courses and Calc always came easy to me. Fast forward 1 year. Me and roommate get a new place together and are doing great(or so it seems). We move into a little college apt complex where I already knew a ton of people. That first semester was great. We got along great daily and never fought. Shit we still have never fought. We hung out with the same group of friends and I was even more popular than him! I was having a great time and really loved my roommate/best friend like a brother. Then winter break came. All was going great. Still partying in my hometown and catching up with old friends and still hanging out with the ones that came home from school with me. Blah blah blah I ran into a girl from one of my classes downtown one night and we made plans to hangout. I brought a friend she brought a friend. The friend she brought ended up being my girlfriend and first love of 2 years. And my friend and the other girl hooked up a little but that\\'s a different story.... Getting tired of typing on phone so I\\'m gonna wrap it up ... Roommate and Girl from downtown start talking. (Me and that girl always had some spark between us but never made a move on it again story for another time) girl talks shit about roommate behind his back to me (dumb) calls him gay and says she only hangs out with him for a gay cuddle buddy. I tell him he doesn\\'t believe me. Asks her she denies it. She keeps talking shit. She starts getting really controlling and making him look like her puppy following her around and conforming to her every whim. It was nauseating. At this point there was a little tension between her and I as I was obviously not gonna take her side on things because she was manipulating my best friend and I was pretty blatant about that. But I decided to take the high road and still be her friend and what not. Things started to go south. She started to act weird and say passively rude things to me when she was drunk but never out right aggressive. She started to resent my other friend (the one that hooked up with her a while back ) and would be very aggressive with him at parties. To the point of getting him kicked out of a few. I didn\\'t care, he was being an ass most of the time and deserved it. Then she started lumping me into her little outbursts. And one night she got particularly drunk and went off on him. Once he was kicked out she turned it on me. I didn\\'t even listen to it though cause she was obviously obliterated so I just walked home. Next weekend there was a birthday party down the road from me and she was going as well as all my friends so I decided to go. Stayed for an hour or so but didn\\'t know many people and was getting bored so I went to leave. Said my good byes to the people I knew there and went for the door. Saw roommate and girl sitting by the door. Said bye to roommate and went to say bye to her but she was obviously ignoring me so I patted her lightly on the head and kindly said \"bye \\'girl\\'\" and opened the door. I hear \"did he just pat me on the head?? Is he calling me a dog or something ?!?\" I try to b line out of this drunken situation before it manifests into a full on shit show. But I was too late. She runs for the door and shoves me as much as she could and yells \"GET OUT!\" ( her signature drunken outburst at the time ) I turned around and calmly said \"\\'girl\\' I didn\\'t mean to offend you, we\\'re all friends here I\\'m sorry, you\\'re just drunk\" or something along those lines. She stops her feet in place and yells for roommate at the top of her lungs. And like clock work he comes running out of no where and stands by her side. I had had enough so I just grabbed my girl by the arm and we walked home. Then things started to get weird. I talked to my roommate about it and asked him why she was mad at me. He said she wasn\\'t. Okay cool. So i tried talking to her and she ignores me. Okay so I ask him again same response. Wtf roommate bros before hoes right? Apparently he had never heard the expression. Then a day would pass when I didn\\'t see or hear from him. Which hadn\\'t happened since the day I met him. Oh well I figured I\\'d let them work it out. Then weeks passed. Then we\\'d talk about bullshit. Then more weeks. Then a month. Then the semester was over and he left without saying a word. We had already signed a lease for the next semester and he told me a week before the next semester that he had backed out last minute and was living somewhere else. Great Well he moves in with some of my so called friends and then I lost contact with most of them as they were girls friends before mine. So I was slowly phased out of the group and then was all alone. And social anxiety has just snowballed. TL;DR : best friend didn\\'t listen to bros b4 hoes and then took all my friends and left my by myself.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'Friendless people, the key to not feeling like the worst person in the world is to stop caring (to state the obvious). For a while I never understood people who posted on here and on other subs saying they have no friends but they\\'re okay with that. If they\\'re okay with it it won\\'t change! But I was wrong. 90% of people are going to think you\\'re a weirdo for not having friends, but they don\\'t know you, and they\\'re shallow. No one is going to support your loneliness so you might as well accept that sometimes shit happens in life and you end up alone for a while but that\\'s okay and natural. I think the guilt of loneliness affects your mental health before the actual loneliness does. Growing up I became more and more aware of my lack of friends. I had more friends then than I have now, but less than most people I knew. For a long time I didn\\'t see the problem. When I didn\\'t see my lack of friends as a problem, this meant that when I was having a social interaction I wasn\\'t self conscious. I didn\\'t have my mothers voice in the back of my head telling me I should have more friends. I remember in school, between the ages of 12-16, I would yap and yap to anyone, and no, I didn\\'t make friends with everyone I talked to, but I made some, and was generally liked. As I got older, I cut off a group of friends from my home town because I had nothing in common with them and they were preoccupied with being popular and I wasn\\'t. My mam would always say that I needed more friends when she noticed I stopped hanging around them. I remember I brought 2 friends home for dinner and my sister said \"oh look, her friends. All 2 of them\". I became more aware of my loneliness. As my awareness increased, I got more withdrawn, basically a hermit, was overly critical of myself and overly self conscious. Because everyone around me was telling me it wasn\\'t okay to have few friends, even though I had been happy. Something that struck me in college was how everyone sort of acted as if they wanted to be perceived as popular. This was probably my warped SA perception, and this stopped me from talking to people. Sometimes I read threads here, particularly /r/relationships (my favourite sub) and see people talking about how having no friends is a \"red flag\" and that \"boring people finish last\" and that when you have no friends \"you\\'re the common denominator\" and there\\'s something wrong with you. I see where they\\'re coming from, and while reading things like this serves to make us all more self aware, it doesn\\'t make it easier, and it\\'s not healthy to blame yourself. I had an epiphany recently and I realized that... people in my hometown probably don\\'t talk about me negatively, if I talked to them they\\'d probably be open to me. People I meet daily that I think hate me, don\\'t hate me, if they do they\\'re basing it off one encounter, they don\\'t know me and I shouldn\\'t care. When I walk my dog, people who see me out in public don\\'t know I\\'m unemployed and friendless, or that my hair is really greasy. No one but me has felt my pain or understands, so screw it. Even if I have screwed up my reputation by being a recluse, it\\'s so easy to change how people see you, if you only have the courage to try. There\\'s no point in feeling guilt about SA. We are going to find friends at some point or another, our SA will die down eventually with personal growth or outside help. We might as well be okay with our circumstances in the meantime. I used to spend all my alone time (so, all the time) feeling bad about it, but what\\'s the point? That will only make me more bitter. Let\\'s stop acting like having no friends is the worst thing in the world. We\\'re not actually missing out on much, maybe this realization will help us to stop trying too hard in social situations and messing up. Loneliness is painful but only because other people make it painful by reminding us how flawed we are. I know it\\'s impossible to implement \"stop caring\" overnight, but please try. I hope other friendless people out there can get to the point in life where they don\\'t care what others think, because after 22 years it has finally freed me. *Tl;dr: People make us feel shit for not having friends. But realize if people didn\\'t make us feel shit about ourselves, we\\'d probably be okay. Try and get to the point where you realize that it\\'s okay to be who you are and be happy alone. Stop comparing yourself to others and just stop caring what people think.

I\\'ll just get right into the story of what just took place. Incoming wall of text, bear with me. So I\\'m good friends with my neighbors and I was at their place hanging out when they decided they want to go bar hopping. They asked me if I wanted to go and I decided what the hell, why not? I\\'ve never been bar hopping, not even a bar since I turned 21 (in April. Normally I just go to the liquor store down the street and drink with my roommate or by myself). I told them I\\'ve never done it before so if they could guide me through it that\\'d be great, and they said sure. So it comes time to start walking. One of the guys is already drunk, the other is super experienced with this stuff. I felt so out of place. Not to mention they were wearing shirts that supported the home team (football game AND homecoming tonight, that alone should have told me it\\'d be way too busy for me to handle, especially for my first time at a bar). I was wearing what I normally wear, some jeans and a black sweater and nasty grey vans that I wore to work today and forgot to change out of. Not to mention these guys are way taller than me. I\\'m not even short, I\\'m 5\"11 but they were a few inches taller than me so all of this combined made me feel so out of place. So basically I was going into a social anxiety nightmare already anxious a fuck for other reasons than I was going out. Fuck. The walk took about 15 minutes, felt like forever, but when I got to the bar, I felt like it didn\\'t take long enough. This bar was packed beyond reason. Inside it didn\\'t look like there was anywhere to even move. And the line was massive. Halfway up, my friend decided now was the best time to mention there\\'s a $5 front. I didn\\'t know what that meant (in case someone doesn\\'t either, it means a $5 fee to get in). I had already told him I didn\\'t have any cash on me but he said don\\'t worry, they take debit cards. Here\\'s where I really start to panic. I ask if he can spot me and he said no, I should have brought cash with me. Fucking hell. Second panic: the people behind me are so close, like they kept brushing up against me and bumping into me. I can\\'t stand people touching me unexpectedly. But I\\'m at a bar, obviously that happens. But I start to freak out thinking the people around me can hear me say I don\\'t have the money, asking me friend, not knowing what to do, thinking they think I\\'m a loser for not knowing how to do this. I\\'m just about to leave because I\\'m about to have a break down. I tell my \"friend\" I think I\\'m just going to bail. He\\'s like yea okay whatever. I then start thinking the people behind me are thinking I\\'m even more of a loser for bailing and not doing what everyone else is doing. I end up saying fuck it and I start walking away. I walked towards the Taco Bell across the street and call my roommate and ask him to pick me up there. He said he was actually on his way to his girlfriend\\'s. I said oh never mind then, I don\\'t want you to drive all that way. He said it\\'s not a big deal and he comes to pick me up. Now I feel bad about inconveniencing him.

I have been homeschooled from Pre-K to senior year, and I am 18 now. For the most part I have been oblivious to the public perception of this method of teaching. I see everywhere online that it\\'s kind of frowned upon. People say that homeschoolers are anti-social white-trash potential school shooters. Everytime I see these comments I feel a strong pang in my chest. I actually don\\'t consider myself to be very weird, I am kind of average to be honest. I am obsessed with music, love my netflix, and enjoy travelling. Not very weird I wouldn\\'t think. I try very hard to hide the fact that I was homeschooled, simply because I immediately get lumped into these stereotypes. As a homeschooler, I feel like something was stolen from me. I never asked to be different. It doesn\\'t feel fair to me that I have this burden of an alternate lifestyle. I think it kind of stems from my personality. I hate conflict and hostile opinions. Which might be caused by my homeschooling. Such a mess right? My mother has a strong passion for homeschooling, and I remember her telling me that she would cry if I decided (or got forced by CPS) to go to public school. This created a sort of \"guilty conscious, or feeling that I have to stick with the program to keep her happy. She would actually threaten to \"put me in public school\" if I tried to talk to her about my doubts. Don\\'t get the wrong idea about her though, I love her and can kind of see where she\\'s coming from. She may have had a bad time in high school, so it\\'s like a terror to her. But, I don\\'t feel like I would have had the same experience. Sometimes I daydream about what I could have been like if I went to public school. Maybe I would some kind of sauve marauder! Or at least I would be assertive enough, self-relient, and have a good group of friends. Instead, I am just an awkward burden for most people my age. I feel like I was cheated a better life almost. I also have extreme insecurities when it comes to intelligence. Actually, anytime I think I see proof of my being stupid, I respond emotionally. Again, the pang in my chest feeling. I feel like my education could have been better, for the past few years I have mainly been teaching myself because my mom is hella busy. I am working on my ACT and I\\'ll hopefully get into college, which I am not sure I can do since I am a homeschooler. I don\\'t even know if I have a GPA, because there hasn\\'t been any kind of grading going on, not that I know of anyway. I am really good at math, but not so good at factoid/common-sense stuff. Right now I am in a jiu-jitsu class (free at my gym) and my instructor will constantly ask for a factoid, like \"How much blood is in the body?\" or \"What\\'s the fastest animal on Earth\". I couldn\\'t answer either of these, and it really bothers me. I feel like I should know this stuff, and I might have known it if I was in public school. Sometimes I will know one, but can\\'t think of it fast enough. Somehow, I always end up looking like an idiot in front of my class. Whether it be not answering questions, or having an insanely hard time with directions and spatial awareness. Yes, the homeschooling was for religious reasons. My mom says it\\'s because she met a homeschooler and was impressed, but I kind of doubt that. She\\'s an extreme Christian of sorts. She taught me creation science for a while, but I learned how it\\'s fraudulent. I have a basic understanding of evolution now, but I probably don\\'t know as much as other people my age. She\\'s also a big conspirator. Alex Jones, 9/11 Truth, FEMA, etc. I believed these too, but have since shaken them off. I am actually still in the closet about a lot of this stuff because I don\\'t want to have a heated discussion with her. I am still a Christian, but I have a lot of problems with religion. I guess it\\'s more of a personal thing that I don\\'t feel the need to express or go to church for. I have never had a girlfriend. I have never even had a kiss before. I have held hands with a girl and I took one on a date. But, the date was a disaster (she was kind of a bitch, and she didn\\'t consider it to be a date) and the \"holding hands\" part grossed me out. It\\'s starting to drive me crazy in a way, I really want to experience love, romance, and sex are like. But I feel like I have been permanently cockblocked by my upbringing. I\\'ll probably die a virgin. Anytime I have been close to starting something up with a girl, my mom wasn\\'t too far behind me. I feel like once they see my mom and the interactions we have, they write me off as a \"momma\\'s boy\" and immediately lose any attraction they once had. I am actually a pretty attractive looking guy, but the way I am drives them away. I have never had a job (unless you could call mowing your grandmother\\'s grass a real job). I have a supreme fear of the unknown here. Like I feel like they won\\'t hire me because I am not the best at social skills. Or, I feel like I am going to fuck up really bad with whatever they assign for me. Or, I feel like I will get bullied by coworkers and have a horrible time there. The real world is a scary concept to me, I have seen how horrible people can be on the internet (especially with the \\'kys\\' and red hot angry comments). I feel like I am too soft for the world, too sheltered. I feel like I will get eaten alive almost. So, it creates a vicious cycle, I don\\'t know when I\\'ll get a job, or what job I will get.

Warning, this post is quite long, but if you enjoy reading about a person’s journey’s to self-improvement, then this post is for you. A bit of backstory on me. I’m 22 right now, but I’ve been fighting social anxiety ever since I was in fifth grade (that’s rounds out to about half of my life). For as long as I remember, I hated myself, and there was a multitude of reasons for this such as growing up poor in a rich area, being different from all my peers (mixed race, foreign sounding name, etc.), and not seeing a healthy relationship between my mother and father. The way I coped with my insecurities was through video games. Lots and lots of video games. It was so easy to escape the reality I hated by living in another one that made me feel alive. I did this for years and years, throughout middle school and especially through high school and into college. With all the time I invested into video games, I was severely underdeveloped in my social skills, and I’d even pit myself in the bottom 10% next to anti-social deaf people. Everywhere I go, I would avoid eye contact with people. I hated even going outside and seeing other people, because I just knew how awkward and weird they would think I am for the way I looked and the way I walked. Class was a nightmare. I’d try to sit in the back, and every time the teacher would call on me, my heart would race to the speed of light, and my voice would quiver as I attempted to formulate a semi-coherent sentence. By now you might be wondering how the hell did I transform from this video game addicted, socially awkward boy with low self-esteem into a person that could stand up for himself? Answer: I got tired. Tired of living life feeling like a piece of shit. Tired of not even being able to look into the mirror without cringing. Tired of thinking I wasn’t worth anyone’s time, and that I’ll die alone. And that’s when I discovered /r/socialanxiety. For the first time I saw that I wasn’t the only one in the world dealing with what I thought was my own unique personal hell. I heard stories, stories of peoples’ struggles, and even some of their success. But to be honest, I never found enough actionable advice here to steer my life in the right direction, so I started looking elsewhere. I started looking at other subreddits, and I even started reading self-improvement books and listening to podcasts. Somewhere around this point, something finally clicked in my head that me realize that change is possible, “even for me.” Here are three steps I followed to transform my life after believing that I could transform my life: Step 1) I started an exercise regimen and eating healthier. Even though my routine sucked and I made every mistake in the book, the small progress I made further made me see that I could improve my own physique through grit and not shoving junk food down my throat. Let’s not kid ourselves, appearances do matter, not so much that they should dominate every ounce of your thought and life focus, but I’ve come to learn that neglecting it and pretending like it doesn’t matter only perpetuated a cycle of negative thoughts about myself such as “I’ll never look good, I’m not like that, I’m ugly, etc.” If you feel ugly now, working out and dressing decently can unsurprisingly improve the way you feel about yourself. Try it. If you’re fighting social anxiety like I was, you’re going to need every bit of improvement you can get and this one can even be done without any social interaction (though that is against the road of improvement). Step 2) I started paying attention to my body language. I think this may be one of the hardest points to tackle as a person with SA, and I can’t even say that my own personal body language is in tip top shape as of yet, but I can say that even by being aware that body language exists puts you miles ahead of the average person with SA. So much communication is portrayed through the body, such as standing up straight, not looking down at the ground, and even just how you deal with silence. If you’re a guy and you’re into girls, this a quality that is heavily observed, much more so than the verbal communication. If you’re a girl, you probably know this and have more of knack for this than the average guy does. However complicated this may seem, simple things that I mentioned such as standing up straight and keeping your head-up can psychologically boost your mood. Step 3) I did things I was uncomfortable with, step by step. I think this is the hardest and most crucial step of my process, and it could be divided into countless sub-steps and stories, but I want to hit the main point that the only way to become comfortable is to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. Here’s an example. I’m at grocery store, I really don’t want to ask the worker for help finding an item. But I do it, just to see what will happen. I’m nervous. I approach her and ask where the broccoli is. She tells me it’s on aisle seven. “Shit I don’t where aisle seven is, should I ask her, no she’ll think I’m weird.” I nod okay and walk away quickly. “Shit, why didn’t I ask her to point me to where aisle seven is .“ I find another worker, then ask if he can show me to aisle seven, and sure enough he happily tells me where to go. I realize this isn’t so bad and am now not afraid to ask for directions. The point of this example is take small steps and experiment for yourself. The more you do, the more you will learn. And I hate to say it, but most of what we learn isn’t through others, but by our own doing, and especially doing things that we think will suck. Now I could tell my own personal stories on this topic for pages and pages, but I want to highlight that I’ve done things as uncomfortable as confronting someone about their shitty behavior, asking girls to dates (*gasp*, no way, how is that possible, as my old self would say), actually being on the date and making mistakes (learning mistakes I’ll have you know), and even performing on a stage in front of a live audience. But the most recent highlight is negotiating my salary at my current job. I did my research about my current job that I’m getting hired for, and I noticed that I was being heavily underpaid for the position. I knew that being underpaid would make me feel resentment as an employee and not allow me to do my best work, so I decided “fuck it, rather than have a terrible time at this position feeling passive-aggressive about my situation and being weird in the office, I’m going to tackle this right now.” I looked up as many negotiation tactics as possible, spent time in the shower for a week debating with my manager in my imagination, and finally reassured myself that I know my worth. I approached my manager 2 days ago. Long story short, I nailed the negotiation and got a 10k salary raise. All the uncomfortable things I ever dealt with leading up to this made me the person I was going into that negotiation. All the hard work, mistakes, pain, and learning that I did made me become someone who was worthy of that 10k raise. If you threw 16 year old, or even 20 year old socially awkward me into the same position, I would not have not have raised a single word. I probably would not have even passed the interview for this job. As long as this post has been, there’s so many details that I left out, but I really hope that I’ve demonstrated that it is truly is possible to fight your own social anxiety, and even use it as fuel to better yourself. I still have lots of room to grow, and I’m not the most socially savvy or charming person you’ll ever meet, but I can say with confidence and pride that I’m 100 times better than the person I used to be.')\", 'labels': ['not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect', 'related to an outdoor space with negative effect'], 'scores': [0.46256569027900696, 0.19661486148834229, 0.17524389922618866, 0.1655755490064621]}\n",
            "{'sequence': '(\\' Will soon be having a conversation with my manager about my SA... Hey guys. So I\\'m a lower level supervisor where I work and today I had to get together with a group of my co-workers and my manager to go over some things that they (co-workers) haven\\'t been completing on a consistent basis. Performance stuff basically. My manager and I had talked the night before about how we were going to approach the meeting and we agreed I would try and take the lead on most of the conversation and he would chime in when necessary. He, as well as a majority of management (big company, lots of higher-ups) know that I have some anxiety issues, but don\\'t really know the extent of it for the most part. So the meeting didn\\'t go all that great. Not terrible, but not very good. I started things off and kind of just nose dived into what the group of co-workers had done wrong the day before. No intro, no nice lead in or explanation as to why we were there. Just \"ok so this wasn\\'t done, that was dirty, this wasn\\'t taken care of..\" etc, etc. My manager ended up back-packing the meeting per usual and the day continued on as it normally would. Well towards the end of the day he wanted to get together again (just him and I) so that we could talk about how it went. We go into the same room where we held the meeting that morning which is this bright ass (like apple store bright) conference room and we start to chat. We go over some normal day to day stuff and then we get on the subject of how we think the meeting went. I told him I think it could have gone better and he agrees which is why he wanted to talk with me to begin with. I told him I\\'m particularly aware of my public speaking difficulties and that I know I could have directed the meeting in a more constructive way. I told him I struggle with certain things and that I\\'ve been devoting a lot of time outside of work to try and help with that stuff. Then he stopped me and asked me what type of struggles.. I paused for a second and said \"oh, well I have anxiety and uh..\" pause, not looking at him.. \"it\\'s just been really hard and, uh..\" At this moment I started to well up with tears. He could tell I was on the verge of crying and I knew I would if I said anything else so I told him I needed to step away for a second. So I stepped into an empty office and just tried to wait out the emotion. I was completely, utterly overwhelmed. After a couple minutes he came over and asked me if I\\'d Iike to walk outside with him for a bit. We took a walk around the neighboring businesses while I, thoroughly embarrassed, stammered out the few sentences of explanation that I could (I should say that my manager is a really good dude, fairly close to my age and also super understanding). He let me know that he\\'s all ears if I\\'d like to try and talk about everything at a later time as I was just about finished with my shift for the day. I told him that I\\'ve actually been wanting to do that for a while so we agreed that he\\'d give me a call within the next couple of days to discuss things.. I know I need to talk about a lot with him, I just don\\'t know *how* much. Do I tell him the full truth? That I\\'m severely depressed because of my SA and that if affects me every day of my life? That it drastically inhibits my ability to perform as a supervisor? I was on the verge of breaking down at work which is something I\\'ve never done, ever. Let alone in front of my boss. I\\'ve spent my whole life trying to hide my SA and have developed an ultra thick, guarded wall as a result. I\\'ve avoided these types of conversations with people (other than my family) because of how overwhelming the emotions become. I\\'m scared that if I completely open up to him I\\'ll raise serious questions about my ability to perform my job requirements. Either way, the dynamic between him and I will absolutely not be the same after this convo. This post became way, waay longer than I meant it to be. Cheers if you made it all the way to the end. Thank you..sincerely, for any responses. TL;DR I ended up nearly crying in front of my manager after being overwhelmed with emotions when asked to elaborate on my struggles with SA. We planned a follow up conversation at a later time so that I can gather myself and allow for a proper explanation. Now I\\'m just not sure how much I want to share with him as I\\'m scared it might jeopardize my job, or at least my standings within my department. \\')', 'labels': ['not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect', 'related to an outdoor space with negative effect'], 'scores': [0.7930276393890381, 0.08996259421110153, 0.06794147193431854, 0.04906829446554184]}\n",

In the 3rd grade I had a PSP that I would go on Facebook with  and just try to socialize on there.

So ever since I was born till about 5th or 6th grade I was always a outgoing kid just the polar opposit of how I am today. I wasn't shy I could male new friends and talk to other kids with no worries at all. I went to a school that was k-8 I stayed there all the way till 8th grade and so did pretty much everyone from my starting kindergarten class did the same so we were real close shared birthday parties , had sleepovers all of us were on a soccer team for a good while. But at around 5th grade i started to get a bit chubby i dont know if it was pubery or my aunt always giving me treats. And the same friends who i had known since kindergarten started teasing me not all but most also we were kinda finding who we were and making our groups of friends. So this put me down to where i didnt wanna go to birthday parties anymore or do things with them because i knew I would be made fun of or called fat or asked why my face was red all the time so i started staying home alot. My dad didn't like this so he would make me go to these events where i would be teased. I never told him and I would have to make a scene to not go. So he gave up on me going and i kinda just stayed at home all the way till we graduated till 8th grade I wasn't the weird kid everyone made fun of i had friends i guess I just got used to being teased brushed it off and all that bit it bothered me i would have breakdowns cry askingy parents if I was fat. I went to a different high school then everyone else didn't grt teased and felt a bit better i geaduated got in shape and all but all of that just kinda left a mark. I feel i dont have social anxiety because while i do get nervous going to a interview or meeting someone or starting a new job. I more freaking out oit about what the person thinks about how i look how i talk what I say how I performy duties. Pretty much the teasing i endured and kinda sucked up and bottled up left me with a inferiority complex, slight case of body dismorhia, and extremely low self esteem that all form this trifecta of shit that causes me to think I have social anxiety when really its just all those other things Tl;DR my social anxiety stems from being teased and mocked for being a chubby kid in elementary causinge me to have low self esteem, inferority complex and slight body dismorhia.

            "{'sequence': \"('Should I talk to her?. This is going to be a long story as there is a lot of backstory/context needed to understand. Those who are ‘meant’ to read this  and offer guidance, will. I hope :) No idea how to cut it down into a TLDR as it is far too lengthy. I'll try to keep this first backstory as short  and to the point as possible. I'm 21, live in Australia on the east coast, grew up in Sydney and lived there until I was 18. I have a sister who is 7 years older who still lives in our hometown. Lost my father at a young age at 13. I've been battling depression for over 5 years since I was 15. I moved 2 hours away from my hometown at 18  and my depression got much worse. I stopped seeing friends, stopped going out, stopped talking to my friends/family which led to dealing with anxiety issues which led to social anxiety due to isolating myself. (Among other symptoms) I've recently started seeing a psychologist, getting out of the house more, I'm finally starting to feel like going out  and doing things. I want to meet people. I've been out more/done more in January of this year than I have the past 2 years. Finally starting to feel 'normal'. I still haven't reconnected with any of my old friends. I haven't posted anything on my personal social media accounts (Facebook/Instagram/Snapchat) since I first moved in late 2014. Haven't spoken to any friends since then  and haven't seen them either. Some have reached out to me but I never replied. Haven’t had a job since I moved up here either. For some reason I'm still afraid to reach out to them because I know that will lead to eventually meeting up with them in person. I'm even afraid to post anything on social media from fear of them reaching out to me. Because I know this will lead down the same route. I haven't made any new friends since moving from my hometown, haven't worked or studied  and basically feel like a complete failure. Afraid of what they will say, think or feel about me cos I have no life per say. I have already made a post looking for advice/guidance regarding the issue related to my old friends, however the above context was necessary to lead onto my next story which I am solely looking for advice/guidance for. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ New years eve I went to a house party with my older Sister cos I had nothing else to do, literally, and met all her friends etc. People were drinking, majority of people were on drugs, MDMA, LSD  and Ketamine was available. I hadn’t had drugs for 3 years since Australia day in 2014 when I was 18. I didn’t plan on taking anything. I met a girl who lived there, friend of my sisters who’s my age - lets call her Mary. I was told by a few people she thought I was attractive  and wanted to hookup. I haven’t hooked up with anyone for over 2 years and I actually was thinking that about her anyway so I was keen. I was drinking a lot when I first got there because of my anxiety, meeting new people etc. and ended up having to stop drinking because I was getting sick mixing it with weed. (Only drank 4 times last year so I had a very low tolerance). A few hours later I was in Marys room with her, my sister  and another girl who lived there just talking; lets call her Barbara. Barbara asked if we all wanted to get any more MDMA caps (her bf had stuff people could buy during the night). All of them had already taken an MDMA cap each earlier on in the night  and they all said yeah to having another one, which left me to decide; I ended up asking for one since I felt comfortable, didn’t feel pressured by them and the moment felt right to do it (granted my judgement was way off cause I was drinking/smoking; not the best idea to jump on drugs with people you barely know, but I felt safe being with my sister). So I took mine with them  and they left me and Mary in the room not long after. Started talking to Mary, getting to know her and all that. Basically having a d andm. She was telling me that she is going overseas this year to a US summer camp for 6 weeks. I felt so unaccomplished  and like a loser basically because there’s no way I could do that. I told her she’s really ambitious  and we started talking about other things while smoking weed together. We ended up hooking up for awhile, kissed at midnight  and started talking more after that. At one point while we were outside having a cigarette, she asked me to tell her ‘my life story’, it caught me off guard cos if I’m honest I don’t even know what it is. I got about halfway through  and somehow we got interrupted and I never got to hear hers or finish mine. I realised I was saying a lot of bad things that had happened in my life, rather than who I am and what I do? Anyway, Mary  and Barbara decided to come back with me, my sister  and her partner back to their place about an hour or two after Midnight to spend the rest of the night together. They were all going to take a tab of LSD each when we got back, I didn’t want to have psychedelics so I had a second MDMA cap. When we got back to my sisters place , Mary  and Barbara lost an acid tab when we got there. Eventually we all gave up looking for it  and they all took a tab each. Not long after taking the tab it got kinda weird with her, her vibe changed  and she wasn’t talking much, we weren’t as ‘close’ physically as earlier (not cuddling n stuff) but we were holding hands? They were all waiting for the LSD to kick in  and everyone wasn’t really talking much, and cos I hadn’t taken a tab I wasn’t on the same ‘level’. I think that’s where things changed cos my 2nd MDMA cap was coming on while her tab was coming on so we were on different wavelengths. We were all chilling in the lounge room laying down for about an hour and it was pretty obvious Barbara was the 5th wheel. Mary, her friend  and my sister went into her room and were talking for awhile. Eventually they came out and we all went for a cigarette on the balcony and they basically came and said they were leaving. They were going to stay the night then an hour or two later after we got back they said they were leaving cos her friend wanted to be with her boyfriend. I was too out of it to leave the unit  and when I said ‘I’m too f*cked to leave when Mary asked me if I was coming she said 'well your ambitious’. Never has my gut dropped so much. Instant regret. Such a horrible feeling, intensified by the drugs. I’m sure they left cos they started feeling uncomfortable being there, particularly Marys friend being the 5th wheel without her BF on new years eve. My sister, her partner  and I all planned on coming back to their placed to end the night there regardless, a safe place to come back to. So we kind of all had it in our head that we weren’t leaving after we got back. Looking back I wish I went back with Mary  and her friend but it probably wasn’t the best idea because they ended up taking another tab and ‘day-tripped’. Which could have ended up quite messy since it was pretty messy after they left anyway just being with my sister n her partner. Who knows what would happened - I never will know cos I chose not to go. I told my sister n her partner the next morning what Mary said when she left  and I asked them if I screwed up by not going back with her - my sisters husband said yeah i thought I heard her say something like that but my sister sort of dismissed it. They were both pretty adamant that I hadn’t ‘fucked up’ though - the next day my sister said she spoke to Mary on FB and asked her about what she said before she left that night  and she said that she didn't say that at all, something like 'oh alright then' was what she apparently said but I didn't really believe it. Mary sent me a message first on snapchat a couple days after new years basically saying ‘hey was nice to meet you had a nice time  and we said we should chill n have a sesh sometime’ etc. So we started talking a little bit, went to buy weed from their place a day later  and added her on FB but didn’t ask for her number. Such an idiot. Anyway, It was my sisters birthday the first week of 2017  and she had a party the first weekend (7th Jan - Saturday), Mary  and I were both going so we were going to catch up there. I was talking to her leading up to my sisters bday party after i came home on the Thursday and then the next night I had a panic attack after smoking some weed (happened cos of repressed emotions from traumatic domestic event in late 2016)  and went to the doctor the next morning for a referral to a psychologist along with some sort of temporary medication to help me sleep  and I haven't spoken to her since. And with all my anxiety i'm afraid to even talk to her because its been over a month and she probably thinks I’m a rude douchebag but then again she may not even think twice about it. My sister said she knows I have a lot going on in my life at the moment so she probably doesn’t mind. I felt like I got attached to her way too quickly after that night, or perhaps attached to the idea of potentially being with someone? Since it had been so long since I’ve actually had that physical connection with someone it was quite difficult to just ‘let go’ and forget about it. I became afraid of this attachment and decided to stop talking to her to detach myself, I didn’t want to come across as needy or obsessive. Couldn’t stop thinking about her for 2 weeks afterwards. Avoiding talking to her ended up making me think of her more. She hasn’t messaged me since I didn’t reply to her last message so as far as she’s concerned she may not even think about me at all? When I was younger I used to talk to girls day  and night (not exactly proud of it) but my point is I had confidence, I wasn't anxious or insecure - like I’m too afraid to even message Mary? I just feel awkward after hooking up with her, when I went to her place  and added her on FB I was so awkward around her, didn’t know how to act around her after hooking up  and being so f*cked from the drugs lol - I just want to be able to talk to her and get to know her,  and i don’t really feel like getting to know her through text is how I want to do it either, I’d rather do it in person. But then I’m awkward in person after hooking up lol, don’t how to be. Don’t know what to do, she keeps popping in my head. Feel like I’m not worthy enough, not enough self worth  and confidence. No job, no car, no license, no friends, what do I have to offer? I lift weights, I’m fit, I’m healthy, I’m intelligent, I’m educated, own my own business, I feel like I’m attractive - definitely not ugly, but can barely bring myself to message her on Facebook. Am I just mentally stuck on this whole thing? Do I need to let it go  and move on? I know the next move would be to reach out to her again  and eventually ask to meet up in person  and go from there. But my social anxiety is stopping me. I feel like there is a lot that has gone unsaid between us that should be spoken about  and idk if thats me overthinking it but I don’t even know how to bring that up to her either. I feel so weird thinking all of this when I barely know her. I just don’t know what to do, or how to ask her how she feels about the whole thing cos apparently she got out of a year long relationship herself  and according to my sister ‘she probably isn’t looking for anything’. So as far as Mary is concerned it may have just been a one time thing to hook up on New Years; I don’t know her well enough to make that judgement and don’t feel comfortable enough to talk to my sister about it anymore cos I told her about getting attached and she made me feel like a complete idiot for being like that. Idk if it was because I was on MDMA (I know it dissolves boundaries  and you generally have a better connection with other people, the ‘love drug’, very euphoric) but I was drawn to her in a way I have never experienced before (before taking the MDMA), normally I'm sexually attracted to girls like yeah I find her attractive but that's not what drew me too her - idk how to explain it. Like a deeper connection? I don’t want to say like a soul mate, but I’ve never felt a connection like this with a person before? But then again it could be a superficial connection with the drugs. I really have no idea! Any opinions/advice/guidance would seriously be appreciated so much! I have no one to talk to about this. I got about a 1/3 way through the story with my psychologist in todays session  and it’s just eating me up inside! I want to get out of this mental rut!

One went well enough that the girl invited me back to her place after some drinks but when I got there I freaked out thinking that she wasn't going to like me and while we were watching netflix on her bed I fell asleep. I was embarrassed and didn't ask her out again and after that I didn't go out with someone for about a year. I transferred colleges back closer to home and started hanging out with one of my old friend's little sister since we both went to the same school. I eventually got feelings for her and when I told her she said she was seeing this guy she was hooking up with. I got super down and felt like she didn't like me at all but we still hung out all the time last summer. Also after getting rejected by I decided to lose a bunch of weight dropping from 210 down to 170 pounds bc I felt self conscious about my weight.

I also kept thinking about how to make a move but I would just get super freaked out about the whole thing because I wasn't sure how to make a move without bringing up my feelings. Yet again I was in bed with a girl I liked but could not do anything about it because the first two relationships I was in ended with my rejection by them. She then started to see that guy and they started to date each other but in February they broke up for a 2nd time. We started to hang out more after they broke up and 2-3 weeks ago we started to go out once or twice a week. We went to a bar and then went to a park later that week.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'Up  and Out, Not Down  and In. Over the more than 20 years that I battled social anxiety before finally overcoming it, I developed the concept of “up and out, not down and down and in”. This sounds simple but it was incredibly effective. It was a little reminder I would give myself that I applied specifically to my gaze and body language in order to turn around any situation where I could feel myself becoming very socially anxious and potentially losing control and spiralling into a full-blown anxiety attack or “episode”. Having had SA for most of my life, I developed a very intimate relationship with it and one of the most interesting things I noticed about it, was that it has most power when not faced - either figuratively or literally. I found it was most potent when left to wreak havoc in that space just out of the corner of your eye or mind’s eye. That couple you can kind of see out of the corner of your eye in the coffee shop and can hear laughing, but are too anxious to turn to look at - you just \"know\" they are laughing at you. You start to feel awkward and you become certain they are giggling more at how conspicuously uncomfortable you are becoming. The book you were originally reading, you are now only using as a prop as a place to fix your eyes. You can feel your thoughts starting to race and feel yourself spiralling towards an anxiety attack. You just \"know\" they can see your excruciating awkwardness and your redness and sweating starting to build, and are delighting in it with those shrill laughs. That person you see coming towards you on the pavement. You’ve only taken a quick glance from 30 yards away, but you can just immediately \"tell\" that it’s that person that used to bully you at school. Your heart explodes and you start to feel it pumping in your neck - not just your chest. You feel sick from the adrenaline. Your head drops, your shoulders round over. Pull out your phone and pretend to take a call so you can turn around? Cross the street? Look at the ground, look at the ground, walk as fast as you can. Let’s just get through this. Why the hell does this kind of stuff always happen to me? Any of this sound familiar? In these (perceived) stressful situations your gaze drops submissively downwards, your attention turns inwards to your own racing thoughts and heartbeat, and your body begins to curl up into a defensive ball - shoulders come up to the ears as if to protect yourself from an imminent blow, arms fold across the chest and the head drops. It was at exactly such moments that I would remind myself of “up and out, not down and in”. As I felt my body and thoughts being crushed by the weight of what I believed was happening around me in situations like those above, I would deliberately push back against it. I would bring my head and gaze up, sit upright, take a deep breath and stretch as if I was uncomfortable from sitting too long, push out my chest and turn my awareness outwards. As I stretched, as if yawning, I would take a good look around the room. And when I did, I found something incredible happened... I found that these nightmare-ish scenarios that I thought were unfolding around me existed as mere phantoms in the corner of my eye and mind’s eye - in my physical and mental peripheral vision as it were. When I turned to look at what was really happening it was as if the scales fell from my eyes and I was awoken from a bad dream. Where I imagined terrible demons looming up, there were only pleasant everyday people, going about their lives. The couple in the coffee shop were a pair of young lovers, so into each other and canoodling so much they hadn’t even noticed me, let alone given a f*ck about what I was doing. The guy walking toward me on the pavement wasn’t that guy from school 20 years ago. I had just managed to project my worst fears onto him and make his face morph into someone else. Amy Cuddy has talked at length about the link between posture and mind, and I find that this “making myself big” brings about an immediate change in me mentally. It is effectively a way of striking a “power pose” and this change in physical state brings about a change in the mind and body - even changing hormone levels! It’s as if I am physically throwing off the pressure which I had been allowing to build up on me, which in turn was shrinking my posture down physically into a weaker and more submissive pose. This then becomes a downward spiral as submissive body language feeds into ever more negative thoughts...and on and on. As I look around the room in such instances or face the person I was worried about, I turn myself from a feeling of the passively observed to potent observer. The gaze is a very powerful thing and can be used very effectively in dealing with social anxiety. In the coffee shop example, as I look around, I see normal people doing their own thing - reading books, listening to podcasts, scrolling through their phones - not the rows of judging faces pointing and laughing at me that I had let build up in my mind’s eye. This technique can be used in any anxiety-inducing situation where you have enough space to avoid yourself shrinking down under the weight of your anxious thoughts. Even if speaking in public or another situation where you feel scrutinised and unable to make exaggerated movements there are still changes you can make to bring about the same effect. For example, if speaking in public you can strike a power pose by widening your stance, leaning forward with both hands on the lectern and bringing your chin up. You can also scan the room to engage people individually with eye contact. In this way, the blurry sea of judgemental “audience” “out there”, becomes individuals with their own features and expressions. I also use it a lot on buses, trains and airplanes where I would find walking past rows and rows of seated passengers while I looked for a seat very stressful. But I find this is most effective on the subway, which i historically found a very stressful and anxiety-inducing environment. The more I would be sucked down into looking at my phone or book (which i was only pretending to engage with because I was becoming anxious - and increasingly so the more I believed people were starting to notice how uncomfortable I was) the more my thoughts would race, the redder I would get and the greater the feeling of losing control and spinning into an anxiety attack was.The spell could only be broken by “up and out, not down and down and in” - looking up, posturing up and turning my attention outwards. On subway trains now I spend a lot of the time enjoying the luxury of leisurely looking around the carriages. I try not to stare at anyone as I’m sure there are many people there with their own self-consciousness and anxiety issues that don’t want any unwarranted excessive attention. But I do enjoy the newfound ability to let my gaze roam around, register people’s faces and see that no one is out to get me or laugh at me or judge me.

I used to not make any eye contact with anyone outside and when I would come home, I would feel horrible and start to kick myself because of it. I would feel like I was missing out on life and would feel sad. I broke this habit by telling myself before going outside, \" some eye contact, even if it\\'s awkward, is better than no eye contact.\" For girls, I notice that when a cute girl comes into my line of sight I get nervous and shy away. I would look anywhere expect for them. This has been a automatic reaction for awhile, and I would feel like coward afterwards. I manually had to change this behavior. So before going outside I\\'ll tell myself \" Some eye contact with girls, is better than no eye contact.\" Last tip I can give is posture. I imagine my back against a wall when I am walking.

I\\'m no pro and I still get nervous but it has got way better than a couple months back, when I didn\\'t make any eye contact.

My friend was there with her bf and her other friend. We got along rather well. Sure enough the 4 of us got bored and went to do our own thing. Her friend lets call her \"eve\" (lol) and i danced and drank a bit. I kinda broke out into salsa or similar and started holding hands with her damcing around. I dunno what was going through my mind (other than alco) but i did find her cute (she was indian or similar) we grinded a little as well and kept saying stupid things to one another about the place and i kept making sure not to charge across her boundaries but also break the touch barrier.. we held hands while dancing heaps. my two other friends left early and i took this chance to ask her to go for a walk.. sure enough we did and we ate shitty fast food on the way back to where ahe was staying.. at the top of the stairs i had to give her back her shoes (i was carrying them because they hurt her feet) i asked her if she wanted her shoes back and she said \"maybe, is that what you want?\" i said \"idk maybe its not\" she said \"maybe you want something else\" i said \"maybe i do\" we smiled and she leant in for a kiss snd i met it. We made out for a little bit and i said \"thats more like it\" we did it again and i hugged her around her lower back.. i told her that was my first kiss and she was kinda shocked.. then she told me hers and how it was weird. We kept talking and we kissed again. Then we said we have to go on a date. Then added each other on fb. I left with her and then we said goodbye. Whatever happens now doesnt bother me.

I'm a quiet person, I don't go out clubbing and drinking, I quite frankly hate that, the problem being I don't know where to meet girls my age. I know even if I went out drinking/ clubbing I would not find the kind of person I would want to be around at all. I know what kind of person I like... quiet, like me, someone I can talk and laugh about anything with and just be myself and they can be themselves. Up until the last year I didn't really think about this, I wasn't an adult, I was more bothered with messing around with my friends and doing my uni work. But now I feel really empty, I know I just want a woman in my life. I've missed 2 opportunities where the right person came along in the last 6 years to be with girls I liked because I didn't realize I liked them until it was too late and they had already found other guys (like soulmates) I know I was immature and didn't realise what was happening.

As part of a New Years resolution, I decided I was going to start saying yes to events instead of being cozied up at home all the time. I should note that I’ve been homeschooled through K-12, hence never having walked in a classroom. I won’t lie, I was really nervous leading up to, and partly during the event. I played some indie folk music on the way to try to soothe my nerves. As soon as I pull my car over the hill with the intersection, I witnessed just what I’d be getting myself into. Cars were everywhere. It was a real turn out. There were over 200 people in attendance. I find a parking spot at another building, and I’m just thinking of home. Home where I don’t have to worry about sounding stupid or accidentally having a social faux pas. I push out my chest and walk towards the line. I wasn’t expecting a line. So I mozy on to the back of the line, occasionally looking at my phone so I would blend in with most of the high school kids that were there (I’m 19 with a full beard who is out of the loop on current technology). I couldn’t get a WiFi connection, so I was just switching between settings and the browser the whole time, hopefully looking like I was doing something. The line crawls, and I’m just switching between looking up and at my phone. I make it to the walk up registration, and tell them my name and what not. It seems like it went ok. I walked up and just found the quickest seat I could so I wouldn’t have to be seen walking up by everyone. I sit down and immediately this dude asks if I play vidya games. So I tell him I play fortnite. He starts asking if I watch this particular twitch streamer, I say no. The conversation kind of fizzles out after. Wondering if I seemed boring? Moments later I hear him say to one of his friends “you want to get drunk later?”. At that moment I’m having a little bit of a culture shock. I’ve never drank alcohol. Does everyone booze in HS? I felt kind of uncomfortable. Finally the presentation begins. It’s pretty basic, and I could have got more information from the website. There is a point during the presentation where they play this website quiz game from the school. I can’t partake because my WiFi won’t work, so I just watch the results. I would have got most of them wrong if I tried. Yikes. I was taking notes, but not paying attention to the right stuff evidently. So after that, the whole room is being split off into tour groups. I am paying full attention because I don’t want to screw up and go off with the wrong group. Thankfully I do get the right one. At this point I’m standing alone with a bunch of strangers. Most are with someone else. The tour seems to go fine, there were these three really obnoxious teenagers who were fucking off for the most part though. They didn’t bother me thankfully. Our tour ends and it’s on to the last event (which I wasn’t aware of until later.) Its basically a few different stands promoting different fields of study and social events (almost none of which pertained to my major of choice or my personal interests.) I talk to a few of them anyways. I won’t lie, it was really awkward. I kept tripping over my words, speaking in broken English, and my mind went completely blank a few times while in the middle of conversations. I honestly wonder if this hurt my chances of being enrolled. I didn’t have many good questions either. Afterwards I sat at a table and fidgeted on my phone, then I realized it was for the most part over, and a wave of calm came over me. I realized I could leave! Since I didn’t have anyone to talk to, what was the point of staying any longer? So I walked a long walk back to my car and headed home. That was it. Only part worth it was touring the campus honestly. Well it wasn’t a perfect attempt at integrating into society, but it’s progress nonetheless. I’m proud that I did this instead of wondering what it would have been like at home. It was awkward and I didn’t connect with anyone. I’m afraid more will follow when I do (eventually) enroll there. I just thought I’d share his with anyone of you who is afraid of getting out of the house and in public. I still feel like an out of touch geriatric alien, but hopefully I made some progress. **TL;DR** Went to a preview day at my local community college.

Hopefully someone will read through and offer some advice or likeness. Okay, so I have been someone who suffers from social anxiety since I was about 8. Before that I was actually very outgoing and was social at my preschool/first grade/second grade. Many things contributed to my social anxiety and thus my life long battle of depression. The first notable thing was my teachers bullying me for having ADHD and telling me I was too disruptive. The second notable thing was my best friend in second grade ended up ignoring me because the popular girl in the class disliked me as I was very active and bubbly. So, that\\'s some backstory, and ever since then I have been an internet recluse. Everytime I tried to make friends they used me and then bullied me verbally and mentally until at 13 I quit going to school and outside completely. Internet gaming, specifically MMOs is all I\\'ve had since. Fast forward, I am now nearing 22. I go to college, have a job, and a boyfriend of nearly 5 years. Everything on that aspect is fine (or better than expected for now) but...I fucked myself over socially. When I was 16 I made a friend group despite my social anxiety. The internet is easier to socialize on for me, even though I still can\\'t order a pizza over the phone or make a Dr. Appointment irl. I\\'ve had these friends since 16 for a very stable period, but last year I had a complete social anxiety attack and went haywire. I removed everyone, blocked them, and vanished for 2 months. I tried to come back and explain what happened, but no one was having it. One friend who was very close, even responded \"lol good\" when she heard I was struggling. I tried to reach out people to ask why I was being treated this way and they would get mad at each other for telling me something and then I got backlash for trying to reconnect and put the pieces of my social life back together. This has been extremely debilitating for me and I have relapsed to my pre-social ways. I apologized and told them I\\'d stop bothering them, to which they never responded to except that they didn\\'t need the drama. What bothers me most is that to make these friends, I put myself out there and listened to when THEY were upset. I specifically remember two of them were genuinely suicidal and I talked them through their troubles. One of them said she won\\'t speak to me because I am only trying to talk to her because no one else will and I need someone. Well....yeah. Is this not what normal friends do? Anyways, I apologized to them all and removed them because I was only a bother and annoying. I keep having small breakdowns and it\\'s leaking out in my relationship and work. Today at work the assistant manager seen me act very atypical and asked me if I was okay to which I kind of laughed in a hollow tone and said no and walked away. Everyone at work noticed and I started having an anxiety attack mid rush (I work at a pizza place so it can get work heavy on weekends). What do I do now? Has anyone else experienced this and has found a way to cope or just experienced this in general? I want to make new friends...but I just feel like a teen again and like everyone hates me.

Most of them are around 16 years old. When I tell most people I am 14, they are very suprised. Ive had a few people over the internet guess im 19-25 by the sound of my voice.

Im 16, male, suffer from GAD since I was 3 yo got diagnosed with it when I was 8 or 9. This past summer I saw many changes with my behaviour and thought they were normal, because of puberty and such. Now Im sure it isnt just puberty. Today I went to the store to buy a new pair of earbuds, mine broke and listening to music helps with my anxiety. I was on foot and during the 7 mimute walk to the store I was starting to get sweaty, I was thinking what to say to shop assistant and I was afraid of someone recognising me and I had to make a small talk with them. I get to the store, a big one inside a mall. I get there and the first thing I see were the earbuds, but they werent those that I wanted, searched and couldnt find the earbuds that I wanted, I wanted to get as quickly as possible so I grabbed one of those and headed towards the counter to buy them. The shop assistant was talking to 2 women and I was afraid of interrupting them, I give the earbuds to another shop assistant that was next to the other shop assistant that was talking to the women. He was doing something else but I put the earbuds on top of the counter without saying anything, the guy saw that I wanted to buy the ear buds and gave them to the lady that was talking to the women. The woman was slowlying writting on the keyboard with 2 fingers and talking to the women, during this, I was sweating and shaking, and I was looking at the store, I saw the earbuds that I wanted on my right and I had missed them when I was first looking for the earbuds. I take one of the earbuds and placed them on top of the counter, the shop assistant didnt see the earbuds that I wanted on top of the counter, I had to talk to the shop assistant that I wanted to change the product, few words, was quick and quiet while shaking and sweating. She did what she had to do and I took the money out of my wallet shaking to give the lady. I put them in my backpack and walk, almost running to home thinking that I was way too akward and that they saw me shaking and sweating, got home and started writting this. I go the shrink about my GAD but never mentioned my anxiety while on these situations. Im too afraid, my parents judge me for not hangging out much with my peers, they compare me to them when they were my age and I sometimes get grounded because they think that I am additcted to my pc and phone, which I am not, and that addiction is making me hang out less with my friends. My shrink knows my parents really well, she was my dad's shrink for when he had depression, it was on that time that I was diagnosed with GAD. At the end of each session my shrink talks to my dad or my mom about the session amd Im afraid my parents will judge me after the session, at home. What should I do?

            "{'sequence': '(\\'Everyone hates me and what I\\'ve learned from it. This is going to be a weird post and hopefully it fits here well. I never thought of this as a social anxiety, but it actually is kind of, correct me if I\\'m wrong I\\'m new to Reddit. I\\'ve been hated. Even since preschool. Not by my family by all means, and people liked members of my family by the way. It seemed like people only outside of my family hated me. Strangers, classmates, coworkers, anyone I came into contact with besides my family hates me. I was always the quiet one and the weird one. I never minded either. I fed off of their hate. Anytime I got bullied I would fight back. Like you know when they say fight or flight? Yea I was the fighter. I would lash out and do exactly what they did to me. Or I would cry and show them exactly how it made me feel right then and there, almost as a joke but filled with rage. I didn\\'t really get embarrassed. I was really good at doing embarrassing things and be okay with it most of the time. I preferred to be alone. I never liked it When people tried to become my friend. Like why are you texting me and calling me? Please leave me alone. For some reason I did actually become friends with the other unliked kid. I would see people snicker at them and see them as weird. Here\\'s a little story: There was one girl in middle school. Her name was Jane. She had long black hair, pale skin and bright hazel eyes. The kids were literally afraid of her and thought she was weird I wasn\\'t afraid of her and I was fascinated in her. I also felt empathy for her. I could relate to her of being unliked. End of short story. Weird part about enjoying being alone is I\\'ve always had a boyfriend since the beginning of high school. The boyfriends were always cool and well liked by others. The boyfriends were all similar in their own ways, we all broke up mutually, calmly and on good terms. The boyfriends all gave me respect, friendship and trust. The cool boys always liked Jane as well and she always had a cool boyfriend too! Other boys thought we were the \"funniest, raddest, coolest, best to be around\" chicks out there. Or so they say. So I guess what I should have said in the beginning of this entire post is, most girls hate me. So truth be told, not everyone hates me. This has been a lie for my whole life. I believed as a small child up until early adulthood is that everyone hated me was far from the truth. One day I had enough. I tried to kill myself. Slit my wrists and wanted to bleed out. Well it didn\\'t work, I didn\\'t die and I should have gotten stitches. So I decided that day I will never try again left with awful scars. I still hated my life and the fact everyone hated me. I fell again in these ideas I created. Sure there was hard proof for people hating me. They hated the way I looked, the way I dressed, my hair. They spread rumors, they prank phone called me, tried to best me up. I had a girl send me a 10 page text message saying I lie about every story I ever told her . The words this girl said to me hurt me deeply. I cried and cried. I worked with her and I had to face her. I was terrified of her and I wondered \"why me\" It was a pattern. Some girls simply just didn\\'t like me. There was nothing I could say or do any differently. You might be thinking, \"there has got to be a reason why people hate me.\" The only thing I can think of to answer that thought, would be that I am totally myself. I don\\'t sugar coat shit. I\\'m honest and I like to share ideas and past expieriances. So here is a little description about me to paint a better picture. I try hard with things I do. I really enjoy practicing different skills and hobbies that strike my interest suddenly such as painting, playing instruments, gymnastics, yoga, hiking, biking, dog training, cooking, singing and more. If something interests me I try it. You could say I\\'m a go getter. At the same time I\\'m laid back, I\\'m quiet and a keep to myself person. Other times I am wacky and weird. I sing and dance to myself, I talk to myself. I do weird things. I make jokes and I laugh at things. I am over the spectrum of things. I am ever changing. I am confused but I am aware. I am always looking around me and thinking people are planning things. I avoid people. Other times I truely care about people. I love people and I love seeing their talents. I want to get to know them and I listen to them. I always see people and notice their intentions. You could say I am observant. But all of this I still enjoy being alone. I guess I live a balanced life. I\\'m also a Libra and my life seems to match up to those horoscopes most of the time to also paint a picture of myself. So instead of rambling on and on and on as I\\'m surprised if anyone is even still reading this, I\\'m going to get straight to the point. I\\'ve learned a lesson in life and it is difficult to grasp!! The lesson is, no one actually truely cared about me all along but myself. It was me all along that cared too much about what people thought. It was my reactions towards situations that hurt me and made me think people hate me. I have to come to terms that I am simply an imperfect human being with odd characteristics as everyone else! We are all so unique and in our own little worlds. We all work differently and that\\'s how we all fit together just as a puzzle and how each piece is unique and all work together. Sometimes it takes a while for the pieces to come together and sometimes they seem to fit but they don\\'t really work well and you can\\'t actually fit them perfectly. Sometimes different pieces in the puzzle need to be as far away as possibly to work perfect and help complete the picture. It is okay to not get along with everyone but when they show their dislike I need to keep calm and carry on. What I mean by our own little worlds is, everything around us is determined by our own judgements and the way we see things around us. We all see things differently, our brains work differently and you can clearly see we are all different so that proves our own little worlds. We all automatically look out for our own well being. So my whole life I was thinking too hard about what people thought of me. Once someone expressed their slight 2 second care about me, my reaction made me believe that everyone hated me. It was a delusion. I had a chain reaction because once I believed everyone hates me my actions and reactions more than likely changed that held characteristics that are easy to dislike by other people. Hopefully out of all of this rambling is that I can continue to realize these thoughts of mine and start to have a better attitude towards life. I hope I can bring light and new helpful ideas to the world. I strive to be the best I can for myself and others. I will react to others even when they do me wrong as a calm and collected individual. I will handle my fight instinct as a normal human in complete control. I will continue to just be myself and let others be themselves.\\')', 'labels': ['not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect', 'related to an outdoor space with negative effect'], 'scores': [0.35693877935409546, 0.22809045016765594, 0.22339358925819397, 0.19157713651657104]}\n",

Tuesday I left my house with the intent of going but about midway through I just started panicking and instead walked around the city so my family didn\\'t start suspecting of anything.

In high school I had 2-3 really close friends including my main best friend lets call her BFF, and a bunch of other friends mainly just people I talked to and hung with in school and class but was never truly close with. So my bff and I were super close all of high school until about the end of march when she basically ditched me for a new group of friends she made. We would still talk and I was her “best friend” but once she started hanging out with her new friend group she never included me, stopped telling me about important thing going on in her life, etc and overall just acting really snobby and conceited. I ended up confessing to one of the other girls I was really close with what was happening, and she was by my side and supported me. My bff and I ended up talking everything through and were good but things didn’t really change. She kept hanging out with them at all times never including me and when I did hang with them (once) she barely spoke to me the entire time. After we graduated she had two weeks in our city before she had to go away and start summer semester at a college far away but still in the same state. She spent the whole two with her new friend group and only gave me one day to hang out 3 days before she had to leave. During this time I was at my dad’s house and was so pissed that she would do this to me that I was not going to leave my dads house just so she could see me when she had all this time to and didn’t. Summer goes along and we didn’t talk not even once. At this point in my life I had decided to start school in the spring to give myself some time because I felt that I needed it and my only two friends were the girl that helped me out with my bff and her best friend who was also my friend. The entire summer we barely hung out. After summer we hung out a couple times but they were all super boring. I’m personally very outgoing and a hyped up type of person when I’m around people I feel comfortable with. They would just sit there and not want to do anything fun or engaging. I don’t mean get drunk and party all night, but like go makeup shopping or play fun stupid games, go out to eat, talk about boys, go shopping, go to the beach, or in general anything besides like going to one of their houses and playing nintendo wii. Plus on top off all this they were very judgy and would look at me weird for saying something outside of the box. When I would ask one of them about the boys in the college I was going to go to in the spring she would be dry and uninterested. Then in October I got a job, and I really like the place I work at. When we would hang out and I would try to tell them about the people and like the tea going on at work they didn’t care and I would talk and they didn’t respond and I felt like I was talking to my self. All of this plus the fact that since they were each others best friend they wouldn’t include me in a lot of their convos and then bring up things when I was there made me feel really lonely and tired. Eventually was broke the camels back was that drama basically started again with my bff and when I texted them I was just going to text her and end this once and for all they both started sending messages like “oooohhh can’t wait for the tea” or “🐸☕️”, “the tea it hot” and in general things like that. I was so offended because instead of being there for me and supporting me bc they both knew how hurt and emotionally affected I was from the situation between my bff and I all they cared about was the tea and the drama. A month after this happened I cut them off but only talked to one of them. It was the one that helped me in the beginning with my bff. I thanked her for supporting and that I was always going to be grateful for that but that our friend ship was over and I explained to her how they made me feel and basically she texted me back cursing me out and saying a whole bunch of rude shit and I never texted her again. Both of them blocked me on all social media platforms and I have not seen, heard, or talked to them since that day. I started college but online bc I have no transportation to campus so I have no interactions with people my own age and at my job it’s mainly middle aged women and a few young people but not anyone I consider to have a good connection friendship wise with. It gets me so sad to see my ex bff on social media going to parties and having fun, making friends, etc. when I wish I was doing that. Plus just in general watching young people my age having fun and hanging out with their “squad” makes me depressed! Because I want that. Now because of my friendless life and because I have little to no interaction with people my own age in over a year I’m beyond scared to do school on campus so I’ve decided to do all of college online. I’ve definitely gotten a lot anxiety in regards to being social with people my own age and also boys. I’ve never had a boyfriend or even talked to anyone and with my whole lonely no friends no social life situation I’m never going to meet one and if I do, I mentally I’ve already sabotaged myself because I think to myself how embarrassing it would be to meet a boy and when he asks about my friend me tell him that I have none. Like how fucking embarrassing and lame does that sound. So to avoid this Im just not gonna let any potential guy get close enough. Plus I’m insecure about my body bc Im a little chubby but don’t do anything to change this because I have zero motivation. So far the only good things going for me are my job, school, and my immediate family. I get depressed when I think about the fact that I’m so young and I have no friends anyone to hangout with and have normal social interactions with. Like am I really going to waste all of my young years stuck in my house all day and working as much as possible. Sometimes I think that the best I can do is graduate and keep moving up in the company I work for now and become a workaholic and live with my parents until forever.

I have a specific friend who my attention has been on lately because he really doesn't talk that much to me, almost forgot to say hello to me when he arrived to this party (even though that's probably not true, alot of people there to say hello to) I know for a fact that this is like the nicest guy that exist in the world, but my brain is a wierdo so.. Should also add that he is a few steps above acquaintance level. There had been some quite heavily alcohol intake from everyone at this party and sometime during the night me and a friend decide to take a walk around the neighborhood and he decides to come with. I tell my friend about this feeling about him hating me (2nd time, have talked about it before and she says that's not the case). This situation ends up with me deciding it's a great time to tell him how I feel. My friend ends up telling him that I feel this way with my permission (He also doesn't know I have anxiety or any problems btw). He then comes over and of course tells me that's absolutely not the case. I suddenly break down crying and hyperventilating in his arms and we talk it out as best we can (we are alone at this stage). My friend then gets back and in my drunk state I pretty much word vomit out a confusing summary of my history with anxiety and my current state to them. We keep on walking the three of us and he keep comforting me with kind words, small hugs and back touches until we arrive back at the party with me now close to anxiety free. I'm now a little confused about this. I'm honestly glad I told him, it feels like it got rid a little bit of the whole thought about people hating me. I also feel guilty that I brought another person in to my anxiety. I sent him a message this morning apologising about that he had to see that and that I put him in this position, and he said everything was cool and I believe him. I honestly thought I would have more anxiety about this but a big part of me just laughs at this whole situation which is wierd. So this is just a little bit of a vent from a hungover girl.

Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been super shy. I don’t know why. Nothing happened to me as a child, I have a great family and have great friends so I don’t know why I have this debilitating issue. I looked it up, and i learned that sometimes people with an overactive amygdala have a heightened fight or Flight response therefore causing more severe anxiety. So maybe it’s a biological thing for me, but I have thought of anything at all that could have affected me to be like this but nothing comes to mind. Throughout middle school, I haven’t even realized but In seventh grade I was depressed. I don’t think I knew it. I knew I was sad but didn’t know if it went further than that. I don’t remember being suicidal then, but seventh grade was the first time I started to self harm. I was always getting in trouble with my parents, I’ve always felt like they’re out to get me and I never show or receive any affection. Because of this, me and my parents relationships is not the best. and I know it’s my fault. They try to understand why I act certain ways but I don’t even know myself. I wish I had an answer. So anyway, an incident happened in seventh grade where I had to share something with the class. Presentations always scared me and being in front of the class always did. Even if it was a simple yes or no question. I can’t stand being the center of attention and I always cry when I feel this social anxiety coming on. We had to share poems we had written and I just remember being so scared, I just started crying and couldn’t get through it. I remember my classmates faces and they were so confused and I was confused to. I knew it was just a presentation but my body had another idea. To this day I’m not sure if that was my first anxiety attack? and I’m not sure if I’ve ever had an anxiety attack because I never feel like the world is ending I just get so embarrassed I think, that all I can do is cry and my heart starts beating rapidly, and I’m shaking and I just wanna disappear. But do people have anxiety attacks differently? If you know, please help. Anyway, after that happened I was SO mortified I didn’t even want to go back to school. I always assumed people labeled me as the super shy freak girl and wouldn’t want to talk to me anyway so I decided to do virtual school in eighth grade. No one knows that’s the reason I decided to be homeschooled. I just tell everyone “I don’t know just felt like it” when they ask because I don’t want to tell them my embarrassing story. So virtual school actually turned out to be awful and so I ended up starting high school for 9th grade as a freshman. Because I skipped out on 8th grade, I already didn’t have many friends. And the ones I did have, lets call her Lauren. She was my absolute best friend and we ended up having a class together so that was the class I looked forward to. I remember always being isolated in my other classes while everyone else talked and I would be so scared around people and scared that someone would talk to me. I didn’t have many friends that year. I also repeatedly cut and I was developing an addiction. Come sophomore year, I was deeply depressed. My best friend, still Lauren, she glew up. She became popular and gorgeous and it was hard being friends with her sometimes because she had so many friends and guys all over her. I know it wasn’t her fault of course, and through it all she stuck by me and I couldn’t be more grateful to have someone like her to this day. But I can’t Help but feel inferior when I’m with her sometimes. I would always think “people are probably wondering why she’s friends with you” “they just think you’re a charity case” I was so quiet all the time. I honestly don’t remember much of sophomore year. I just remember being sad all the time. I remember drawing sad sketches. I discovered and became obsessed with twenty One pilots, (still my favorite band today and I’m seeing them this year FLOOR TICKETS! can’t wait haha.) so come junior year, I told myself if I wasn’t happier by the end of the year I would kill myself before senior year. I met my other best friend junior year and we are so similar it’s crazy. So greatful for her friendship. Still struggled with self harm. I started to maybe get a little better, or so I thought I was. I got my first job at Burger King, which was not the wisest decision. Smoked weed and got high for the first time. Developed a huge crush on a boy who did nothing but lead me on. It really wrecked me and I don’t think he has any idea of how much to this day. Pierced my nose. I think I kept trying new experiences to feel something, convince myself to stay. I thought it was working but deep down, I was the same. Didn’t self harm as much because it wasn’t as easy to hide anymore. And my mom found out a little later and everything just got a bit crazy. Forced into therapy and parents found a pipe and new I was smoking. They were absolutely furious. I also was caught with a boy over at like 2 am by my mom. Not my finest moment. I think this was definitely my most impulsive year. I started to do things that scared me and that I knew was wrong but I think I was just trying to fill the void I had. One night I decided I had enough and tried to overdose on vistaril. I remember feeling the effects of it and becoming super tired so I thought that was it. I went to bed peacefully. Well, spoiler, I woke up. I was so mad I hadn’t taken enough but I think I was also relieved. I read about liver damage and all that and I decided that if I was going to do it again, I would take enough so I wouldn’t end up in the hospital impaired all my life. So summer before senior year, my best friend, Lauren, invited me to a church camp. I’ve always been a Christian and such but never had a relationship with God. That camp was a turning point for me. I met so many people and developed so many friendships and it opened my eyes to a life I wanted to live. And for the first time, I felt like I had support. People who were there for me and like I had God. But my depression still didn’t go away. I was still sad. So so sad. One of the hardest things I’ve ever done, is opened up and told my feelings of depression and suicidal ideation to. One night at the camp, it was the last night and we were all in this big room sharing stories or just venting things we needed to get off of our chest. Telling people things we needed prayer for. I told everyone In that room, maybe 60 people, my plans of killing myself. How I was going to before senior year but that this camp changed my mind. And I could barely get through it without crying. After that, a lot of people came to hug me and tell me to stay strong and that they were there for me. It was an amazing and cool experience. But I started attending church with her and becoming stronger in my faith and I connecting with amazing people. I went to Guatemala in 2017 on a mission trip and it was an amazing experience. Everything was as good as could be. I just wanted to be done with High school and done with my past there. I was ready for college and what life had for me. I can’t believe it, but I was dare I say hopeful. I felt guilty for being anxious and depressed as a Christian though. It of course, was no where as near as bad as it was but I still woke up and felt that same emotionless i felt for so long and tiredness. Soon enough, I just accepted it. People think that because I have Jesus now that I’m okay. But inside I am still hurting and depressed. I think about suicide almost everyday but I would never act on it. I know God is there for me and would never want me to do this, his plans are always greater. And I believe that, I do. I went to Montreal on a mission trip this past November and it was awesome. I love helping people and showing gods love and although it’s hard to connect with people sometimes due to social anxiety, i know I’ll get through it. But still depression lingers. I worked at chick fil a for a bit but quit due to anxiety and the amount of people there and all. I try daily to get back up. I need a job but I’m scared to get one just to become over whelmed and quit again. I keep letting people down. I still want to die. I wish I could just go peacefully. I feel like a ghost among the living and I’ve always felt like something Is wrong with me. I’m on meds and I always dream of overdosing but I could never. I have a tattoo dedicated basically saying “this may suck but God’s still got you”. It’s “And if not, he is still good”. I got that tattoo and wrote my testimony about having social anxiety and living through it. I feel like a hypocrite for feeling like I want to die still. I always encourage others and tell them that it does get better and to hold on and I hope they believe me when I say it and can’t see behind my mask. I think I believe it when I say it to them. But for some reason my mind makes me believe that I will never succeed and I’m bound to live a purposeless life. Everyday I wake up and I say just another day to exist. Just doing my classes and occasionally meeting up with friends. I feel like I’m lying to them. No one knows how I feel am I’m ashamed to tell them. I don’t want them to take pity on me and I don’t want to treated like I’m going to break if they touch me. I am in a new relationship. My first boyfriend, and he is the sweetest most amazing thing. But I’m scared to tell him how I feel. I warned him of my depression and anxiety but I didn’t tell him the extent of it. He doesn’t know I self harm. Which I did for the first time in about 6 months yesterday. He saw and I told him it was the cat. Lame excuse and I don’t think he bought it. I’m torn between scared of telling him and him not wanting to deal with this or just tell him because he was going to leave anyway. either way I lose. it’s best to be honest right? Anyway.

            "{'sequence': \"('My story. Includes social anxiety, body dysmorphia and incel. English is not my native language, so u can read some weird words. I will try to ´´summarize´´ this (at the bottom, there is a real summary). As a child, when i was around 11, i was really attractive to everyone. I know this because at school, i got all the girls chasing me, and so outside. Obviously, i was too young to ´´benefit´´ on this. At that age, i remember myself as an outgoing kid, that had friends and did some regular stuff. Later on, something happened. I think that the inflection point was the haircut that i started wearing, the classic mushroom haircut that a lot of kids wear...with the difference that i was a teenager already. From being a young Adonis, i started to hear the mock of some girls, through the nicknames that they put on me, refered to my haircut. All my friends started having some interactions with girls, while i was just staring, too afraid of rejection. That was the beginning of my fearful existence, and it continued (with ups and downs) until my current age of 25. So yeah, right now i feel like i didnt live at all. I never had a girlfriend, i only have 1 friend that i meet every few months, i never had a job and never been to a party. This decade has been a mix of playing World of Warcraft, doing sport (cycling and calisthenics, obv individual sports), and studying some random useless shit that my mother suggested me to. I feel like it doesnt matter what i study, since there is people in almost every single profession. Ive studied hostelry and quitted it cos its too customer-facing. Ive studied sport and physical activity animator...but it was only because i like to practice it, im too insecure for teaching or doing anything in fron of a group. Now i switched to programming...but seems that im too autistic even for the nerd-world, since the teacher already told me that i have to learn to participate more while working in a groupal project...but i just end up excluding myself. Sport is what saved me through all this time. When im at home, i cant stop thinking about the past and the future, and i listen a lot of depressing music. So i need to take a ride on my bike almost every day. Im prety good at it and its hard to think about random shit when you are under big physical effort. I consider myself a good interlocutor, but i only can show this in individual conversations. In a group (specially if i dont know the members), im unable to articulate a single word unless someone ask my oponion directly. This is hard for me, because everybody that ever meet me, told me that im a very witty person and i can contribute to the conversation. Im really quick at making word games. Somebody once told me that i should try rap battles. And i would...if i could articulate a fucking word in front of groups of strangers -.-º. Because of this witty personality, i know that people want me in their groups, and i got invited to random plans and parties many times...but always refused. I just cant stop thinking about little details that throw me back: what if i have to dance, what if they wanna take photos, what if my clothes are not suitable...And so, for me, saturday is just another weekday to play WoW and do some sport... I once challenged myselft to go to a psychologist. Since the first session was free and it was one to one conversation, i thought i had no excuse. It went pretty well, she got really interested in me, because we talked for an hour and a half (the session had one hour) and she even invited me to come for another free session and to pay whatever amount i could for the next ones. Not to vary, i rejected... As to relationships, ive always been on this dating webs, but it has been useless because my profile photos sucks. I hate being photographed, i dont want to recognize myself on the pics(i think im much better in person) .I always have the same 3 pics from a specific angle and blurry. I consider myself pretty good at flirting, but if the profile pic is not attractive, u wont get the chance to start a conversation. And so, i didnt meet a single girl this way. Well...i actually met one. It was on a social anxiety forum. We exchanged numbers. I could see her picture, but she couldnt see mine, so everything was ok xD. She was really pretty, which surprised me(even more, when i discovered that she had like 1k followers on IG). We chatted for a week straight, it was amazing. One day, she asked me to meet in real life, which is really hard for me, but after those conversations, i thought there was feeling between us, so i accepted. We met in a bar. She was really beautiful irl, but not as perfect as in those IG pics, which i liked even more. At first, we were kinda nervous, but the beer made its effect and we talked for hours.It was getting late and she suggested me to pass the night in my house. Im naive, but i think i know what this kind of proposition means...Still it was a terrible idea, cos i live with my mom. Dont know how and why, i ended up accepting. Before arriving to my house, i thorowed up(cos i smoked, and that makes me sick most of the times). Once in my house, my mom woke up...Well, we ended up sleeping on the same bed, but nothing could have happened cos i was too wasted X_X. Surprisingly, she wanted to keep meeting with me, and we met one more time, a few months later. The most remarkable about this one, is that we kissed. It was a really quick and cold experience, so i dont even consider it as i ever kissed. The fact that she kissed me (obv it was she who went for it) without passion, meant a lot for me. The next day, i told her to break up, because i was getting feelings, and she told me that she only was looking for friendship. She insisted in meeting again, but i rejected. That was the last time i had something with a girl, two years ago. And this is how i learned that u cant have social anxiety and 1k followers on IG by posting pics of your body. Ive cried a lot after that break up, and now im again on that numb state that everything is bad, but not enough to cry... How do i know that i have body dysmorphia. Simple: because im the supreme textrovert. I feel very secure when it comes to written comunication (more on my native language). I consider myself good at flirting (i know how to tease) and i use to troll a lot (even whole groups of people), specially the people that cry about their situation or blame others. Everything is ok as long as they dont see a picture of me. One really strange thing is that, in videogames, i never been able to speak through a microphone, which is a requirement for doing a lot of fun stuff. So i ended up being a loner even in videogames. Add that to my completism (im obsessed with achieving everything that is achievable in the games (and irl too)). Overall, i think i have a really great body, specially because i practiced several sports for more than ten years, Im 1.85 height, 70kg with very lean muscles and long legs. My hair is of an amazing quality and my haircut now is an upgraded version of the mushroom style that i think began everything xD. It makes me look younger. I dont like a lot of things about my face, but i think it has some personality. And down there, im slightly over the average. On the other hand, lets talk about what i dont like and what keeps me locked in this mental prison. I dont like my short arms, it makes me feel inferior in some sports (i feel like i have to be the best in everything). I actually started thinking that people with short arms are doomed, or something like that :/. I dont like my nose and how it looks when i smile (thats why i never smile in photos) I dont like how my hair looks when its wet, and the fordyce spots on my lips. I got the fordyce spots down there, too. They are harmless small white sebaceous bumps under the skin. Despite being well endowed, i focus more on the spots and the form of my D, which i dont like neither. Ive been watching porn for more than ten years, and it changes yourself physically and mentally. I cant stop comparing myself to the men that appear on the videos. I know almost everything about my conditions and my ´´flaws´´, because ive been reading shit about them for too long. The conclusion is that there is no magical solution, u just have to accept yourself. I read a lot about spirituality, too. Thats why i know that my goal in this life is to trascend this extreme identification with the body. To kill the ego, to live in the moment...but God, its been more than ten years and i didnt perceive much progress...I even know the techniques (meditation, self love affirmations, etc), but i end up thinking about the bad things. I still have hope, tho, and dont even contemplate suicide, because i would have to learn the lesson on the next life. Jesus, its tooking me the whole weekend to write this...with huge breaks, of course. Im such a perfectionist that i have to think a lot before before writing a line, then rewrite it...and i dont even like the final result. If you made it here: congratulations, you really deserve a prize xD! Here is the summary of this bible. I feel that i have a lot of amazing attributes, Physically im very fit because ive been practicing differen sports for more than ten years. Ive got a strong personality and witty sense of humor, as people say. Im good at flirting, too. But i just can show it. I isolate myself every time, reject invitations to social plans and let go a lot of chaces. I do this because im terrified of other peoples judgements, specially towards my body (in the supreme textrovert). Im very insecure sexually because of the classic fordyce spot issue. Now the real questions. Does anyone identify to this? Did anyone overcome a similar situation or have any advices? Do anyone wanna share his story?

Speaking of college, I have a bachelors degree in English (I know) I am currently unemployed and my last two jobs were in non profit academic advisory roles. I was pretty much a loner and hated school throughout life. I was taken to a therapist when i was 12, and they declared I was \"normal.\" I started questioning life in college and realized it was pretty useless and that it was school and work until you die. I drank liquor i would say the normal amount for a college student. After graduating, I took the two advisory jobs which I hated both jobs due to anxiety. I am not a people person in general and I would sweat profusely when talking to students or even in mildy hot temperatures. I sweat 10x more than others even in the winter. I would sweat in a crowded subway or platform or talking to new people. I spoke to a doctor and I was prescribed robinul and told I had hyperhydrosis. The robinul works so that part of my life is solved temporarily. In addition to this, no matter what allergy medicine I take or what dose, I drip water from my nose and eyes. If I go outside especially in the morning, and its sunny or windy, my eyes water. I get acid reflux and heartburn from tomato sauce, coffee and liquor (all things I love). I also find myself getting extremely angry at the simplest things (people walking slow in the city, etc, to the point where I think about attacking someone in my head.) When I began feeling suicidal at my first job after graduation, I spoke to a therapist again who once again told me I was \"normal\" a \"regular new yorker\". At this point I am at a wits end and speak to another doctor who prescribes me zoloft and other downers. I mix them with alcohol in a excessive amounts to cope with the job I hate. I stop taking the zoloft pretty because they didn\\'t work for me. I was taking to a hospital where people told me i was a handsome man who had things to live for and sat next to a girl with 16 cut marks on her arm and a guy who wanted to start fires with his hands. I did my research before hand and I realized that they would probably give me shock therapy (I don\\'t know how that would help) so I pretended to feel better. Fast forward to today, I am unemployed living off my parent. I work out about three or four times a week, I am about 5\\'11 195. The only problem is I have little to no appetite daily and I am starting to develop a belly. I eat maybe twice a day (where i force myself to eat),I sweat like Patrick Ewing in the fourth quarter if I don\\'t take robinul and i work out 4 times a week So this is unexplainable to me Anyway, I\\'ve had ultrasounds, endoscopy, colonscopy and the gastro doctor stated I was in perfect health and the only theory he has is ibs. As you can see, I\\'ve had a long series of issues in my body and doctors telling me everything is fine and blah blah etc. So I\\'m at a wit\\'s end. I also have gynecomastia in both nipples and it\\'s another obstacle that is annoying to deal with. I\\'m unemployed so I have no insurance to see any more doctors and i just think life is bullshit and I don\\'t want to deal with it. I have a girlfriend, who helps me want to keep living, although she keeps alluding to marriage in kids which I\\'m vehemently against. The only people that stop me from slicing my wrist\\'s are her, my mother, aunt, brother and 3 or 4 friends.

It is nothing fancy, but I was always going straight back home after lectures to study so I was very rarely interacting with anyone (even if it is just eye contact) and on some days where I had no lectures, I’d be home all day on my computer. This made my social anxiety worse. Almost every day for the past 1-2 months, I have started going to the library and sitting amongst strangers which is something that always made me anxious.

            "{'sequence': \"('My ultimate guide for defeating social anxiety. Hello, I’m a 16 yo male and this is (and probably will be) my only post on this Subreddit. Recently I discovered something great, and I want you to read this post because you’re probably struggling with social anxiety dominating your life like it used to do mine. Remember that „you were born into“ a society. You were raised with patterns to follow. You are scared of breaking these patterns. Scared of breaking out of society. Scared of being rejected by it. Now I want you to differentiate between SOCIETY and HUMANITY. Society is a theoretical construct. A mindset. Society is what has these rules that make you scared of being yourself(„don‘t dress differently“, „don‘t run outside when others see you“ for example.). Humanity are people. Humanity are the people around you and the people you meet. The construct of society and these rules shall not apply for now. In my school bus is always this guy. He enters as one of the last. He‘s probably as old as me. He wears plain black clothes and tries to avoid any eye contact at all. His eyes are dead. When he sits on his seat he doesn‘t even put off his bag from his back. He doesn‘t want to make noise and come off as annoying, even though the bag taking all his space clearly makes him uncomfortable and it bothers him. This guy is affected by society. Not just affected, it‘s dominating all of his actions. Of course noone would give a f*ck if he would just put off his bag, but he still has his made-up rules carved into his mind. This applied to me aswell. Perhaps you may have seen by now that society cares, but humanity clearly doesn’t. Now at one point in the last few days I found a point: „What if I disconnected from all of this?“, „What if I didn‘t care?“. Whenever I am in an anixious situation now, for example walking past a row of cars, I tell myself: „These rules don‘t apply for me now. I‘m free now.“ I‘d like to show you another example. When someone mocks you for being an idiot(let‘s say you just stumbled and fell) and you care about it, you may feel like an idiot. Even worse, you let the bully take control over your emotions. You let him take your soul. Now what if you simply wouldn‘t care? He‘s the idiot now, He keeps mocking about you. But he keeps mocking a god. You are way out of his league now. You don’t care about his existence and his words. Instead of actually feeling like an idiot and feeling he deserves the right to mock you because society says that, he‘s just being a rude child now and you don‘t have to worry about him at all. He‘s still trapped in his little society cage, and you‘re a free and respectable human now. Perhaps maybe you may still think that ignoring society patterns may make you an outsider, and make you end up as a lonely old man/woman without having ever been loved. Think of the most confident man/woman you know. Think of someone harassing him/her. The confident person would never even let the harasser close to affecting its emotions. It doesn‘t have any emotional investment at all in the people around it because society doesn‘t have it caught in its chains. Perhaps maybe the average society-affected person will not like you now, but it will respect you. On the other hand, humanity will not only respect, but love you. Once you disconnect from society you will start to attract many great new people. And it‘s way better than being in the society hole where you have to show heavy commitment everyday in order to not be rejected. I want you to disconnect from society now. Break the patterns, break the barrier. Be comfortable and confident with yourself. This movement doesn‘t take any realistic commitment, I just needs a change in your mind. When you feel anxiety in your actions, don’t care. I don’t want you to demonstrate that you don’t care, I want you to not care. There’s a big difference between showing and doing. You can still be a respectable person and respect other people while not giving a sh*t about the rules of society. I hope I have helped you with this. Keep going. P.S.

Hi everyone, this may be a bit long, but I appreciate anyone who reads even most of this!  and#x200B; Anyway, I\\'m a 24 M living in a big city. And a social anxiety sufferer. My social anxiety isn\\'t physically crippling or physiological -- my physical symptoms are usually pretty limited -- but it\\'s mental and I am an expert in avoidance. I would even say I am a \\\\*very\\\\* social and outgoing person in \"comfortable\" environments (alcohol, bars, sporting events, with friends or people I trust, etc.), but when it comes to \"uncomfortable\" environments including putting myself out there and being alone doing it, I avoid them (joining clubs/sports teams, going to events, meeting new people, talking to people at bars, etc.) altogether.  and#x200B; My social anxiety stems from insecurity and a lack of self-confidence. I wasn\\'t beat up or anything as a kid, but I grew up being bullied, condescended toward, and made fun of for my lack of height at the time -- I was one of the shortest kids in school (I\\'m 5\\'8 now and have not been insecure about this in years) -- and for being skinny and small in general as a man in a society that often sees men like that as weak and a joke. Teachers told me I couldn\\'t audition for roles because of my height, kids my age made fun of me, and adults made snide comments. All of this contributed toward deeply ingraining into my head a fundamental insecurity. I wore sweatshirts during the summer and shirts at the beach because I had terrible body image issues. From the age of like 10. **Long story short, from an early age I was very insecure, had major body image issues, and terrible self-confidence and this contributed greatly to creating my social anxiety.**  and#x200B; **Fast forward to today.** I am still skinny and small and find that the women who are into me tend to be 2-3 years younger usually because I \\\\*do\\\\* look young and small for my age. Dating can be frustrating. But, I am going to the gym, I\\'m starting to feel more confident in my body, and I know that I have had a good amount of romantic opportunities, even if it has never worked out into a relationship. I feel good about myself, have become extremely self-aware of my own insecurities and how I projected them in the past, and in general I am content. But, I still cannot get over the avoidance of social anxiety. It\\'s ingrained into my head.  and#x200B; **It has prevented me from making more friends** in a new city -- the idea of doing a Meetup or joining a club is terrifying to me. And I just avoid doing that kind of thing altogether. **It has prevented me from, say, talking to women at a bar,** \\\\*even in\\\\* a drunken state when I feel good about myself. It just takes over and I tell myself I\\'m not attractive, that I\\'m going to embarrass myself, etc. It has essentially reduced my chances of meeting women to only on dating apps. **And it also has held me back in my career and what I want to do in life**. I\\'m a deeply political person but I can\\'t network. I can\\'t bring myself to go to happy hour\\'s by myself or join political clubs or anything. I simply cannot put myself out there alone into unfamiliar situations. The thought of being awkward or having no one to talk to or being seen as ridiculous or an idiot -- these things fill my head and so avoid these situations altogether.  and#x200B; I don\\'t want to look back five years from now and not have made more friends, not have taken a risk romantically by talking to someone I didn\\'t know, and not have truly tried to pursue my political dreams. I have gone to therapy lately but the appointments are few and far in-between (once a month at best) and while it has helped me become even more self-aware, it has not helped me with, well, changing my brain chemistry. And I don\\'t want to be resigned to thinking this is just how I am going to be. I am missing out on so many opportunities from friends to partners to career/hobbies. **Above all, I am frustrated that I have all the logical solutions to this problem (Who actually cares what people think of you?), but that does nothing for what feels like an innate reaction to unfamiliar situations**. **I can be confident one moment and then crumble the next. I get rejected in some form and it just feeds into a spiral.** **This is very long and I am rambling, but thought I would find friendly ears here.

It feels like most communities I have tried to be a part of have features around them that made me distance myself from being a part of that community. I understand that I am the problem in this situation and I'm probably overgeneralizing everything. Here are some examples: I enjoy casual gaming, but not enough to care about gaming news or events. I feel like a huge amount of people in the gaming community my age are overly edgy, rage a lot over games or are neckbeardy which scares me off. I also hate playing video games for hours on end, I get burnt out really easily and gamers usually like to have long sessions with each other. I drifted away from my gaming friends because the burnout from playing video games for hours at a time was too much for me. I enjoy hip hop and r andb, but a lot of the culture around this for my age is associated with people who smoke weed, drink, and go clubbing, which intimidates me as I don't like the loss of control associated with drugs and loud 'carefree' environments like clubs. I also feel like there's huge pressure to be on social media within this community. In high school I was friends with people who were into this community a lot and as they got older we drifted apart as they became clubbers and big on alcohol etc. I enjoy football, but I hate the competitiveness that comes with playing it (even socially, you'll get shouted at or made fun of for mistakes) and there is a hyper masculine/ drinking community stereotype associated with casual footballers my age. I also am terrible at football! I have always dabbled in and out of this community but as I was never very good, I didn't really get any respect, and I found playing a very high pressure scenario. All the above seem like immaturity problems, but there are other communities Ive tried to get into that I didn't have this problem with but I just didn't enjoy being a part of them. For example I have tried an art community, but I am not very good at art which made me embarassed whenever I went to the classes, and the way I think I naturally struggled to make and critique art. I also just felt very uncomfortable in this environment, which I think may be due to the fact that I'm not very passionate about art. I'm happy I at least tried though. I have tried a board game community, but I found it too nerdy for me, and I just didn't find any of the board games we played fun. I just didn't feel engaged enough and as passionate as the others were about the games, and the people in the group were all a lot older than me. I'm constantly looking for communities I can join which I will feel comfortable with. I am thinking maybe a running community. However I am worried that this problem is going to follow me everywhere since I seem to perfectionistic about who I be friends with. Like I already know I don't care about run times and stuff so I may feel out of place being surrounded by people who do care. If anyone else has dealt with this, it would be great to hear some advice.

My mind is empty... people talk for hours i cant even talk for a few secs. Idk how to start convos maybe its just online chat that sucks the blood out of me. I cant even do a small talk. Idk how to ask questions about peoples interests... they tell what they are interested in it and i just say \"cool\" or thats interesting.. my convos are so dumb and dull and boring.. i cant attract beautiful intelligent women either. Im the worst human being in this earth by definition. Movies or tv shows make me sad cause ppl in there are.super cool super smart and rich and im a loser.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'[LONG/VENT] My first 2 therapy sessions made me feel worse. What should I do?. 25 year old male, living with my mom alone. I\\'ve never worked in my life. Never been in a relationship. Haven\\'t had a friend IRL in 10 years, which is also the amount of time that I\\'ve avoided going outside entirely unless absolutely necessary (a handful of times.). Never really been diagnosed with anything, but I have really bad social anxiety for sure. Deep depression and personality issues, adhd, possibly autistic spectrum. Who knows. I\\'ve avoided going to therapy/doctors for my entire life due to my anxiety and negative thoughts. I would talk with people online and I would always say that I would never go to a therapist, and thought it would never help me. This was based on brief interactions that I\\'ve had with therapists online, and me looking up stuff about therapists on the internet. Recently, other physical health issues of mine got so bad that I had to go to the ER, which lead me to going to a general doctor, which lead me to finally try to find a therapist. Problem is, I\\'m poor. I only have free insurance from the government, and there\\'s only a handful of therapists in my area that take it. I looked at their profiles. A lot of them honestly made me upset and uncomfortable, so I tried calling the ones that I thought I might get along with. Every. Single. One. said they weren\\'t accepting new clients. Which lead me to my only other option, going to a \"health center\" or something like that, dunno what it\\'s called, but it\\'s the place where courts send people who have drug addictions and stuff. I didn\\'t really have an option and they basically just automatically assigned me a therapist. I felt very uncomfortable with the idea of it. I don\\'t get along with people very well in general. I have a very low tolerance, but I\\'m so horrified of expressing my negative and rude thoughts out of fear for rejection. I really wanted to be able to choose someone that I thought would fit me well, but I still forced myself to give it a try anyways. I had this picture in my mind of how it would play out. I would come in, sit down. He would ask me questions and try to figure me out, understand my issues. I would try to open up, but mostly fail because I\\'m so anxious and I\\'m really bad at expressing myself. He would give hid input, professional advice, or \"help\", that would just upset and trigger me because I feel like it\\'s just generalized advice for \"normal\" people that\\'s not addressing the root cause of my issues. I would reject the help, repeatedly, until the therapist got sick of my rejection that they got rid of me and sent me to someone else. The fear of being rejected like that is so great that... It just makes it so hard to express my real thoughts and what I think. Anyways, what actually happened when I went to therapy... I guess it was what I expected and also not what I expected... what I expected was to be asked more questions, like he would make attempts at trying to figure me out or understand me, and that didn\\'t happen very much. I tried talking about some of my issues anyways, and he said a lot of things that really upset me deeply, but I didn\\'t feel comfortable expressing out of fear of upsetting him/him rejecting me. There was a lot of \"Learn to love yourself\"/accept yourself/accept negative beliefs/be mindful/cbt kind of comments and ideas that he said. I don\\'t know. I don\\'t really feel it addressed my issues very well. I really didn\\'t want to go the second time, despite the first one making me feel worse. I hoped that after going to the first session, that I would have just a tiny bit of relief, and a tiny bit of hope that MAYBE I could improve and work towards getting better, but it left me feeling more hopeless. I didn\\'t want to go the second time, but it was more of the same basically. It\\'s really hard for me to recall most of the things he said as I have a really bad memory, but most of it upset me and I suppressed my triggered feelings of anger and upset, again out of fear of being rejected and referred away. He talked about quicksand in analogy to struggles, and about how the more you fight against it, the more you sink, and you just need to calm down and just accept the issues and just let them be there. My mind screamed at me, NO!!!!!! I need help with my issues. I can\\'t just accept this. I can\\'t accept how of a miserable spot I\\'m in right now. I\\'m so fucking hopeless. I want to improve, not just sit around accepting and sitting in my misery. He talked about how he believes that everyone is fundamentally \"good enough\" and \"Okay\", which at my core I deeply disagree with. I definitely don\\'t feel good enough, and have so many areas that I need to improve upon, and need help with improving on. I feel like he did more talking than I did as well, and that he didn\\'t really want to seem to ask much questions or try to figure me out... is that normal? I want my issues to be addressed and I don\\'t feel like they are being addressed. And I don\\'t know if it\\'s just my anxiety, but the interactions with him were so awkward and unbearable, but that\\'s just how I am in social situations in general, all social interactions feel awkward and unbearable to me so I don\\'t know if that was him or me. I scheduled a third appointment coming up this Friday, in hope that maybe it will somehow turn around and change, and start slowly helping me instead of making me feel worse and more hopeless when I go. I don\\'t really feel have any options. I\\'m so absolutely stuck in life right now. I\\'m so hopeless and I don\\'t know what to do. I feel like I need help, but so far I don\\'t feel like this is helping, and I don\\'t fee like it could help, and I don\\'t know what could possibly help me. All I know is that this isn\\'t so far and I don\\'t know what to do. I don\\'t know how therapy is supposed to go in the first place, or what to look out for, or what to expect from it, but I should feel like I\\'m getting SOME kind of benefit out of it, right? Is it normal to feel this negative towards it at first? I know how unstable and negative I can be... maybe it\\'s just me getting in my own head, but maybe therapy isn\\'t right for me and maybe I should jump ship? I just don\\'t know what to do.

I always just default to saying \"good how are you\", and she ended up saying \"i\\'m doing really good\" and honestly just seemed super excited but the conversation kind of just ended since I didn\\'t know what else to say and she was like awkwardly walking backwards back to her desk while tripping and regaining balance on her foot lol.

Whenever I’ve had boyfriends in the past she has always hovered over us 24/7. At 18 I decided to go to the movies with my best friend (he happens to be a guy but our relationship is strictly platonic). In the middle of the movie she turns on the find my iphone alert. Everyone in the theater turns to me because the alert sound is so loud. I have to run outside because I’m so embarrassed. I answer the phone and she’s yelling at me because apparently the map showed that I wasn’t where I told her I was (so she was spying on my location..). We argued and she made up some dumb excuse for why she embarrassed me.. saying the weather was bad and that she was concerned, but that it was my fault because I left when I knew the weather would be bad. I’m 19 now. She has access to all my emails (except one that I use for reddit) and social media. I now have social anxiety to the point where my mom has to do everything for me. Anytime our opinions don’t match or I give her “tough love” she tells me she feels betrayed by me. When I order food at restaurants I either let her order for me or I look to her for approval to go ahead and order. It is not even on purpose, it is just habit. When I’m at the doctors office I will explain my issues the best that I can, but she always has to add something because my explanation wasn’t good enough. When I get bad grades, I have a panic attack. I ask myself “what will mom do when she finds out?” I’ve never had a job because I’m too scared to work. My mom is obsessed with my weight. I am 130 pounds and 5 foot exactly. I’m a little on the thicker side but I’m not fat. There have been times when shes grabbed the fat on my arms, my least favorite body part, and said I don’t want my arms to look like “chicken legs” or something like that. I actually don’t normally hate my body, but every time she points something out I start noticing and hating it. Recently I went on antidepressants for my social anxiety. It’s only been about a week on them so I don’t expect much difference and there hasnt been yet. I know SSRI’s can take a while to work. I have eaten pretty normally, but my mom is obsessed with weight gain. I know they can make you gain weight, but its like thats all she talks about. These meds make you really tired so i havent been motivated, but she is forcing me to walk in the heat with her. Ive been telling her how tired they make me, but its like she doesnt understand. So I walked with her and afterwards felt so nauseous that i thought i was going to throw up (and i already have once). I don’t have anymore friends. I haven’t drove my car once this entire summer, and I hardly leave the house. Somedays I feel like a miserable excuse for a person, and this has made me think suicidal thoughts. The other day my mom actually told me that I don’t have depression because its not as bad as someone else she knows. No, maybe I don’t have “depression” but that doesn’t mean I don’t contemplate death. Before I started this medication I thought about death every single day and never told anyone. I love my mom, but this is the result of helicopter parenting. Now, I can’t even order food for myself or call the doctors office to set up an appointment. I would never want my child to go through what I now go through on a day to day basis. I feel like I’ve regressed back to infancy, always looking to my mom for approval. Raising my hand in class is an improvement for me. And that is just sad. At the same time my mom is nagging me to join clubs and make friends and I’m still trying to figure out how to raise my damn hand in class without having a panic attack. But no improvement is ever good enough. If I told her I raised my hand in class for the first time in 6 months she’d tell me that I need to force myself to join a club instead. Then I’m called too sensitive because I regress back into my shell after her statement. And apparently, we don’t believe in congratulating someone for little things like raising their hand because thats nothing. I am going to have to see my school counselor once the semester starts. I cannot keep living like this. This isn’t a reality to me. There is no way this is what my life has become. I have so much to say, and so many dreams of my own. I want to be successful. I don’t want to be figuring out how to be normal functioning human when I’m only months away from being 20.. I’m sorry if this whole thing sounds very melodramatic. I guess it is going to be dramatic for me... i’ve been dealing with it for at least 7 years now. 7 years of social anxiety that has gotten worse and worse over time. I might end up deleting this, idk. I just needed to write this somewhere. I feel so incredibly frustrated and yet completely numb at the same time.

I’m scared my dates will judge me for having relatively little sexual experience. (I’ve only had sex a few times) I’m also scared they will judge me for my living situation (more on that below). * I live with my parents still, since my line of work is hard to break into (Writing). I did secure an internship from home recently, which has the potential to move into full time work. I’m terrified that a potential partner will judge me for this. * I’ve come to the realization this last year that I’m fairly happy with only a close friend or two, yet I believe even an introvert should get out of the house semi-regularly. Can I balance both the loner and involved lifestyles? * I’m trying to lose a lot of weight and so far have succeeded. I cut out all junk food, soda, alcohol and fried foods and don’t eat meat three days a week. I exercise by jogging 5 miles a day. * I’ve re-entered therapy, since it’s extremely beneficial to my well-being. Am I too old to gain a decent social life, partner and job?

It was obvious she was very interested in me, and I got interested in her too. I added her on Facebook after that school trip and she messaged me the next day, saying that she had seen me leaving school but I was already too far away. We chatted for a slight bit and then she said her class had ended she was leaving school. I just said \"ok, talk to you later\" or something along the lines. In reality she wanted me to tell her to meet up, considering that I was free, at home and so was she, free, leaving school. That was the end of our conversation, period. Over the next few weeks/months I kept seeing her at school seeing as we had similar schedules. We\\'d say hi and she\\'d always chat me up. At first we\\'d talk for 5-10 or more minutes. That faded to just saying hi, to not even acknowledging (or rather avoiding) her most times, even though the only thing I thought about while at school was seeing her. That went on for an entire year. The next school year started and for some reason I told my about all this and he, obviously, said how much of a dumbass I for not making a move. So I decided I had to confront her, which just so coincided with her birthday. I messaged her at night on Facebook, saying happy birthday. She responded early in the morning, said thank you and that she was heading up to the university. I, as well, had a class so I said I\\'d see her there. I saw her there and we talked for what seemed like an hour. At the end of it, I just confronted her about what had happened, asked her if she was expecting me to make a move (which I obviously knew the answer to, and it was yes), she said yes. Asked her if she\\'d be down to try to get things going now and she agreed. She had another class and I didn\\'t so I left for home and messaged her as soon as I got there. We talked for the entire day, until she went to her birthday party where she wouldn\\'t have access to a phone or internet. We kept talking non-stop every day, and not in a friend kind of way. It was obvious we were getting together. We met up. Texted. Talked. Met up again. Dated for like 3 weeks or a month and while I was very nervous at times, it was the best weeks of my life. I still remember her touch. Her kissing my cheek, my neck. After that she suddenly texts me saying she feels the relationship is heading towards a friendship rather than a girlfriend/boyfriend type of a situation, and that was due to me not showing enough affection, love. An *entire year* of being obsessed with her, finally mustering up the courage to confront her, us getting together only for it to fall apart so quickly absolutely *devastated* me. I was dead. Dead. We agreed on being friends, and we kept in touch. Talked on Facebook and met up from time to time. While I obviously still had feelings for her, and she was aware of it, it wasn\\'t too bad. Yes I was sulking at times, but I was getting by. There were times where I didn\\'t really even think of her that much. - And then this Friday...We decided to meet up because she messaged me saying she missed me a ton (I had seen her over coffee two weeks prior). We met up near our school, walked around for about an hour, then went to a bar where a friend of mine works and drank, but not a lot. Just got tipsy. We probably spent 3-4 hours there, talking non-stop. Then I took her home (which is pretty far away from mine). We sat outside her house at 1am talking and talking. It felt exactly like the times when we were together. And that, I think, was the final nail the coffin. Experiencing a situation so similar to the ones when we were dating brought it *all* back. I\\'ve had my moments of depression, usually a day or two, but it\\'s never been this bad. I am extremely depressed and see no reason to live at all (not even considering suicide or harming myself). I can\\'t get back with her, but I can\\'t get her out of my head either. *All* I think about is her. The very first thought, every single day I wake up is her name. I don\\'t see cutting her off as an option either because of two reasons. One, I *do* want to just be friends with her if being a couple is not an option because I get along with her more than anyone else I\\'ve met in my life. And more importantly, two, not being in contact with her doesn\\'t seem to make me lose affection for her. I had almost zero contact with for an entire year and I was still madly in love.

I went to the gaeltacht (irish speaking summer camp, 3 weeks only speaking irish away from home), when I was 13-15, and it was an amazing experience. I made new friends from all over the country, fell in love with the language, laughed so much every day. We stayed in houses and in each house was 1-2 leaders which were super bubbly talkative people who had to bring us out of our shell, break the ice in the early days, make sure we didn\\'t speak english, and they also ran daily activities. I knew I was shy but I wanted to be a leader and I thought if I didn\\'t know anyone then I\\'d be able to be that talkative and bubbly. When I was 16, I went as a leader. Everyone was SO SO extroverted, and because we were being \"evaluated\" by our superiors, being watched to see how well we mixed and interacted with other people, I got stage fright and didn\\'t talk to anyone. It was horrible, I felt so ashamed of myself for thinking I could do this and for being the only one who was shy. They must have been thinking \"what the hell is she doing here\". Long story short, none of the other leaders liked me. Like, they hated me. They\\'d talk to me and I\\'d be super quiet and they\\'d do the \"okaaaaay\" and their eyes would dart around and smile at someone when they talked to me. They also gave me grief one day because this boy asked me out, they were making fun of me, which hurt because the girl who was laughing at me was once my leader when I was a student, and I used to be the type of kid who would idolise and have faith in people. This experience broke that. We have one day where parents visit and most people go to a neighbouring town for lunch with them, I saw the other leaders and said \"Hi!!\" and they blanked me. To give context, this wasn\\'t a \"job\", leaders tend to form a close knit group, and I was outside of this. We had a day out to the cinema and there was no room on the bus so I had to go in a teachers car. The teacher shouted into the bus \"who wants to come with me and aoiphes in the car?\", no one moved. Anyway, I don\\'t know why exactly but my faith in others and more importantly myself broke, and is still broken. I actually blocked the experience out, I used to think about it at night and literally sweat and cry and push it out of my mind - it was humiliation, 3 straight weeks of it. I\\'m leaving specific bits out because they\\'re hard to describe but a lot of my flashbacks were of peoples expressions of suppressed laughter anytime I spoke to them. Or another leader rolling her eyes at me for not being good enough. It was like, you know when you do something silly by accident in front of people, and you think about it for years but the amount you think of it decreases with time? Well it\\'s like that, only happening continuously for 3 weeks. I honestly think I got PTSD from that experience. It took me years to allow myself to think about it, and it was painful. My description probably doesn\\'t make it sound that bad, but it was just things happening over and over again that confirmed for me that I was a failure and everyone hates me. Learning negative things about yourself one after the other with no time to process. It\\'s been better lately. Sometimes I think about it without cringing. Again, this probably sounds like a relatively normal experience but it was just overwhelmingly negative and honestly ruined my life.\\')', 'labels': ['not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'related to an outdoor space with negative effect', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect'], 'scores': [0.6916511654853821, 0.10980993509292603, 0.10647380352020264, 0.09206511825323105]}\n",

I've tried therapy once before, my therapist was so nice but she made me really anxious, she was super confident and smiley and I felt like I had to emulate that even when I didn't feel the part. I noticed myself omitting certain pieces of information in fear of being criticized. I eventually stopped going. For a while I went back and forth on giving it another shot with a different therapist because I'm almost certain I will benefit greatly if I find a good one.

Hey guys, I've been anxious and depressed enough that I can't take it anymore, when I was the age of 0-14 I was a funny, very social, empathious fun kid. I always had friends, always was a part of everything and everyone recognized me for my laughing. Untill I hit my puberty ( not the reason why I'm anxious I think ) since that time I got even scared to open the door, I still don't have a job ( I'm 16 now ) and I'm currently in wait for my new school which I'm 2 months later then everyone else. Just because I canceled my other school since I was too anxious of finding a internship work place. I still only have old friends from the time when I was 'myself' and no new ones. I've always been very hyper since I was a kid and then my parents decided to diagnose me and turned out I had ADHD. It dind't bother me at that time. I do speak to my parents but not very much. Especially not about my feelings which I don't do with barely anyone. I dissapoint them alot with my anxious feelings for example the one from when I needed to find the internship work place. My mom keeps saying that I'm anxious because I have been judged by everyone my whole life and I know she is right but its not only that, I have also been taking Ritalin for a few years and from that moment everything changed, one day when I felt very anxious after 30 minutes of taking my Ritalin. I was in school at lunch break just with a bunch of friends because I wasn't having those anxious issues then, but I felt very depressed and anxious then and I also later called my mom asked if I could go home because I was feeling sick. I dind't mention that I was anxious to her. Next day I woke up and again took my dose of Ritalin ( I'm not gonna call it medication ) I felt exactly the same as the day before so I called my mom again and asked if I could go home. I still dind't tell about the anxious and negative thought I had. From that moment I wasn't feeling myself untill this day. I am feeling so tired, nothing makes me happy and I just feel so fucking miserable and anxious about even doing the smallest things. The worst thing is that I KNOW I can be myself because I have been in the past, but I don't know how or what to do. I'm also using little doses of sativa or hybrid strains of weed ( I vaporize them ) and it does really help for my ADHD to calm down my brains but it still doesn't make me feel myself happy from how I used to be. Obviously I still have some days where I feel happy but those only happen like once in a month . I also once was out for dinner with the whole fam and I was feeling very drowsy and just not active but I brought my filled vaporizer ( dry herb vaporizer ) with weed. So I vaped outside and I was myself again, I was talking to my fam and it was like I was reborn again. When I got home I was so happy and mostly proud, I later said to my mom what I did when I went outside and she already knew I smoke and shes okay with it as long as I don't get addicted and she also was a bit happy because she really saw the diffrence, its not always when weed works like that. But when I'm with friends and I smoke I always feel very comfortable around them and have a good time. They mostly make me forget to look at my phone so thats a good sign. I really want to feel like how I used to because most people liked me then alot. I also stopped growing from when I was using the Ritalin and last year I have grown so much from the moment when I stopped using it. I feel like ritalin fucked up my serotonin receptors because I know alot about all drugs. I know that Ritalin is in the same family as speed which makes it possible that it fucked up my serotonin receptors. Anyhow I've also tried LSD a couple of times and it made me social anxious as fuck, really dind't wanna see anyone when I did that. But I know that that isn't how I am because I used to be so social but how come I'm not anymore? If anyone has tips or questions. Please feel free to ask / tell them!! I use L-theanine now for a while and it makes me alot more relaxed in my head, but they don't bring back the old me. I don't use chemical pills ever again because they're dangerous and addictive. Not only because they're toxic itself but also because they might have fucked up my whole personality. Its insane that when I think of it now they just give speed to 8 year olds because they have a disorder which makes them hyper in their head. Its not right, thats the reason why I only use natural products to relax my brain, L-Theanine, weed and omega-3. I also have used XTC like 3 times and when I do xtc I can talk to people again with no problem and it just goes extremely easy then. But I don't use it more then twice a year. Please if anyone has any tips or comments pleasee ask or tell them! Also if someone knows how to like boosts my serotonin/dopamine receptors I'd love to hear how.

Now it\\'s even worse though because it happens at work, and I work on movie sets, and on movie sets they usually record sound because it\\'s post-1920, which means everyone on set needs to be DEAD silent. Sometimes there are emotional scenes with long, silent pauses in between actors\\' lines. Sometimes there\\'s just quiet while they\\'re waiting for an airplane to go by. And at the end of every day or when they finish shooting in a particular space, they record \"room tone\" which is just 30 seconds of complete, 100% silence. And usually these spaces are very small and filled with lots of people like the director, the script supervisor, the 1st AD, the DP, the 1st AC, the 2nd AC, the boom operator and/or sound mixer, 1+ talent, possibly other department heads like the gaffer, key grip, production designer, or makeup, possibly multiple PAs there to make sure everybody is quiet, etc. and if you make noise you\\'ve fucked up the take. I have such severe anxiety about stomach noises on set that I basically try to avoid actually being on set as much as possible. I\\'m constantly terrified of getting stuck inside when they\\'re about to shoot, because as an electrician I might need to be nearby for small, last second lighting adjustments, or even worse, to do a light gag (lights go on/off or flicker/dim during the shot). I avoid it at all costs and try to stay in an area with no people or somewhere outside where it\\'s loud. It\\'s a daily source of anxiety for me because I never know when I might end up in one of these situations. I\\'ve noticed it seems to happen more when I\\'m anxious, which is almost all the time, and additionally, when I\\'m anxious ABOUT it happening--like it causes itself in a vicious feedback loop. I think for me the physical symptoms of anxiety must somehow cause it, because it\\'s become very evident that I get stomach problems the more worried I am, for example I\\'ll be fine in the morning when I first wake up, but as I\\'m driving to work, I start to feel sick and I do for the first few hours of the day until I calm down. Basically, I\\'m pretty sure the answer is just relax, just chill out mentally, and your body will respond by being at ease. Obviously this is way easier said than done for people with SA. Other than that just drink plenty of water, eat a healthy and balanced breakfast (but not too much), get enough sleep, exercise (this is a huge one), and overall just take that extra step to take care of yourself and your wellbeing.

            "{'sequence': \"('Social Anxiety from eating in public. Advice on self-help tips for overcoming this?. Sorry in advance for the long story that i’m about to post but I hope you guys give it a read. I’ve been getting social anxiety especially from eating in public for 2-3 years now and the fact that I can’t even have a peaceful/enjoyable meal out with my friends have been eating me inside out and I want to overcome this so so so badly. The past few years has honestly been the worst few years of my life and I so desperately want things to change. The eating anxiety I have doesn’t really come from being afraid of being looked at in public, its more of being afraid that I would gag/throw up when eating because of the intense nauseous feelings I get whenever I am eating outside in public and it simply just kills my appetite. Its like a vicious cycle. This is how it all started. 3 years ago, I was still all fine with very minimal social anxiety. Since young I have always been a shy and quiet person if you don’t get to know me well but among my friends i’d like to think that I am quite talkative and fun. I hung out with friends very easily in school and used to enjoy going out with them. I even had many friends from the “popular” group in school if that’s what you call them. However sadly this changed for the worse in 2017. I was finishing school and was about to enter mandatory military service. I suddenly got so much anxiety ever since I was about to enter military as there was so much uncertainties that I had about it. I was afraid that I would have a tough time, afraid that I would not be able to adapt to a very different environment, afraid of missing home too much etc. To put it shortly, there were so many things that were not under my control that gave me so much anxiety during this period. I was still at school when all these anxiety came about, and it seemed to just keep getting worse during that time. Sometimes in the morning before going to school i’d feel nauseous for no reason, even brushing my teeth in the morning would cause me to gag. Sometimes (even though rarely) I would even have to go to the toilet just because I felt like throwing up from the nausea I was getting. I started losing appetite very easily and started to rarely have a proper meal during lunch time in school. I started avoiding going out with my friends because of all this feelings I was getting stemming from the anxiety I got. Fast forward to now, I have completed my service and about to start uni early next year. I would say that my anxiety has gotten much better compared to where I was a few years back. However I was never the same in terms of eating in public ever since. I still get all nauseous/choked up/no appetite whenever I am eating outside. When I eat at home its the complete opposite, I can properly enjoy a good meal with no issues at all when i’m home, because I feel “safe”, that even if I throw up/gag nobody can notice or judge. And because of this sense of safety, ironically I don’t have any anxiety at all and don’t feel any nausea, However when i’m out I can only eat in small bites and I find it so difficult to even finish a normal meal. Its taken such a massive toll on my social life. In the past I would hang out with my friends every week, and also go outside to play sports every week. Now these things rarely ever happen anymore, not because I wasn’t invited but because I had to reject my friends every time they asked me out because I didn’t want to end up embarassing myself when we have a meal. Honestly this really hurt me so much because my friends probably now thinks I am deliberately avoiding them or that I don’t wanna hang out with them anymore but the truth is I really don’t have a choice because of all the anxiety I have had experienced. Sometimes I just wished that everyone can understand how I feel or what I am going through. I am starting school again in a few months and I really want to just change myself, and go back to my old self where I had no anxiety when eating in public, where I could really feel joy and happiness when going out with my family and friends, where I don’t have to keep worrying about my eating anxiety, and where I can just feel genuinely happy again.

I experienced most/all of the things you mention. I wouldn’t go anywhere for weeks for fear of people seeing me. I was terrified if I went outside to get the mail that a neighbor would see me and judge me. I’d only go grocery shopping at bizarre hours and only use the self check out because of fear of what the cashier would think of me and my purchases. Going to any social event caused panic attacks (sweating, trembling, trouble breathing, chest pain, dizziness). I lived a solitary life and would go months without social interaction. Going so long without having so much as a conversation made me really awkward in any social interaction that I did have. I would be really quiet and keep to myself. Afterwards I’d over-analyze everything that happened, even for days or weeks. So how did I climb out…? Very slowly. I have been on and off antidepressants (SSRIs) since I was 15, never on for longer than 3 months, then I would hop back on when I started to feel really down. I think they helped with the depression, but not so much the social anxiety. I have been on and off therapy as well…and couldn’t really commit to that either. It’s hard to go tell someone your most intimate feelings and thoughts when you’re afraid of how they’re judging you. However, I think it does help some people. I was recommended this [book](It might help. I made one friend towards the end of high school. I had no idea why he wanted to be my friend, but I was so desperate for a friend I just went with it. I found it much easier to just hang with 1 person than a large group that I didn’t know. Then I made one really good friend in my first year of college. She much more actively took action to become my friend, than me becoming hers. We became basically inseparable, and she was my only friend for a while but that was okay because all my social needs were met through her. I transferred schools and she got a boyfriend and our very codependent relationship kinda fell apart. I felt lost for a while, but that is when I realized that I shouldn’t be that dependent on someone else. I made a friend at my new school. I moved on campus and started interacting more with my roommates. I became involved with clubs. I started by just attending talks and meetings, then eventually went onto becoming an officer. A lot of classes were team projects, so I befriended some teammates. I took a teaching assistant position and met people that way. As my circle of friends grew, I met more friends through them. I threw some parties. I went to parties. I learned that sometimes you have to be assertive when making friends. I faked confidence and asked people to hang out, chatted them up online, said hi and talked to them when I saw them. Eventually, it starts to feel less forced and more natural. By the time I graduated I had a great group of friends ranging from very close to not so close. It wasn’t smooth sailing always. I had a really hard time during my internship. I didn’t fit in with the other interns at all. It was like they just looked at me and labeled me as a loser. I felt very socially awkward since most of my friends were also very nerdy/geeky and the interns were a different breed. I did try, but I failed and it was a hard summer for me. I spent most my weekends alone while the others were out doing what interns should do when spending the summer in a beautiful new city. About 6 months ago I moved to a new city, and it’s been tough making friends and adjusting. I feel the insecurities and low self-esteem creeping in on me. I hated constantly meeting new people and small talk. I’m so paranoid that people will see through my confident veneer and find me to be just a giant loser. I miss the easiness with my friends. I tried organizing events with some people at work, but those fell through. Sucks being in a new city with so much to do, but no one to do with it. In the back of my mind, I still fear that if I go do things alone people will see me think of me as a friendless loser. As you can see it’s still a struggle sometimes, but I know I’ve come a long way. I don’t think I’ll ever be the life of the party or 100% not socially awkward. I still have fears and insecurities, but I think the best way to get over them is to just face them. Sometimes you’ll fail real hard, but you’ll learn and get better. I know it’ll be a while before I build a social network like the one I had in college. I’m gonna try taking a fun class after work, meetup.com, and finding a place to volunteer. I’m planning on facing my fear of doing things alone…and I’m gonna go out there and do things alone and hopefully make friends along the way.

Nobody respected me and they obviously talked behind my back because they thought I was annoying or weird or unlikeable and like you\\'ve experienced, they also made these strange proclamations of my name in class too and I think the straw that broke the camels back was when I started to realize that when we had to do the \"find someone to be in group with\" stuff people would walk away as soon as I walked over to them even if I had occasionally talked with them before. It\\'s a testament to how bad my social skills were and how asocial i was outside of classes but what could I do? I couldn\\'t figure it out and people started to think me annoying for it which led to internal bullying. In middle school I had more of it. People would always put me down for whatever I did that wasn\\'t academically succesful which was at least nice so I had something I was okay at, at the time. If I started running people would point and laugh because \"you\\'re a nerd and you can\\'t be sporty\". If I said something I thought was funny then people would default to arrogance and assume what I was about to say would be stupid and then look at each other laughing at what I said as if they were embarrassed I was trying to make eye contact with them because I wasn\\'t worth talking to. I would go as far as to say I have a kind of built up hatred towards people in general over my early schooldays. I know my problems stem from my own lack of putting myself into respect, but sometimes one thing leads to another for no particualr reason and you\\'re put in an unfortunate position for the rest of your time in a group and that can scar you for life if you can\\'t move on from it easily. I don\\'t think often about it admittedly, but if I have to think back in my life all my problems started early on like that. I don\\'t trust people and I assume what I do will be unworthy or stupid or cringeworthy before I even try and i don\\'t take risks because I\\'m afraid people will laugh or ridicule me. It\\'s not irrational. That whole \"anxiety is irrational\" crap is bullshit if you have tried being bullied. It\\'s real and there is a consequence that genuinely hurts if you fail and you\\'ve tried it before, and my worst thoughts tell me that I hate a lot of people for not understanding because they\\'re had it incredibly easy. They\\'ve never fallen out in a group and they\\'ve never done something bad which they couldn\\'t then defend or make up for afterwards. They\\'ve not been stuck in a hole without the skills to crawl up again.

I\\'m going to be a 100 diets will not work for you and when I mean \"Diet\" I mean just going on a diet for couple weeks and then stopping and going back to what you usually eat. You have to make a lifestyle change. That means quitting foods that are making you gain weight and replacing foods that make you not gain weight. I\\'ll tell you straight up what worked for me. Ok here\\'s what I do I would waking up early and then run a mile everyday with empty stomach w/ only water. Then for lunch everyday I ate a salad (Which I hate) and water. Lastly when I got home I ran another mile and for dinner I ate either Starches, Fruits, and Veggies. Sleep is also essential because that\\'s where you lose weight/gain muscle. That would be my \"Diet\" plan to lose weight fast but if you ever want long term results your going to have change your lifestyle/eating habits and either eliminate, reduce, or replace them. I can also give a list of amazing foods and a book that I would 100% recommend for people trying to lose weight. That sounds amazing that you got on a date! It\\'s fine do whatever seems right I would get her talking about her life get to know her more. You have to master the skills of Listening to keep the Convo going with follow up questions or relating stories and then ending the convo with like another date or something. Don\\'t get to nervous we are here to help. Sorry bout the long ass rant just trying to help.

This was a three day fest and on day two i went out drinking in this garden. I was drinking with my buddies (all guys) and after some time a group of girls from our University came and started drinking besides us. While drinking i noticed that two girls from that group are checking me out. Something about myself:- I am a 21 year old law student in the last year of his course. I have major social anxiety and in my five years at Uni, i have only socialized with a small group of people in my four years in Uni and almost all of them were guys. This was primarily because i got a cultural shock when i moved from a small town to one of the elitist University in India. I am 6ft 2inch with good facial features but a skinny frame. Generally people rate me 7/10. I was decently confident when i started University, but due to my inability to speak fluent English (which is the primary language of conversation in this place) and the highly urban crowd which i had never experienced before, my self confidence was very badly damaged. On top of that i made friends with people who had the same problem of language and culture like me, people who didn\\'t exactly \\'fit\\' in this place. Irrespective, they were pretty toxic and always discouraged and scrutinized any attempts that I made to socialize with people out of our social circle. They would make fun of me for misspranousning words in my presentation and not able to form a coherent sentence when participating in class or speaking to other students. This led to me becoming more and more anxious leading to a total stop by me to try anything or interacting with new people. I just started keeping quiet in lectures and just didn\\'t interact with anyone in the class and made my body language very unnapprochable. This led me getting isolated, loosing my self worth and growing more and more insecure about myself everyday. I started suppressing my opinions and started doing everything which was acceptable by my isolated group of friends. I turned to weed and used to numb myself with it to coupe with the anxiety but the paranoia kept making it worse. I finally started fighting back from my third year and started working on myself. I started getting better at speaking English, learned a lot of new things, got better at studies and putting my opinion forward. I started being more assertive about my boundaries and stopped my friends from walking all over me all the time. But still there is a lot of anxiety, insecurity and an overall inferiority complex. I have only dated one girl in my life which was long distance, we met twice in 3 months and just made out. I don\\'t consider this a proper relationship though. I have a decent amount of good female friends. But it is very difficult for me to talk to a unknown girl, and usually make a fool of myself. I get a decent amount of female attention and a lot of girls have tried to flirt with me but i just get too anxious and awkward. I start overthinking the interaction and always find a way to convince myself that this one isn\\'t right for maybe the next one. However, now i have changed myself and i am trying to actively communicate with girls. I even approached two girls in the gap of six months and got rejected both the times due to very awkward conversation both the times. I have been feeling very lonely for the past 3 years and i crave romantic intimacy. Coming back to story:- After realising that both of them have been glancing towards me, i started making eye contact with the one I was interested in. However, like always i didn\\'t approach her and just left the place after finishing the booze and even give a look back. The next day( last day of the fest) i popped ecstasy and went to the garden with my friends, i started tripping intensely after i reached the party garden. Coincidentally, the same group of girls from day two came and started drinking 20 meters away from us. At this time i had reached my \\'peak\\' of ecstasy and was tripping major nutsack. The high started reducing and got a collected my self a little bit but i was still pretty high, now i start noticing that the same girl from yesterday was again galncing at me in very short intervals, i started making eye contact with her but would break it in 2-3 seconds because of second thoughts. My friends started leaving for college but i was still pretty high so i decided to stay on my own, i started socialzing with people that i knew and all this while me and that girl kept making eye contact. I still wasn\\'t sure weather i should go and talk to her. Then she looked at me for like 10 seconds without breaking eye contact and gave a huge smile. Because of the lowself esteem idiot that i am, i looked turned my neck in both the directions to confirm that she was actually smiling at me. Any other day I would have bounced from that place without approaching her because of my fear of rejection and making a fool out myself but not this time. This time i was on Ecstasy and wasn\\'t feeling my high level of anxiety which generally happens in these kind of situation. I decided I am going to make to make a move this time. I had promised myself in the summer that I\\'ll try and break my virginity in my last year of law school. I waited for an appropriate moment in which she wasn\\'t occupied too much by her friends. I saw an opening and started walking towards her, she was making her drink from the bottle which was on the ground. I stopped 3 ft away from she turned saw me and smiled like she was expecting me. She turned her head again and i just froze. I couldn\\'t utter a word, and after standing there for like 5 seconds without saying anything. I just walked of from their. I cursed by my self for being so pathetic and thought about going back in the college. But i decided to calm myself and try once again because i was really interested in this girl. I smoke a cigarette, muster all the courage and started walking towards her again, this time she was standing with her friend who were both dancing on rap. I stopped she saw me then started looking at her friend. I am feeling extremely nervous right now but i fight it and after 3 seconds i say \" I am sorry for earlier, i just got nervous\" in a very shaky voice. She responded \"it\\'s okay you don\\'t have to worry about that\" in a very soft tone. I ask her name tell her mine then shook her hand. Another friend of her came thinking that i was making her friend uncomfortable. Her friend who came, starts looking at me in a very suspicious way because it could be interpreted by my face that i was on some hard Drugs ( which i think the girl who i approached also figured out) my anxiety shoot up the roof and i wasn\\'t able to utter even an alphabet. I froze again and walked of again, this time for real. I had a very bad trip after this incident and kept cursing myself for being a losser. I seriously need help as to how to overcome my social anxiety and be self- confident, that why i gave a detailed description of myself. I also got to know that the girl i approached is a mutual friend of a guy freind of mine and he has recommended me to send a insta request and start chatting with her. I want your opinion weather i should send her a request or i should just forget about her\\')', 'labels': ['related to an outdoor space with negative effect', 'not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect'], 'scores': [0.29032763838768005, 0.25456109642982483, 0.24162860214710236, 0.21348269283771515]}\n",

The funny thing is that I\\'ve already thought I had it around five years ago but I was hesitant (and still am) because \"personality disorder\" sounds like a whole other league than \"only\" anxiety. But the description of it fits me perfectly and much more than SA. I fit all the criteria from both ICD-10 and DSM-5 for AvPD. Just a few days ago I wondered why something like extreme self-consciousness wasn\\'t classified as a disorder. What I think is one of the biggest differences is that I usually don\\'t feel actual fear/panic (with shivering, fast heartbeat, sweating etc.). I\\'ve only had one panic attack so far and it wasn\\'t during a social setting. I\\'m very tense in public, but I wouldn\\'t call it afraid. Like you, I\\'m estranged to my whole family and I even had a close friend who I suddenly couldn\\'t talk to normally anymore, like she was a stranger but she really wasn\\'t.

I get wasted on days I feel like people dislike me (like when coworkers don\\'t sit down next to me at work, or ignore me when I ask a question).

Hi, I've noticed I haven't left the house much in the last couple of days apart from to get food, so spend like an hour out the house and then come back. I'm working on Fiverr atm and making quite a lot of money from it, much more then a 9/5 job would give me. And its freelance so I can set my hours etc. I guess my question is a two part thing. The first thing is that i'm aware that my job working from home in my music studio is quite isolating, but also if im more comfortable working this way and am making way more then a 9/5 anyway do I really need a 9/5? I still go out and socialise and see my mates on the weekend at least, but most of my days im alone working and then go out for nights out if im invited. My days atm basically is mostly making music for people all day and then I try and get out for a run or go to the shops for an hour or so in between. But sometimes if my mates don't have work they will invite me to stuff and ill go. Second part of the question is does anyone else do this? like find themselves staying at home a lot. Like say if there's a day where I don't have work to do id still choose to stay at home and chill instead of go and walk around the city aimlessly. Like if I don't have a plan ill just spend my day at home. I don't even view it as an anxiety thing really, im just not great at doing stuff on my own and if I do like I don't really see the point in just aimlessly walking around the city with nothing to do because.... there's nothing to do ahahah.  and#x200B; What do you guys do when your alone and don't have work that day? do u guys stay at home all day and chill also. is this ok to do? assuming you've got work on other days like I do.

            "{'sequence': \"('How social anxiety ruined my life. Hi there reddit, since i am not a native English speaker i'll be using Google Translaitor. I am not seeking for help or life advice i just want to talk. I am 20 and half years old and only now i realised how completely i ruined my life because of the anxiety. And there is no way out for me. As far as I remember myself, I was always a rather shy and closed child, I did not go out outside unnecessarily. My first friends (and the only ones) appeared in my 5th grade. I well remember how we met, it was some kind of event and a couple of guys from my class came up to me and we just started chatting about everything - games, films, football, we chatted for at least two hours and then headed home and exchanged each other with console games. And in my opinion, it was a lot easier to communicate with strangers then. Secondary school, and then in my opinion the first problems appeared. When the homework was a pubic presentation or recitation of a verse by heart, I never completed these homewroks, as a result of which I got F grade and I had to hope only that in future we would no longer have such tasks, I was also afraid to go to the teacher and give me an individual task. In high school, the situation did not change, I was still afraid of public speaking and did not leave home unnecessarily, and when friends called for a walk, I always said that I was busy. A quick fact, in all my life I have never been to a cafe, to the cinema i wasnt even in a store alone. If I needed something, I asked my parents or sister to buy me. In 2016, I passed the exams and entered the pedagogical university at the Faculty of Philology, this was one of the biggest mistakes in my life. Due to the fact that I did not really care about where to go, I had to quickly choose the direction. I had to move from countryside to city (not to far tho, about 130 kms) and learn to live on my own, buy groceries, pay utility bills and most importantly communicate with people, from that moment I no longer saw my friends live, both moved to other cities. Speaking of classes at the university, each English class needed to stand in front of the audience and tell the learned text, there were also quite often group work, and if I could barely cope with the first example, then when we worked in groups I was ready to disappear, run away , do anything if only I were not here, cause i simply cant talk to people which i dont know, My palms and forehead began to sweat. No kidding, when I reached the bus stop and went to the university, for me it was a real challenge. What makes me even more anxious is that there were 22 girls and 6 boys in the group keying me. I went through anxiety for two months until one day I decided not to go to university, and from that moment on, my life went awry. I began to skip classes more and more, sleep problems started, I went to bed at 8 in the morning, and got up at 7 in the evening and my parents didnt even know about this situation. With bad points, but I still went through the first semester. But in the second situation did not change, I was not at the university for exactly a month and none of my classmates, headmen or curator were interested in what happened to me. By the way, in January 2017, I stopped talking with one of my friends, the communication just broke due to some little trifle I don’t even want to mention it. April 2017, the curator told his parents that I did not attend classes, but I in turn made promises that I would attend classes. One day, after a long absence in class, the curator called me to his place and began to ask me what was happening to me, I had good points for the first months of my studies, and then everything went awry. After the conversation, she advised me to turn to a psychologist, but I immediately rejected this idea, although now, I understand that it might be worth giving this idea a chance. Even the girls from the group offered me their help, but I refused, i decided that it will be extremley hard to comeback.I just don’t have the courage to approach the teacher and ask for additional classes. As a result i was expelled from university. While I was in the city alone, I talked a lot about what to do next. They set me up as an example for my sister, laid more hopes on me, but I just didn’t live up to these hopes, I myself was not in awe of myself, I considered myself miserable and that there was no place for me like this in this world, so I decided that the best option there will be suicide. I decided to hang myself in the closet and when I felt cramps and lack of oxygen, a stupid thought crept into my head and said to me “Do not do this, give yourself a chance”. Now, I really regret that I succumbed to that thought and did not finish what it would be worth In September 2017, I entered college and again, in November 2017, I was expelled. Classical history, anxiety, unwillingness to leave the dorm room due to loneliness, although I understand that I had to go to college and university not for communication, but for education. For almost 2 years now I have been living with my parents in the village, I leave the house only to throw snow from the yard, I haven’t been talking with my last friend since January 2019. My younger sister graduated from college, works and receives money, while I just sit on the neck of the parents. Guess, i messed up my life, opportunities, goal and there is nothing i can do about it. I dont watch movies, series, anime, sometimes playing games but right now nothing interests me, i just lay down on the bed and thinking about my pasy and what i have done. Last year I tried to start all over again at the university but I didn’t have 3 points to enter.

When I was 20 my besfriend broke up with her long term bf and started geting closer to me and then confessed that she loved me and I already had a tiny crush on her so we decided to try it out ( didnt last long ) we went on 3 diffrent dates. First date we just went to the movies and later ate at a restaurant and walked around after that day she ghosted me for 2 weeks and then started talking to me again and said sorry and wanted to try again. Second date I went hiking with her and watched the sunset and ate at a pizza place after that day she avoided me for a few days with a bunch excuses then asked me out again and I was like sure. Third date we went to a restaurant then walked by the beach and saw the sunset she kissed me that night and told me why she avoided me all those days apperntly she was scared we would destroy our friendship and she already lost her bofriend and didnt wanna lose me too well I accepted her but few days later I went out with a cousin to watch some movies and a saw her walking with her neighboor (she told she was studying at home ) and then they started kissing they looked so inloved. It kinda hurt becuase she was my befriend and lied to me. But I grabbed my phone took a picture of them send it to her and told her with a message \"I just saw you And I dont think we can be friends anymore\" and I ghosted her after that I cut all contact with friends of hers and family (first time I ghosted someone). I like to tell myself its no big deal but it really hurts when someone you trust betrays you like that. This event isnt really the reason for my anxiety but it sure made a bit worse I think. I had a rough childhood parents were really aggrasive and both are introverts and when I was diagonesed with anxiety as a kid my parent decided to try not to fight in front of me anymore ( they didnt do a good job at it ) aslo tey started ignoring me becuase they thought they were toxic for me to be around them. So I grow up with introverted parents that argued violently in front of me and isolated me. Afcouse they werent bad parents they did the best that they good. They fucked me up mentally but I didnt starve, I have a home, education I am doing fine so they did great job and I love them for it.\\')', 'labels': ['related to an outdoor space with negative effect', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect', 'not related to an outdoor space'], 'scores': [0.5833914875984192, 0.1544276773929596, 0.14162324368953705, 0.12055753916501999]}\n",

It’s real bad especially if the other team targets you because your the weak one in the team. Some other examples of anxiety in sports that I’ve felt looking back. When your playing football and you run out, you see the quarterback and he looks at you and then ignores you and continues with the play. Or he finally decides to throw it to you and sadly the catch is not received. Especially embarrassing if your wide-open :/ Same with baseball, someone would hit a pop fly out to me and I would usually miss and have to throw it in. The shame, the shameeee. The rest I would just try to make jokes on them I would feel the anxiety but I wasn’t scared of doing the sports. I was scared of failure and of losing. I was real competitive back then.

Back in my home country, I did not have this debilitating sense of dread whenever I needed to go outside. I have lived in Asia and went to an international school since the second grade. I had a lot of confidence in myself, as well as a decent group of friends. I still wasn't the most social guy, but I had friends I could relate to. I was able to go to malls, shopping centres, cafes and what not, and converse with the cashier/waitress as a normal person would, although I was a bit awkward. Since then, I've moved to the UK for my undergrad, and man I've basically become a shut-in here. I am too shy to make friends with the local students, I feel like my english despite being good enough is different from the way its spoken in Britain, hence whenever I try to start a conversation, my sentences tend to be incomplete and simply words strung together without a proper structure. My self-esteem has suffered deeply because of this. It's been a year and a half now, and its not getting any better. I'm feeling a mixture of denial and knowing that I shouldn't feel this way because I could function normally back home, as well as anger at myself because I just can't help myself to get out of this condition. I refuse to acknowledge that I have a problem, and I keep looking for reasons as to why I might be the way I am now. Here's how my daily life feels like to me: I leave my apartment complex and walk to university. On my way, I feel that everybody is looking at me, judging me for being so awkward and lame. Once I get to the lecture rooms, people are conversing outside, talking to each other while waiting for class to start. I see people I've talked to before, but for some fucking reason I decide not to make eye contact and sit/lounge around alone. I take out my phone, hoping that nobody notices that I am a loner. I walk into the class, and am greeted by the sight and sound of hundreds of students in this massive lecture hall. I try not to make a fuss about it but I am actually panicking about where I would be able to sit down, without attracting attention to myself. I finally find a place and a couple of people in a group decide to sit next to the empty spots next to mine. They're talking, having a lot of fun, asking each other about how last night's party was and what not. And I'm just there, probably they're oblivious to me even being there. Once lecture finishes, and classes are done for the day, I immediately walk back to my room. This walk back is often filled with bitterness and intense feeling of loneliness, as I pass by other students walking with their friends. The worst part of all this is that I can't figure out why I am the way I am now. Why could I function normally, and live without fear back home but once here I'm afraid of the outside world. I'm afraid of the eyes that aren't probably even looking in my direction, of the laughter I hear around me, thinking that it must be at my expense, while simultaneously knowing that it isn't.

I'll give some background... I am a 16 year old male. I have suffered from social anxiety/phobia for the past 3 or 4 years. I have no idea what went wrong or where. I used to be able to go the shop on my own, but now... I don't even go there. I am too scared. Even in broad daylight... I am petrified of going. I don't know who I'll bump into or whatever. I think my anxiety is because I am fearful of what people are capable of. I am a very weary person, and I trust no-one to begin with. I really dislike it when someone says it's just because I'm shy. NO. It's not. You don't quite know how I feel. This is more than being shy. It's fear. I have never been one to make a fuss of anything. I have never been the 'class clown', I have only been in one detention (that was for forgetting a ruler in maths, lol) and I haven't been to the headmasters office. I feel a bit like Elliot from Mr. Robot if anyone knows what that is. I DESPISE going outside in urban areas. I cannot stand densely populated area. My parents often ask me if I want to go on a walk with them and the dog. All too often, I say no. It's not because I'm lazy; rather fearful of who's outside and who might see me. I almost hate everyone at school. Except from a few people. People I associate with. People I know and can trust. Trust has also been a big issue with me. At this moment in time, the only people I trust enough are 2 of my friends and my family. My mum is very supportive. (Not saying my dad isn't, it's just that my mum is the first port of call for me) Like I say, I never leave the house unless it's completely necessary. Maybe I hate society. I stay inside other than when I have to go to school. I hate parties. I hate crowded areas. I cannot speak on the spot if someone questions me about something. I just freeze and stutter... just pushing any old bull**** out of my trap. On a weekend, I spend probably 1/2 of my day in my room. Doing stuff on my computer or just playing games. Enough rambling on. I'll just break down my diagnosis into bullet points for the most relevant things... I cannot make eye contact I hate going outside. I dislike most people at my school I sit at my computer neigh on all day doing stuff I shouldn't be doing I cannot speak in front of people I do not know This one I HATE. If I saw someone getting bullied, hurt or anything, I would probably do nothing because I would be too scared to do anything about it. I CANNOT HELP THIS!! I am a very, very, very, very, very, very, private person. Words can't express how private I am. No-one knows much about me. (Except for family, obviously). No-one externally if you will. I am trying to get a visit into my GP.

I\\'m 14 and I believe is have had social anxiety for pretty much my entire existence so far. Let\\'s take it back to preschool. I remember looking at myself and always thinking \"I\\'m fat\". I know I was young, but I was extremely skinny, but all I saw was fat when I looked down, and actually tried to keep it a \"secret\" from school and my family.i guess the next instance started around 3rd grade. That was the summer after my great grandma died. She used to live next door, and every day I thought about seeing her. She was an amazing woman that I miss so much. After she passed, I felt at loss for quite a while. The year after, bullying started kicking in. I actually became overweight, really saw no difference than before. I was teased for being fat, or stupid, or told I \"liked boys\". I pretty much felt no need for social interactions any time after that. I know I was young, but of course that shit still happens today to me. As of my current situation, doing almost anything social wise is difficult. The best way I can describe it is like a huge amount of embarrassment before the actual event. But it\\'s really worse than I am describing it. It feels like any action I take in some sort of social area (school, restaurant, store, park, ect.) someone there is either watching me do it and thinking badly of me, which I hate, or I am constantly going over in my had be bad things people will say to me. Confrontations are another big issue for me. If I want something, I would rather miss out than ask for it. It makes me feel like I am burdening someone else\\'s life for my own needs, and that they might think badly of me. This ranges anywhere from asking my brother to help me with homework to even just asking someone to point me in the direction of the soup isle in a store. It is also very difficult for me to do anything social wise that could result in me screwing up, even tho 90% of the things that get to me have a 0% screw up rate. This anxiety has gotten to the point where I cannot even enter a grocery store alone out of fear that someone is watching me (although when I am forced to, i always use self checkout) so that is most of my anxiety. I really haven\\'t told anyone how I feel about this before tonight, so I Hope you enjoyed reading about my problems...

To start things off: i\\'m 21 years old, i\\'ve been a shut-in since i ended highschool (4 years now...) and i\\'m struggling, really hard, to start something up again. Mostly out of anxiety and fear. God .. okay. So i became a shut-in after some personal issues, including trying to figure out what the hell was going on with my life... having a huge fear of failing things and getting nervous about anything social. I remember my mother telling me that it\\'s just shyness in general but i knew that it was way different, it wasn\\'t shyness, it was actual fear. I\\'m always been a little bit afraid of everything that i\\'m doing. An obvious thing is the pressure of being interesting and not a bore around others. Another one is cooking for others: it feels like they expect me to do at least a good job, but if i mess up i get a hard anxiety attack and start crying. And if i\\'m tasked to do something for someone, like a job task, which i\\'m paid for, i think about it in circles before i even do it, and i imagine what things could go wrong, and how i should do it perfectly, or else i picture people around me laughing or making fun out of me. I was kind of teased that way while growing up... Anyways, things like going outside, making phone calls, interacting with strangers all day makes me feel terrified and sick to my stomach. Work makes me anxious. I\\'m absolutely afraid of starting to work, even though i know i should. I feel like a leech to my parents. I just can\\'t bring myself to start working, because it seems to be this huge terrifying place where people are yelling at me what to do, and if i mess up i\\'m going to be punished, in the social sense. I have this screwed up idea of how the world works, even though i haven\\'t been outside... at all. It\\'s like something i rely on and believe is true even if i agree that the world doesn\\'t work that way. It\\'s hard unsticking myself from it... This is rambly. Anyways, the stupid thing is, if i force myself to go outside, and for example, take a walk... then after i\\'m done with it it doesn\\'t feel that bad. I feel, okay, i can handle this, this wasn\\'t as bad as i thought. So clearly i just have to force myself out to experience it even if it wrecks me. It\\'s still really difficult. While inside, shielded from the outside world, a (figurative) voice in the back of my head tells me that the outside world is still scary, and the times i\\'ve been taking a walk doesn\\'t matter. I feel like i\\'m completely submitting myself to the inner fear, \\'ego\\', whatever whenever this happens. It tells me that i should feel scared, and worry about things, and think \"what if\"... it fools me in to thinking that it\\'s for my own best. I can recognize this yet i feel powerless to change it. Until i actually take the first step, which feels like the hardest thing in the universe, and it dissolves right in front of me. I recently did an experiment with my boyfriend, where, when he would be brutally honest and criticize my bad habits (which i\\'m thankful for) i would stop fighting and just \"give up\", something i fear a whole lot. Whenever someone would criticize me, i would feel a need to fight back, in order to prove myself, to not be seen as weak, or whatever. I gave up and admitted that i was wrong, and it gave me such a relaxed feeling that i have never felt before. It felt like i could finally relax my muscles, and stop worrying about what he, or other people thought about me, and as a consequence i didn\\'t feel any social anxiety, or any anxiety for that matter. I think this \\'ego\\' is the root of the problem, making me worry about behaving in a \"good\" way, so that people will like me. This makes sense as when i was a child/teen, people used to avoid me for some reason. So at least i have something to work with. I hate worrying about things way too much, i hate thinking about things in circles before even doing something, i hate thinking i know how it\\'s gonna play out even if it never does. I never am right in my predictions and yet i think it\\'s the safest way to go. It\\'s stupid. I wish i could do something as simple as getting a job, and handle my own life, but i can\\'t. It seems too daunting and i worry way too much about messing up and looking stupid.

My main fear when I'm in public is that I will meet or be noticed by someone I know, causing them to make false assumptions about me depending on my location and situation. E.g if someone sees me walking in a bad neighborhood, I'm afraid of them assuming I'm a criminal When I am in public WITH a friend, however, it's much easier and I get less anxiety. I freak out when I am called on by the teacher to read or present in front of the class. When my class is taking turns reading out loud, I will quickly skim through the paragraph before everyone else to prepare in case I get picked to read next When I present to the class, I stutter and can't keep my body still (moving my hands excessively, walking around, etc.) Unless they are my close friends or family, I stutter and tend to look down when I'm having a conversation with another person. I get anxiety when making or receiving phone calls. When I receive a call, I ignore it and later text the person saying that I was busy I reread my emails and make revisions several times before sending them. When I want to say something out loud to another person or a group of people, I repeat the sentence in my head a few times to make sure the wording doesn't sound wrong. I hate standing up in class, whether it's to go to the restroom or to give something to the teacher. When I'm talking to someone, it helps to stand a couple of feet away from them.

So, I think I could be described as a quiet, shy, introverted (I know being shy and introverted are two different things), and reserved person. I always have been, so far, at least. I\\'m 15. It goes a little further than that though. I\\'m incredibly socially awkward, and I really don\\'t know what to say a lot of the time. If a conversation dies out, I feel like it\\'s all my fault because I\\'m not interesting. I\\'ve avoided Skype calls with a close friend numerous times because of this, and I feel like every time I decline a request to call, they\\'ll stop being my friend. Like they\\'ll hate me or something, even though I know that\\'s bizarre. Also, I have friends I\\'ve met online that I\\'ve known for well over a year now, and I even feel uncomfortable talking in calls with them, so I usually lie and say that I can\\'t talk right now, and just type instead. I also hate going outside, ever since I was a kid. My sister loved(s) going to the park; I didn\\'t want to, I wanted stay inside all day, but my mum made me go. But recently it\\'s gotten worse. A lot worse. I took a day off school two weeks ago. I pretended to be sick. Long story short, I\\'m not exactly in a happy place right now, and I just couldn\\'t go in. Fake smiling, fake laughing - I was sick of it. Then there\\'s also, what I can only presume, are panic/anxiety attacks (quickened breathing, shaky hands, tight throat). Which is kind of why I\\'m here. I\\'ve only ever had one of these (I think) months ago, way back at the start of 2016 in my house. And that sucked like hell. Now I\\'ve started to get them at school. They usually occur just after a maths lesson has finished. I just get this overwhelming feeling of fear, and all I could think was \"What the fuck is wrong with me? I need to get out of here now,\" and \"There\\'s nothing wrong with you, it\\'s all in your head; man up.\" \"Man up\" - that phrase has been drilled into me. After the bell goes and we get to leave, I usually go straight to the toilets in one of cubicles and stay there for 5-10 minutes (during break/lunch break) to calm down. Then I have to leave so I don\\'t look weird and my friend(s) ask me where I\\'ve been. That brings me to today, I pretended to be sick again today to have the day off. Same reasons - unhappy and panic/anxiety attacks. I also feel constantly uncomfortable in social situations (so, all 6 hours of school. Yay), I have a big fear of judgement of others and base my self-worth on that - which is why I have very little of that, but also self-esteem and confidence. I only ever feel normal (mostly) when alone, and even then I\\'m thinking how I have to get up at an absurdly early time in the morning to go to a school I hate and talk to people when I\\'d rather shut myself in all day.

            "{'sequence': '(\\' High school baggage (self-therapy; long rambling). I\\'m trying to work through some stuff in my own head, so no one needs to read or reply to this. I visited my high school on the pretext of seeing the new renovations, but I actually just wanted to feel like I could walk everywhere without fear. Even though I graduated five years ago, I still felt nervous. Even though the school is on winter break and campus was empty, I found myself hesitant to walk where there were usually people. Even five years later, my automatic reaction was to walk away the moment I thought I heard someone and to put on my practiced facial expression as if someone were watching me. I was still scared to walk around campus, but I made myself do it (albeit there was no one there), telling myself that this is my campus too, that I didn\\'t have to run away and that I have a right to be there. High school was about hiding. During lunch, I sat behind pillars and bushes, in bathrooms, classrooms and locker rooms. I walked quickly from class to class with my head down. I stayed in a corner in the library as much as I could. I didn\\'t have a single friend in high school in spite of my initial efforts to reach out to people. I joined a soccer team; I quit because of the name-calling. I joined voice lessons; I quit because of the name-calling. On my first day of class in my first year, someone came to sit next to me, but his friend pulled him away saying loudly, \"I\\'m not sitting next to *her*.\" These were all people I\\'d never met, I was totally new to the school district. In math class, my table group never worked problems with me. Instead, they ignored me, talking to each other in another language, sometimes about me, not even realizing that I understood everything they said. A few times, I tried to sit with people during lunch, people I had met and managed to talk to in a friendly way during class, but they all got up and left together each time. Of course I had to save my dignity and stop acting desperate. From day one, I was marked as a pariah. I don\\'t know why or how I became the constant outcast except that I was new to the district. But for four years, I couldn\\'t eat before or at school. I developed a binge-eating disorder, which still comes up once in a while. I shut down and did nothing but academically-oriented work, never going to a social situation, except prom, which my parents forced me to attend. Those same people I had talked to before said I could join them, probably because it would be rude to say no outright. But of course they walked away and avoided me the whole event. Visiting the high school campus was painful. Objectively, I know that all of this is in the past and that I should be able to move on. But the reality is that the SA that I face every day is in large part due to the ostracizing and name-calling from high school. The past is still a living part of the present. I thought that by visiting campus, I could get some closure. Instead, it\\'s dredged up all the stuff I try not to think about. The only thing I can say is that I can see a bit more clearly what my behavioral pattern is--hiding and making myself as invisible as possible because if they can\\'t see you, they can\\'t hurt you. But I\\'ve gotten so used to making myself as invisible and unobtrusive as possible that I can\\'t make friends. I\\'ve never dated. The one time I mustered the courage to ask a guy to hang out with me, he invited his roommate to join, making it a group activity and proceeded to leave me with her. Writing that out makes me realize how calculated that was; that was actually quite mean. I\\'m always on the defense from people and their attention. But all of this isolation hurts. I\\'m hurting myself in the present because other people hurt me in the past and because I\\'m convinced that people will hurt me in the future. I don\\'t know how I can try anymore. It must be so nice to be normal and be able to share the world with people, without fear, instead of feeling like you\\'re imprisoned in your own head. \\')', 'labels': ['not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with negative effect', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect'], 'scores': [0.7623303532600403, 0.0925942212343216, 0.07981837540864944, 0.0652569979429245]}\n",

I don\\'t know where to start or what to say or how much to say but all I know is that I need help Long story short I moved countries for my boyfriend and a couple years later and I think I\\'ve gained some unhealthy habits and I have huge social anxiety now and feel completely vulnerable and alone and it\\'s ruining my relationship as well as myself. Here is some more background info for anyone who may be able to give me any good advice, I would really appreciate it. I\\'m a 20 yr old female and I fell in love a couple years ago and moved countries for my boyfriend, we are still together and i believe things are much better than before. You have no idea how hard this move has been on me. I used to be so happy and outgoing and have my close few friends and old high school friends. I used to do my own thing, I used to be so independent. First let me say that I love my boyfriend incredibly and we both plan to spend the rest of our lives together and have a family, build our home and we are already working on our business together. It has been a couple years and I still don\\'t know how to speak the language here. I do not have a car or a drivers license and I work from home. I feel I am so reliant on him for everything. I feel I am so needy and attached to him always. We spend every day together and yes we take our space but I wouldn\\'t want it any different. Now with the crime etc here and with how I stand out we both aren\\'t comfortable with me taking the bus let alone running in the area we live. This is another problem. I know a group of people that speak English and we sort of get along but I feel no matter what I do not click with any of the girls here. I have always had troubles being friends with girls though, they don\\'t seem to take a liking to me and I\\'ve accepted that and continue to be as nice and genuine as possible. I used to have a bunch of guy friends but now that I am in a serious relationship ( I should note this is my first relationship ) I don\\'t think that it is very appropriate to make close guy friends but I get along well with my boyfriend\\'s friends though. With the language I\\'ve been excusing it and excusing it and Now that I live here I feel I have become shy because I hate being laughed at for not knowing the language, I get so much anxiety when we are out and there is lots of people and my boyfriend is talking to people I don\\'t seem to recognize or know, or even people I do know and it\\'s in their own language and I just close in and feel so alone and so invisible to everyone. I try to learn a bit but guess I get frustrated and shut down easily. I am forcing myself to pay for 1on1 private lessons though and I feel this is a huge block that is one of the main problems for me. I hate being the center of attention as well and I think that I am a very insecure woman now that I am in this relationship. The way I think about myself can at times be terrible, I\\'m great for overthinking and my poor boyfriend gets to deal with it all. I know that from a young age because of dad issues or whatever I have abandonment problems and although I think my boyfriend would never and know that he has never done anything behind my back involving another woman I still feel like I will lose him at times and I feel like i am not good enough. As you can probably tell I have serious insecurities about myself, what I believe are abandonment issues, social anxiety, a language barrier, I am too dependent on him, uncomfortable to walk the streets alone, a hard time making friends, a hard time even going out of my comfort zone, sometimes suffer from bouts of depression etc and it is hard on both me and my boyfriend. I broke down yesterday because I was holding it all in for so long and I didn\\'t want my boyfriend to know because honestly he is so used to me crying I feel like it doesn\\'t even phase him but he came in the room and I couldnt hide it anymore and he actually cried with me because he couldn\\'t believe how I was feeling about myself etc. But today we went to an event and it was so overwhelming for me there was so many people and I started panicking inside and tried to keep it to myself but he sensed it and then as we were leaving I asked if he wanted to get a beer before we went to this other event (work) and he said no and that we had to go to that event right away but then he saw his friend opened a bar and we went to say hi and the guys completely ignored me and they all talked to eachother in their language and again it hit me and I felt so worthless to be standing there just looking at the ground trying to keep it together and then he asks me if we can have a beer with them and that stung because I just got turned down when I asked. We ended up leaving anyway and he noticed I was a little upset and I asked him about the beer thing and the friends who wouldn\\'t even look at me and then he started getting pissed off and He makes this comment \"why can\\'t we go just one day without it turning bad \" and I started crying and there was a point I was upset with him and said fuck you and had a short rant and he said \"you don\\'t even try to get better\" \"I don\\'t deserve this\" \"I can\\'t even say hi to my friends\", he totally lost his cool and was yelling and speeding at times and I just kept fucking crying, he also asked why for once I can\\'t make it all about me and even though i feel he took things way too far I understand and I feel like a peice of shit and am so upset with myself. Please why can\\'t I be fucking normal again I feel almost trapped right now but when I\\'m good things are amazing but no when he tells me that stuff I just feel like it would be better if I just left for good. I am hurting so much. Please someone help talk to me I have no one to go to and he was the only one I poured my heart and soul to. He knows everything about me, but when he goes and says this I feel like he just doesn\\'t care and I feel I\\'d be better off gone. But when I think about it he is my everything. He is all I have.

            "{'sequence': \"('What is it?. Hi, I'm a 22 year old male from the UK. It has just hit me that I might be suffering from some form of social anxiety. I know it's not something you can easily diagnose, as being shy is common and often just a stage in someones life, but I think it's more than shyness for me. I can speak to other people fine, and will smile at the barista or laugh with somebody if the situation is so, so I wouldn't class myself as shy. I can hold a conversation with a stranger well enough. What I think is my problem is that I always feel like I have to prepare myself before I go out. Regardless of how well I think I'm dressed, or whether I have a fresh haircut or whatever, I feel unready to be in the gaze of others if I'm not physically and mentally prepared. If I don't know that I'm being looked at/am in the presence of others or if I'm not prepared mentally to be looked at/to be in the presence of others, I feel very uncomfortable. Don't ask me what my mental preparation is, because I have no clue. My physical preparation is fairly normal for a young male, it's just the mental side. I also just always feel like I'm being watched when I'm walking in public. Like everyone I pass stares at me for a second longer than they do at other people, because I don't fit in. Truth is, I look 'normal'. I'm from an ethnic minority, but who the hell cares about that (especially at uni). I don't think I look particularly attractive or unattractive. The issue came to fruition in Uni, when I began to be out and about more generally. I was a bit overweight, but not by majorly so, and my self-consciousness with that made me hate being in public. I'd want to be out of sight as soon as possible, and it was like a massive burden was lifted off my shoulders when I'd reach my room. Since then I've lost a lot of weight so that I'm really like any other young adult male (if a bit on the skinny side, but that's because I'm into running), and yet the feeling of being out of place still hasn't changed. I'm still at uni (in my final year), and it has improved a lot. Losing weight helped, and generally becoming more comfortable with how I look. I think that was one of my major problems. I was very self conscious with my looks. I hated the way I looked with glasses because I thought it made me look even weirder, to the extent that I wouldn't wear glasses when my prescription is such that I should wear them all the time. I'd rather be basically blind and live in a blur than to look that extra bit weirder. That continued on for a long while, until I realised that it was affecting how people I knew thought of me because they'd pass right by me or wave at me and I'd blank them because I couldn't see them. That's different now, I think I've come to terms with my image. I look different, but I'm fine with that because we all do, and I'm no beast or whatever. I'm a lot more comfortable in public too and will go out even when I don't particularly need to, but there's still that something that makes me falter before I go out in the morning, and sometimes I don't even want to leave my room. That is what has made me think that there's something more to my condition than just having body image issues. There's no better feeling than getting back into my room and being out of sight after a long day at uni. I read somewhere that this is just a symptom of being an introvert, but I don't think I am your usual introvert. I enjoy meeting new people, and sometimes I really crave it. It's not social interactions that exhaust me, because I get this need to hide away after simply being out and having not even talked to anyone. So is this the right place for me? Do you think I have social anxiety issues? I don't think it is the body image issues that I've had in years gone by, but then again I've never really looked for professional help for anything like this. I don't know.. honestly I'd just be glad if there was someone else who had the same issues, someone that I could to talk to about them? Thanks for reading all of that. It's the first time I've ever actually typed out my feelings about it, and really is a relief in itself, so thanks for being a part of that even if there is nothing you can suggest.')\", 'labels': ['not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect', 'related to an outdoor space with negative effect'], 'scores': [0.8053944110870361, 0.08333482593297958, 0.06582634896039963, 0.04544439911842346]}\n",

            "{'sequence': '(\\'22M, live abroad is killing me. Hello reddit, I moved to Europe, when I was 14. My mother already lived there for 3 years and I lived in Ukraine with my grandparents. I was never really asked if I wanted to move but I also didn\\'t think about living in other country and leaving everything behind as a big problem. First half of the year was a horror. I spoke to almost no one. I learned German for a year prior to moving to Europe and it was not enough for me to instantly make friends. Also, the last couple of years at school in Ukraine were pretty difficult for me, as I was constantly bullied. I was weak and skinny and didn\\'t know how to protect myself. But even then, I didn\\'t have any other problems outside school. So, back to Europe, from my first days here, I tried to speak to my new schoolmates as good as I could. But I also started to shield myself from people. Like, if I try to look unfriendly or dangerous, nobody will try to make fun of me. I behaved myself like this, when I was in public. It\\'s not, like I was being impolite to people, but I tried to always have this \"don’t mess with me look\", if this makes any sense. However, knew country, new rules. I didn\\'t have to be afraid of being attacked physically. Instead I couldn’t argue or counter jokes from my classmates. This time I was vulnerable not, because I was weak, but because I didn\\'t know the language well. I also went to a second school simultaneously. My week looked like this: twice a week a returned home at 8pm, because of two schools, where I hadn\\'t time to go home between them. The rest of time I had to study. My first winter holidays, which I spent back in Ukraine, were both a relieve and a horror. I had to go privately to a German teacher almost daily. In first summer I had about 3-4 teachers to prepare me for both schools. All this was awful, but stilly I had my friends at home and was overall happy. **Until one day it started.** I was going back from my German teacher (who was a really nice person, and who taught me really a lot grammar, that helped me immense with my German, so it\\'s not like I totally hated learning German). But let\\'s go back. So, I was going back from my \"class\". I was a usual way for me: just a bit uphill along the road towards the bus stop. Suddenly it was more difficult for me to breath and I felt like, if I would start breath more, people would notice it and, that I looked really awkward. After that, I drove back home and felt myself completely normal. But this situation repeated itself more and more during that summer. I started to notice the way I breathe even on my way to the teacher. I think, this is where it all started. As I was back in Europe, I started being conscious about how I move my feet or my arms. I was always aware of where I was looking at, how my lip was positioned. I didn\\'t know how to look in people\\'s eyes, whether I looked unfriendly etc. I still had no friends at European school, I haven\\'t had any walks which I had constantly with my friends back in Ukraine. It looked like the kids where either going out the way I didn\\'t understand or the didn\\'t do it at all. Years went by, the only time I enjoyed my life, was when I had winter or summer holidays and was back in Ukraine. There I could talk to people, I even managed to make new friends, with whom I still have good contact. I just felt myself normal. After about 2-3 years later, I managed to tell my mother, that something was wrong with me. (It\\'s not easy for a kid to admit, that something is wrong with his head! And I didn\\'t have a good connection to my mother at that time) She took me to her psychiatrist. I was prescribed with some weak antidepressant. I guess I helped with my mood a bit, but it had done shit to my social anxiety. I just tried to suppress the way I felt and had from time to time breakdowns. My only dream was to finish school and University and leave that fucking country. Since no one here needed me, I decided, I would manage everything on my own. I finished both schools. It may sound like it isn\\'t bad after all. Well, no. All this time it felt like I lost that autopilot and had to manually control the way I move, or where to look at the person I speak to. I still didn\\'t feel connected to people around me. I could not make jokes, which the class would find funny. I didn\\'t speak to anyone outside my class. I felt isolated and people around me perceived me the same way. I wasn\\'t interested in my future carrier or, in what to study. My only dream was to leave this country. Instead of leaving, I thought, that it would be a waste to give up an opportunity to study in Europe. I also didn\\'t want to disappoint my relatives. And, to be honest, I was afraid to change anything, go back home and take exams to be able study there. I also didn\\'t want to look like an idiot, coming back, when everybody else wanted to leave Ukraine for better future. I think, I should have done that. If not for studying, but just to have a year off, relax, get rid of SA and may be come back to study. (It\\'s important to mention, that most of the social anxiety symptoms weaken, after I get back home for, at least a month. But even from the first day on, I always felt myself a lot better ) But I haven\\'t done that. Instead I thought, I could power myself thought University, get a bachelor and leave this fucking country forever. I tried studying two different faculties, I hoped, that at the University I would finally able to connect to new people and have fun (so that I would even decide to stay in Europe). That never happened. I tried to study mechanical engineering, but from the beginning the math was just unmanageable for me and I couldn’t find a group to study together. Well, if I can\\'t have fun talking to someone new, since I am to anxious, I can\\'t fit in a group to study, because you must speak there and, like, make friends :) In Europe there are no persistent classes at the Universities. You either have a lection in a huge auditorium or have smaller classes, with 20-40 persons for something like practicing math, where you must solve your prepared homework in front of whole group. I had to do it twice and I felt almost like I am fainting. The most time I spent at home, where I didn\\'t have to feel constant fear and be in fight or flight mode. During one summer in Ukraine I met my current girlfriend. Later, I decided to study CS at a so-called University of Applied Science, where after three years of fixed classes I would have my bachelor and could go back to Ukraine. I had to wait almost a year to sign me up for that University. In the meantime, I found a job, where I am basically all levels of support and a junior sysadmin at same time. (Back in European school a had a specialization in IT because of which we had one year more of school. And the specialization made me hate IT so much, that I didn\\'t realize, that I actually like it) The job was fantastic the only \"problem\" was, that every year in August they organized an event for different political, technical, economical, etc topics) and I had to be there for month. During that time I had both to do IT Stuff and help prepare everything for the conference (cheap student labor :D) But that one month of constant work (not 8/5) just crushed me. My anxiety escalated to some new levels, I was constantly stressed. I was still extra anxious after work but also looked forward to study something I wanted, the way I thought could be the best for me. I expected, that only mathematics would be hard for me, but I also knew you that it would not be as difficult as in a normal University. I was so fucking wrong about everything. The amount of information was huge. We had constant projects in most of the classes. Moreover, there are supposed to be a lot of group projects. The groups where created all by themselves. I didn\\'t want to be that person without a group and be assigned to somebody I didn\\'t like. All of this made me extremely anxious. Additionally, to my social anxiety I became anxious about everything else. I had to finish every assignment, otherwise I would fail either the final project or the test and then after 3 repeat I would have to repeat the semester. And if you didn\\'t manage to do the first assignment, you will still have to do it, since every next assignment is built upon previous. But most important, I could not manage to make social contacts. I was truly afraid of people. It seems, like we have no similar interests. I still do not know how to connect to them. People in Europe just feel so alien to me. Here in Europe, at my University I felt like a totally different person. I had a lot of breakdowns, I started to cry in the evening and I somehow managed to survive till end of the December and have two weeks off, during which I had to prepare for math exam. But still I was in Ukraine with my girlfriend. What was really killing me is, that I still can perfectly speak to my Ukrainian friends, we can argue, discuss stuff, make fun of each other etc. I have a very nice and understanding girlfriend. I have no problems socializing with them. Or even with meeting new people in Ukraine. After final exams my girlfriend was here with me in Europe, and I still could not relax. When we were in public I constantly was afraid, that I cannot protect her, due to my SA. I also failed two exams and had to retake them after holidays, which made me even more anxious. My doctor gave me some new medication, which, for two weeks seemed to lower my social anxiety and it felt awesome. I already lost my belief that there could be any meds that could really help me. And that belief was restored. The only thing I feared, is that it won\\'t hold, like with all previous things that seemed to help me. And, well, it didn\\'t hold. Something happened during the weekends, I can\\'t explain what it is. But it set me off. My fear became true. The amount of work for the University increased even more and became unbearable to me. At this point I cry for hours. Last week I spent home, constantly anxious. At this point, I don\\'t know what to do. I should have left this country for a year after school. Now I feel, like I can\\'t do it. I also feel, like I am already too old to stop studying and make a pause. I don\\'t think, that I will be able to finish this semester, since I have already fallen behind all the classes. I also get very anxious if I try to study and more anxious after every minor difficulty. My relatives think, that it wasn’t that bad previously. I think, I just was very good at suppressing it and just can\\'t take it anymore. When I felt myself worse, I was usually prescribed new medication, talked to the therapist. After that I felt a bit better and it was enough to continue suppressing and working on \"more\" important things. How long can a person live in a foreign country feeling lonely? I know, that there are people, to whom I am interesting, who like me and care about me. My family is also very supportive. But it\\'s not them, who feel anxious about going outside. It\\'s me who is constantly afraid of masses of people, who can\\'t relax outside and can\\'t protect myself from. Any verbal or nonverbal assault. It almost feels like I am at a warzone. I remember, when I didn\\'t care, how people look at me, ignored if somebody was rude to me. I was able to respond the way I wanted. My head wasn\\'t empty. Now I just slowly fall apart. I am not suicidal, I guess, because I don\\'t believe in the afterlife and am afraid of death. Hell, I even was more relaxed during this two weeks in Ukraine in winter. It wasn\\'t enough time, but I felt myself free on the streets. You probably gonna say, why the hell wouldn\\'t I leave. I know, people would support my decision, I could probably come back later. But I don\\'t won\\'t to let down my girlfriend, even if she says, I don\\'t. I didn\\'t finish a university, so nobody would really want to have me work for them and I want to work, so that I won\\'t be an abuse. I know my options. I just don\\'t have the will to make a decision. I feel like I would get better a bit, like usual and would continue ignoring the problem and maybe in 5 years will slowly finish CS at the University. I just don\\'t think, it is going to be a life. Maybe you together with my girlfriend, it would be easier. I don\\'t know, why am I even writing this. I don’t know, whether it’s a right subreddit. Even posting something on the internet makes me anxious. I do not know, what I want to hear from you. Therefore, I will just share this story and hope for something. I also hope, I won’t be deanonymized by somebody. I just feel, like for the last 8 years, I lived only episodically, not being able to open my true potential or take the opportunities, I was given. And I feel like I am slowly going insane. I hope, that this text isn\\'t totally unreadable, since I guess, English is not even my second language . I tried to keep it as short as possible, but I also don’t expect, that anybody would like to read almost 3k words text. **TL;DR** A lot of autobiographical stuff. Moving abroad as a kid literally ruined my nervous system as the years passed by. And my will was never strong enough to decide, what is really important for me and to change my life the way I really wanted. Now, I just can\\'t take my social anxiety anymore and overcome any difficulties of being an adult. The difference between, who I am in one country, and who I am in another is just killing me.\\')', 'labels': ['related to an outdoor space with negative effect', 'not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect'], 'scores': [0.25849485397338867, 0.25407856702804565, 0.24722883105278015, 0.24019768834114075]}\n",

            "{'sequence': \"('My Social Anxiety. I wrote this as a bit of a vent for myself but thought I would post it here because I’m sure many of you can relate to this. It’s a bit long but here goes... As a kid I was always “shy.” I wouldn’t make direct eye contact with people most of the time. I would put my head down in situations where I had to meet new people. At family gatherings I would mostly keep to myself only talking to people if they asked me a question. Even then, it would usually be a short response. In school I didn’t have many friends. I had more in elementary than I did in middle school. More in middle school than in high school. I can count the number of real friends I had in high school on one hand. It sure didn’t help that I went to three different high schools throughout my high school years. One of those I left and returned to a few times. I changed elementary schools in the 4th grade, and then changed middle school in the beginning of 7th grade. So it didn’t make it any easier to make friends with people that already had established groups of friends that they had grown up with. I remember hearing this girl in my class talking to her friends about how it was weird that we keep leaving and coming back. (We being my sister and I) In high school people thought I was rude or mean because I didn’t talk to anyone. The truth is I just didn’t know how. I wanted to have friends. I didn’t want to be popular or anything but who doesn’t want to have their own circle of friends and people to relate to? Even the people I “dated” didn’t get to know the real me because I was too afraid to be myself. I don’t know why I felt this way. I’m sure it has something to do with my developmental years but I’m not an expert. Going to school every day was hell. Thinking that everyone is judging you all the time or talking about you or laughing at you is rough. Being made fun of for being “too skinny” or “too quiet” or “too rude” is rough. I would walk in every morning with headphones in and make a beeline for the classroom and I would leave the same way. I wonder if you know what this social anxiety feels like? It can come and go at anytime. Some days are worse than others. Some days it’s insomnia, heart racing, palms sweating, mind racing. It’s uncontrollable and it feels like you’re mind is going to explode from the craziness inside it. Some days it lurks in the background. On those days it’s manageable. You can go to the movies or to the mall and feel somewhat okay. Some days it’s canceling plans you’ve had for weeks because you just can’t bring yourself to leave the house and face human interaction. You can’t face the feeling of everyone’s eyes on you and the negativity that you assume is associated with you. You can’t force yourself to act like you’ve got it together in front of other people. It’s too hard to put on a smile and make conversation. The hardest part for me is self doubt. I’m always second guessing what I’m doing. Always thinking someone is watching. Always afraid of messing up. It’s also people thinking I’m lazy because I don’t work and when I do it never lasts too long. Even the job I have now which is a good job with good pay, it’s hard. It’s hard forcing myself out of bed in the morning knowing for the next twelve hours I’m going to be mentally exhausted which is much worse than the physical exhaustion. That may seem like an over statement to you but it’s not for me. Walking down the long walk ways at work hoping no ones walking the opppsite direction. What do I do when I cross someone’s path? Do I make eye contact? Do I look straight ahead? Do I smile? Nod? Wave? Am I rude if I just look down or away? These are all thoughts going through my head. As irrational as they are, they’re real. What happens when everyone is standing in a group talking? Do I go and try to be part of the group? But then I have to talk to people. But if I don’t I just look like a weirdo or like I think I’m too good to talk to them. What if I think I know how to do something at work but I’m not sure and I’m afraid to mess up so I ask someone for help? Then I feel dumb because I should’ve just done what I thought was right in the first place. Sometimes I avoid doing things altogether just so I can’t fail and look dumb in front of my co workers. But doing nothing also makes me look lazy and like I’m not a team player. Do you understand the problem? This is also the reason I don’t drive. I know I’m capable of driving and would probably enjoy it, but I’m terrified of taking the driving test. I can’t bring myself to go and be on the spot like that. I don’t even want to drive in front of my fiancé so how am I supposed to do it for a test in front of a stranger? Everyone tells me you need to get your license. It’s such an obvious and easy thing for everyone else but for me it’s the hardest thing in the world. It’s the same reason I wouldn’t cut the grass when I was younger. I didn’t want people to watch me out in the front yard anyone passing by could and I didnt want to mess up and cut it poorly. I hope this will help you understand what this anxiety is like for me. It’s not getting better. In fact it’s gotten worse. I’m getting more general anxiety now. Unreasonable worrying about things I have no control over. Checking to see if my loved ones are still breathing when they sleep or worrying about getting into car accidents. Living with this anxiety is getting harder and harder. All I want to do is give up and just lay in bed at home in a safe place all the time. I’m looking into getting help because this is too much to handle and I just want to feel normal for the first time in my life.

Hello, This is going to be a little long, but please take the time to read this. I don’t know what to do. I’m not trying to gain sympathy or pity, I just need to pour my heart out. I’m 20. I’m a boy. I have social anxiety. It’s something I struggled with my whole life. In school I was always quiet because I was very shy. Students used to always ask me “Why are you so quiet?” Teachers would call my parents and tell them “Your son is very quiet.” My parents would get mad at me because of it. When we would visit family, I was always quiet and in my shell. They would ask me, “Why are you so quiet? You can open up.” I was always shy and uncomfortable around family I didn’t see very often. My father always scolded me after we visited his family for being so quiet and acting uncomfortable around them. I spent a lot of time in the house. My father never liked that. He always wanted me to go outside and play with the other kids in the neighborhood, but I never wanted to out of fear. He would always give me a hard time for always being alone and not having friends. He would say, “You’re always alone, you have no friends.” I know I don’t have any friends and I’m always alone. It was very hurtful to listen to him and hear that, but he’s right. The truth hurts. He still says it to this day. I would talk to people in school, but I would never hang out with them outside of school. I couldn’t take that next step. And people never wanted to hang out with me anyway. They would never ask me if I wanted to hang out with them. They never asked for my phone number. I could never open up to people. I was always awkward and uncomfortable with other students in school. They definitely picked up on that. I went to the same school district since third grade, and I don’t have a single friend from there. My anxiety hit rock bottom out of nowhere during my freshman year of high school. It could be attributed to the fact I was going through puberty and my hormones were raging or it just progressively got worse. I started developing so many issues that were not a problem prior. I started having a hard time making eye contact with people. Being sensitive to how people look at me. If I get dirty looks from someone or a weird look, I feel like something is wrong with me and I’m devastated. When I’m out for a walk and someone is approaching me I either put my face down and look at the ground to avoid eye contact or I try to make the effort to make eye contact with the passerby, but they just look at me funny and I feel awkward. Going out for car rides and feeling like people in other cars are looking at me and judging me. Going out for walks with other people around. People noticing that I’m nervous or uncomfortable and judging me for it. Walking into a room full of people with all eyes on me. Always feeling like people are staring at me and judging me. Just so many issues that became so severe. I always had anxiety, but during my freshman year of high school my anxiety got much worse. Prior to this, my anxiety wasn’t that bad. I was more care-free. It was easier for me to interact with people. I was able to enjoy life more. The issues I started developing weren’t much of an issue in the past. I became so upset that my anxiety gotten worse. I let my mind convince myself that I’m never going to get better. I’m doomed to have social anxiety for the rest of my life. I’m never going to be able to go back to how I was before my freshman year of high school. Going out period around other people became too anxiety inducing for me, so I became a shut-in. I went through the rest of high school with debilitating anxiety. During sophomore year, I started eating lunch in the counseling office because eating in the cafeteria with all the other students became too overwhelming for me. I always walked with a book in my hand for a comfort. I was and still am very self-conscious of the way I walk. People say I walk very stiff or like a robot. Going to school everyday made me extremely nervous. Sitting in the classroom amongst other students and feeling like everyone is staring at me. Walking the hallways. Giving presentations. High school was hell. However I made it through and I graduated. I started college and I didn’t have the college experience. I struggled with anxiety. I just stayed in my dorm all day and did nothing. I didn’t make any friends, join any clubs/organizations, party, etc. I was too afraid to open up. I was too afraid to step outside of my comfort zone and make friends and just have fun. People would try to be my friend, but I was never comfortable. Everyone around me was having the time of their lives, making friends, etc. It was depressing because I wasn’t having any of that. I don’t even want to go back to school next year. I have no life. I just sit in the house all day everyday. I don’t work because I’m too afraid to get a job. How am I going to get through the interview? What if my coworkers won’t like me? What if my manager won’t like me? What if customers or my coworkers think I’m weird because I’m socially awkward? I try to get out of the house, but being out just makes me nervous. I want to have friends and I want to have a life. I feel like I have so much to offer, I just need to get past this awful fear. I go on social media and look at people I went to school with. They are having the time of their lives while I sit on my behind and do nothing. It’s upsetting. I have no personality. I feel like a robot. Everytime I interact with people in public I’m very stiff and robotic. People tell me I’m extremely nice, but honestly I feel like I have no personality. I can’t open up to people. I’m never comfortable and I’m always on edge. I’m living in fear. I just feel like I’m doomed to have social anxiety for the rest of my life. It has gotten so severe to the point where I don’t think I can ever recover. Sorry for the long post, but I needed to pour my feelings out. I’m sick of people telling me I’m just a lazy bum. People don’t know that I’m suffering with debilitating anxiety that’s affecting my life.

I’m sick and tired of it, literally, this anxiety is physically and mentally exhausting. I wish it wasn’t a struggle to just get up in the morning, that just a simple fracking hello leaves me with hours of unease and regret that I did it wrong. Yeah, yeah, call me crazy, call me irrational, but frick, it’s real and I’ve dealt with it almost every day since I can remember. People tell me that I shouldn’t just say “I wish this” and “I wish that” and that I should just get over it or do something about it. One, frack you guys who say “just get over it”, you’ve probably never dealt with anxiety, it’s like you are carrying the weight of everyone’s judgements and eyes on you with every possibility of any and every event running through your head all the time. It’s traumatic and we live with it everyday and in the end some of us can’t take it any longer, we can’t stand the pressure of living under the umbrella of our own minds. Two, you think I’m not dealing with it? I’ve done therapy, I’ve had over half a dozen different therapists and psychologists, I’ve done the meds and meditation and I still spent over half my junior year of high school locked in my bedroom crying and trying not to end it while my mother thought I just had mono and was “tired”. I am trying, I force myself outside and to interact but it’s terrifying and people just don’t seem to get that. When you’ve lived your whole life with these voices in your head telling you that you’re useless, you’re worthless, that no one likes you or that you’ll mess everything up, it’s hard to just shut it out. They echo all the time; you want to go out for ice cream, they’ll tell you people will think your ice cream choice is weird or you’ll drop the cone all over you or on someone else. Rinse wash and repeat with any and every social situation. Yeah I’m getting better, I’m moving forward. I haven’t ended it, but frack man, it just takes one bad look, one simple “freak” or “weirdo” uttered under someone’s breath that sends me spiraling right back down to that dark place. So yeah, I wish I could just not give a frack about what people think or say but I can’t. I’m still a work in progress and at the moment that’s all I have to give.

All of these issues I still struggle with today. However, the most severe out of them is my anxiety. I worry over everything; no matter how big or small. The most insignificant thing can send me off in a fit of nerves and panic. I’m plagued with what ifs constantly. I’ve avoided social events because of anxiety. Most of my daily life is fucked up due to anxiety. My anxiety stems from the root of being afraid of messing up. As a kid, I taught myself to be a perfectionist; if I did everything perfectly I wouldn’t get in trouble. If I did everything right and was perfect inside and out, then my parents and friends and family wouldn’t have to worry about me. This has had a disastrous effect. I can’t go outside due to being so nervous of fucking up, doing something stupid, looking dumb, etc. I’ll get this knot in my stomach just thinking about going out with friends. I can’t talk to new/ somewhat familiar people because I get nervous that I’m not talking right or looking stupid or saying the wrong thing or just being overall disinteresting. Anything outside of my daily routine of work/school/home fucks me up. This also relates to new experiences. I’m scared of dating. I’m scared of sex. Whenever I think about these things I get this extreme burning sensation, a heavy fit of nerves, and I have to calm myself down because it gets so intense. I hate going on vacations because I get the what if’s and at the end of the day I just count down to the day I can be back in the safety of my own home. It’s killing me. I hate myself at the fact I can’t do regular things. I don’t have fun. My life is so mundane and basic that it frustrates me, but the anxiety and fear of the outside is what keeps me isolated. I can’t go places. I can’t talk to people. I can’t make new friends. I can’t live my life. I can’t take it anymore. It’s not even the fact that I won’t do it, I physically cannot do it.

I've sought help from others online, from self help videos and books to personally researching mental illnesses and finding strategies to combat it, but nothing has helped.

I have some kind of skin inflammation issue that has been getting worse and spreading all over my body that started in my late teens. Sleeping issues. Joint pain issues. Memory issues. Issues focusing. Issues learning and enjoying things. Anger issues. Incapability of maintaining online friendships. Social issues. The list goes on and on. I'm just really sick. Both mentally and physically. Really, what I want to do is see a therapist. An online one. I've tried everything I can on my own, but maybe talking with a therapist online could help me with my anxiety at least to a point where I can get myself outside to go to a doctor and a therapist in person.

            "{'sequence': \"('Social Anxiety: Road to Recovery. Social anxiety is an awful mental health disorder. Having suffered from it since I was 15, I understand how debilitating it can be to just go outside and how the fear before just doing the simplest of tasks can make you feel. I am making this post because, although I know this subreddit tends to be mainly memes and jokes, and I love it for that, we do all share one common thing - we all suffer/do suffer from social anxiety. And for many, this post will be useless, but when I first subscribed to this subreddit, I’d never done anything significant to truly address and deal with my mental health. I had a feeling of hopelessness that I no longer have, and if I could go back in time and give these words to myself, I would. If this post can help just one person, then I’ll be happy! But right, in the last year, I met a girl. I struggle with going to University, but I need a future. She made me NEED to get better, and I wish I had the self control to make MYSELF force myself to take steps in getting better. I know for a fact there is someone reading this who hasn’t taken these steps to try and improve their social anxiety, because the social anxiety itself prevents people from doing so. Getting help involves speaking to say, a doctor, or a therapist, and this can be a massive, scary deal. So, with having social anxiety, it can be tremendously difficult to take the first steps to recovery. This is unique, in that suffering from a mental disorder such as OCD or depression doesn’t necessarily restrict you seeking help in the sense of being unable to get yourself, on your own, to see a doctor or a therapist. However, you have to want to get better. You have to know that you deserve better, that social anxiety is NOT normal, is NOT something anyone should suffer with, and that it IS a strongly researched mental health disorder which is legitimate and known by every health professional. You need to enforce this desire, and you have to make a doctors appointment. This will create a dialogue with your GP. You have to see what support is there for you. Your GP speaks to hundreds of people every week, with a whole host of different issues, both physical and mental. Mental health is a massive public health issue and is finally being treated as such. SEE. YOUR. DOCTOR! Doing this was the best thing I ever did, even though I was terrified when I had my first appointment. I am not ashamed to admit that I had some alcohol before going, thought about cancelling in the week leading up to the appointment and was just downright terrified of going. But I did, I said that I had anxiety, in social situations, and guess what - he understood. Doctors. Don’t. Judge. I was put on a small dose of medication - was a bit weird for the first few days, as it made me lose my appetite and feel a bit weird, but it settled. You don’t notice the affects of anxiety medication too much, it takes about 6 weeks for it to have any affect. It’s likely you’ll also have your dose increased after your body settles on it. It can feel like a long process, you just want to stop having these feelings of anxiety, of dread, of fear going somewhere and having the physical symptoms of your anxiety presenting themselves and embarrassing you. But it’s just the first step to getting better - medication CAN work. Some say it doesn’t work for them, but it definitely makes some difference for some, and I am living proof of that. Next - therapy. I wouldn’t have been able to do a single therapy session if it weren’t for medication. Some will be able to, and if you are, great. Secondly, money. I live in the UK, and here the NHS offer therapy for free if the patient needs it, so I’m lucky in that sense, although the waiting list was 3 months. I am aware that in many countries, therapy isn’t cheap. However, even where money is tight, please realise that your mental state is so important, and is ABSOLUTELY worth spending money on in looking to improve it. Social anxiety is not normal, and is not something you should have to be subject to every day. You deserve to get professional help. For those who literally cannot afford therapy, I sincerely apologise and ask you to see if there is anything you can do to get the help you need. Therapy is scary, at first. But it’s also the best thing I’ve forced myself to do. You become familiar and comfortable with a therapist. They understand social anxiety, they put you at ease and remind you that this is their JOB, and that they deal with patients with social anxiety EVERY SINGLE DAY. These are things you can do, that WILL make an improvement to your social anxiety. It will make your quality of life better, and it is absolutely worth doing. You only get one life on this earth, don’t live yours in the shackles of social anxiety because you deserve better.

Messaging people first 2. Exercising 3. Wearing short clothing in public 4. Meeting potential partners 5. Needing alcohol to speak to people I don\\'t know too well 6.

I\\'m always \"alert\" for subtle cues that they make in order to confirm my suspicions. A friend of mine never responds anyway so I\\'ve stopped trying, even though I would love to keep up the friendship. My old friends from high school never messaged me first so I convinced myself that I upset them, so we eventually lost touch. In my defence, any time I do message first, they rarely respond and if I try to make plans, they never accept. I found out recently that they made plans without me which definitely hurt. I suppose I\\'m looking for a fresh perspective on the situation. I don\\'t exercise. At all. My local park is always full of people so I don\\'t go there, and the gym is always full and leads into my next issue (short clothing).

Hi, I’m 13 male and i like to play street basketball with friends, play soccer and play basketball on my school team. So anyways i have something that is still really bothering me that happened 2 days ago. I was hanging out with my friend after school and his name is Dylan. We were wanting to get a street basketball game going so we called a bunch of guys and planned on playing in a hour. We had 8 guys interested. My brother was also interested and wanted to play so we said he could play. Then my mom said little later. I have a doctor appointment booked for you in 30 minutes and you have to go before you can play with your friends. She suggested all 4 of us (me, my bro, dylan) drive together to my doctor appointment and then she would drive us to the game. I said ok and quickly ran upstairs to my bedroom and put on my basketball jersey with shorts on. Then i said i’m ready to go. So we all drove to the doctors. Once we were there we didn’t have to wait long because it was booked already and the nurse comes to the waiting room and calls my name. I get up and saw my bro and dylan still sitting. I told them they could come too if they want. My mom then said are you sure because your your going to get a physical exam done. I didn’t know what that was and thought it meant was going to be showing how physical fast and strong i am. So they know im not weak for my age. So i told them yeah i don’t mind them coming in. So we got in the doctors room and we are waiting for 5 minutes and the doctor walks in. He says hi to me and my mom and then notices my friend and brother sitting in the room too. He then said are you sure you want your brother or friend in here when we do your physical exam? I said i don’t mind. Still not know what that really means. The doctor then said ok can you sit on the bed and take off your jersey? so checked my heartbeat and measured my waist. Then said ok can you remove your shorts. I was wondering why he was telling me to do this and was little embarrassed taking my shorts off in front of my brother and friend because both of them have never saw my in my underwear before or naked. Besides when i was 5 years old having a bath with my brother was the last time. So i take off my shorts and he told me to lay on the bed. So i did and pushing my tummy and using this triangle thing on my knee that makes my knee jump. He then told me he needs to check my bowels so told me to lay on my side facing away from everyone. He then lowers my underwear and my butt is now showing to everyone and i was so embarrassed! i could hear my bro and dylan giggling a bit. So then the doctor uncomfortably puts his finger in me and kinda hurt and then it was done and got me to stand up. I felt really embarrassed already and noticed my friend holding his phone and smiling. He had his phone down so i don’t know if he took a video or picture of me. Then the doctor said Can you please remove your underwear?! I was so nervous and felt anxiety coming in and looked at my bro and dylan who looked really excited. So i took off my underwear and covered myself and the doctor said put your hands on your sides. I could hear my bro and friend giggling but didn’t want to look at them. The doctor then checked everything including my frontal area for 5 minutes and also told me to turn around. Once everything was done and we left the doctors i felt so embarrassed! I didn’t want to talk to anyone. It was nobody’s fault but mine because my mom and the doctor both warned me and i didn’t know what a physical exam is. I can’t blame them. So my mom dropped us off at the basketball game but i really didn’t want to play cause i was having social anxiety and i sat off to the side.

We even have Netflix watch parties where we can talk and watch a movie and even have movie trivia nights with this guy who goes live like twice a week. This has given me something to do and even boasted my confidence as I get new followers and meet some new people. I would recommend finding a hobby and trying to improve on it and maybe even starting something like this where you put yourself out there and see what happens. I know this could be difficult and may even sound stupid but it helped a lot. I’ve also signed up for a summer course, idk if that’s open for you. But it also gave me something to do.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'I\\'m near your age and have had two jobs thus far. My social anxiety is very crippling, but I realize I need money to make my life better in the long run (i.e college funds, rent, etc). So here are some personal tips: nn1. Volunteer. Local pet shelters are great for this as they accept everyone who is willing and not a crazy psycho trying to skin cats. This will introduce you to the social environment of work, and if you volunteer at a pet shelter you will have animals to calm you during the stressful moments. Plus you can literally decide to go whenever you want. For me I go once a week for an hour or two and I even lead shifts now. It helps.nn2. Apply for quiet places. Like a fabrics store or garden center. Something very mello will help your anxiety. My first job was at Walmart in the produce section. The worst you\\'ll have to deal with is someone asking you where the oranges are while standing in front of them. You don\\'t have to work at McDonald\\'s boo, you can be a recluse and water plants for 6 hours a day.nn3. You have phone anxiety like me, so don\\'t pick up! Let them leave a voicemail. I got so many calls when applying for my first jobs and never once answered the first time. They would leave a voicemail and I would promptly call back within 2 hours to a day and give some believable excuse as to why I couldn\\'t answer such as I was in school, on the road, personal issue, bad cell service, etc. They\\'d always be happy to hear back and I would schedule interviews that way. Once you have an interview, save their number and wait for a call back and pick up if you can that time.nn4. Practice practice practice! Write down possible questions and answers to them. Go over them outloud. Take phone calls in a quiet or calm place. Practice common interview questions and prepare to be nervous.nn5. Set your hours low at first and work later or in the mornings. Go for about 18 to 20 a week and work from there. Do NOT, I REPEAT, DON\\'T set hours you\\'ll hate out of desperation that they will only want you if your availability is from 8am to 10pm Monday to Sunday. Also, pick late or early shifts. I.e pick shifts after people go to work for the day to before they get off (9am to 3pm) or after they are usually at home or asleep (9pm to early am for me personally). This is a great time to work at a store like Walmart, Target, etc. The most customers you\\'ll face are nurses or old women who are looking for plants in the meat asile. Get to know your city\\'s schedule and schedule yourself for times when the mass of people are typically busy or elsewhere. 24 hour stores are usually in need of people for these shifts.nn6. Finally, tell them you have anxiety. I have had two jobs, but have been offered over five and have applied to about 15 places. All of which, if I was interviewed, I explained my social anxiety. Employers nowadays are a bit more sensitive to this. You can say \"I have very bad social anxiety, and would prefer doing things mostly in the back or away from people until I am used to the work environment to prevent any problems from arising.\" They\\'ll usually say \"well we will train you to do x thing, but if it takes some time we\\'ll work with you.\" That\\'s when you know they\\'re interested. Don\\'t hide your anxiety to someone who can affect your future employability. My current boss and assistant manager both know how bad I suffer and often coddle me when they see it affecting my work performance. My fellow employees, though I am not friends with them, also understand this and will help me. I work in a pizza place and I take orders on register, give out food, and answer phones. When I need to step away I ask someone to take over and they will. Getting overwhelmed isn\\'t bad, just take a second to step back.nnSome other general tips to remember: Always apply for jobs you\\'ll like FIRST, wait a few days, and then apply for jobs you can deal with theoretically. Try to really go for jobs that match your interests as it\\'ll be easier to adjust to.nnIf you get denied, don\\'t freak. I did this before and it does nothing but take away all your hard work. An interview will happen again.nnI hope I helped.\\')', 'labels': ['not related to an outdoor space', 'related to an outdoor space with positive effect', 'related to an outdoor space with neutral effect', 'related to an outdoor space with negative effect'], 'scores': [0.8165956139564514, 0.07239001244306564, 0.06703890115022659, 0.04397549107670784]}\n",

Ask yourself what your dream job would be. Then do research about what you should be doing to to get closer to having that job. If having a university education improves your chances of fulfilling your dreams, then go for university. Once you have figured whether you want to study or immediately start working, it's time to take the necessary steps to achieve your goal. Research universities you want to apply for, research employers you want to work for. Then rank them according to how attractive they seem, this will significantly reduce anxiety, as even if you don't get your first option you will likely have dozens of good alternatives on your list. You said your grades were good, so someone is very likely to accept you. nnThen try to figure out what each institution/workplace requires from you. Start writing your CV, your letter of motivation or whatever else they might need. You still have until summer before you graduate, and if you spend half an hour per day on these things the time will add up.nnRegarding your social anxiety there are many techniques you can use to reduce or remove it completely, but it does require some work. A good first step is always to ask yourself what gives you the most anxiety. Is it public speaking? Is it conversations? Based on your story it sounds like you have anxiety about meeting new people (a fear I know all too well). The best solution to this is, of course, to keep meeting new people. Find out about social activities you can do in your town or neighbourhood is there a sports-club, movie-club, hiking group, debating society? Another advice is to build a social anxiety ladder, where you will rank your anxieties from least to most anxiety provoking. Then work yourself up this list. Start by exposing yourself to situation that only makes your slightly anxious, once you feel that you can handle these more easily, start on the next item on the list.nnAlso, I need to add that just because you feel anxious around the people in your class doesn't mean that you will feel anxious around other people in the future.

            "{'sequence': \"('My old friends planned a trip and didnt invite me on the same weekend as my birthday. I (23 years old) have some old college friends I still see about every week. For various reasons, a few of those friends, have grown closer to each other, and they are closer to each other than they are to me, although we still go out for drinks, bbq, have movie nights, and have fun every week, or every other week. Their social networks are also much broader than mine, because their careers all require extensive networking. I have also made different groups of friends since college, but not to the same degree as them. I know I feature less prominently in their lives than they do in mine at this point, and it’s not personal. We still have a good time, and just because things change doesn’t invalidate the friendship we do still enjoy. And when it comes to planning any kind of party, they are definitely my favorite friends to go out for a crazy night or a drink with. All of this is fine, until it comes to my birthday. My birthday falls on Labor Day weekend. Last year most of my college friends took advantage of Labor Day weekend to go on a trip to a cabin and have fun together. The person coordinating the event (whose parents own the cabin) obviously chose who would go (only a limited number of people were allowed to come with his parents’ permission). While this same person is a friend of mine, I was not a close enough friend to make the cut to be invited on the trip. Those invited on the trip, however, included most of my friends from college. This forced me to push my birthday party to a different weekend, as I still wanted my old college friends at my birthday party (I didn’t have as many other friends yet that year). But it really made me feel pathetic to plan my birthday around people who had decided I was not important enough to include on a trip the same weekend as my birthday. From what I understand, this same group is going on a trip this Labor Day weekend—once again on my birthday. Obviously a lot of people travel on the 3 day weekend, and I’m not a narcissist who expects no one to travel just cause it’s my birthday. I am also mature enough to not be overly offended if some of my friends plan trips without including me sometimes. But it really hurts me that my college friends all have a yearly tradition to go on a trip I’m not invited on every year the same weekend as my birthday. I know we all are going our separate ways, and I know I am making too much of a deal of my birthday, but birthdays are miserable reminders of life passing by for most people after a certain age, so I feel extra vulnerable around mine, and this is a bit of a punch to the gut for the past 2 years. I don’t want to be childish and tell them not to use the 3 day weekend (that would be dumb and selfish), I don’t want to force myself onto the trip (also dumb and childish), and I don’t want to cut out friendships over something that I don’t think is meant to be personal, when these friendships are mostly rewarding throughout the rest of the year. If someone could gently help me put this into perspective, or how to make me feel less in pain about this. However I celebrate on my birthday, I know I would feel the absence of those friends, and I don’t want to plan some elaborate trip in response—that’s just petty and wouldn’t actually help me stop being petty and hurt over this. I was also thinking about going on a backpacking trip alone so I can get some time to myself, because I don’t like how my relationships with other people are affecting my sense of self worth. That’s not how I want to live my life, and maybe I need to become more independent, and I am tired of having all this stress and pageantry around my birthday. I just know that I will likely be feeling bad because of this on my birthday (I know this is immature, and I need to work past this), and I’m afraid this will be in my thoughts no matter what I do.

            "{'sequence': \"('How I overcame Social Anxiety Disorder. This is my life story focused on how I struggled with SAD and what I did to overcome and cope with this horrible disorder. I hope that others that are suffering with Social Anxiety can not only relate, but can also see a path to success. It started in 4th or 5th grade or so and continued to get at its worst in 6th grade. In 6th grade, I would avoid social situations, I wouldn’t talk to most people around me and I was always known as the “quite kid”. I wouldn’t even talk to my own family.. I completely isolated myself from everyone except a couple of friends that I made in the previous years. But sometimes, I would isolate myself from them as well. I felt different, like everyone else was normal and I wasn’t. I did not understand how to talk to people, how to laugh, how to be around others without being judged. This was an all time low for me. So how did I go from an all time low in 6th grade to overcoming SAD? Well obviously this didn’t happen over night. Lets fast forward to freshman year in high school. At this point, I am not as bad as I was in 6th grade. I was able to make a few friends in middle school around 8th grade, but most of them did not go to my high school, only two of them. But despite having friends, I was still very quite. I kept to myself, constantly just on my phone. At lunch, I really didn’t have anybody to talk to most of the time. And every time somebody tried to talk to me, I just did not know how to communicate with them, I completely shutdown and I was just basically screaming in my head please just go away! So did I ever make any new friends? Not really. I avoided social situations, I kept to myself. Another reason why I did this, is because every time I got nervous taking to someone, my face would get really hot and I turn red very fast, this led me to avoid every single social interaction that I possibly could avoid because of the fear of blushing from how nervous I got. So that’s most of my struggles with this, I need to speed things up because this is turning into a book.. I got a job as a snowboard instructor (still freshman year in high school) and I had to teach groups of kids and sometimes adults how to snowboard. As someone who was very antisocial and a clear case of SAD, this was not easy. But while it was difficult at first, it actually wasn’t that hard. I didn’t need to make small talk with the kids, all I needed to do was to talk about snowboarding and show them how to do it. I had a step by step plan and I knew exactly what I was going to say. This was the first step for me to learn how to communicate with people like a normal human being. I did this for 4 years all through high school. This job helped significantly to force me to stop avoiding situations and to face my fear of social interactions and judgment The next step was college. The first class I took was a communications class, this forced me to speak in front of people every week. This class was proof that even though my speeches sucked, I could stand in front of people and not panic. I proved to my self that despite my SAD, I can do this. This class was truly the pinnacle of overcoming SAD. This class (Mindful Communication) tested how far I have come. I went from complete isolation from people and complete avoidance of all social situations, to standing in front of a college class of 25 people, which were all judging every word I said. I don’t think it’s this class that is what helped me so much.. but it was just the test to show that I can do this. What helped me so much was a combination of things. But I think the biggest help my was my experience as a snowboard instructor. It forced me to communicate with parents, kids, and other snowboard instructors. Putting yourself in the situation that you don’t want to be in is the best way to learn to cope with social anxiety. This is what worked for me, I’m not saying you all need to become snowboard instructors, but find something that will force you to communicate with people that you also enjoy doing. It’s not easy, but this is what it takes. So am I cured? No not completely. But I do not let social Anxiety run my life like it use to. I control my anxiety and I learned to cope with it. I do not avoid social situations like I use to, and I no not get super nervous when talking to people. I have a much better relationship with my family, and I now work as a software developer. I am 23 years old, and I have overcome SAD. I still have some social Anxiety, but it is not a disorder and it’s significantly improved. I hope my story is able to help somebody out there.

I said sure, and walked over. I met like 10 people at the party. They were all really nice and chill, asked about my dog, what I did for work. I had a beer.

            "{'sequence': '(\\' Social Anxiety: The Essentials. After looking around, I felt that sharing my story may help others. And in some way make all the pointless suffering mean something if it helps or resonates with one person. Preface: I am a 24-year-old college grad whos spent countless years languishing in deep thought/fear/pain about their own behaviors and emotions. Probably have had more internal conversations than external ones. Crushed at times under the carousel of depression/self-loathing. Other times crippled so badly by fears of judgments that basic human tasks become sources of complete life-threatening terror. This becomes further compounded when those \"loved ones\" around you gladly and publicly point out your fears as if exposing you will somehow make you stronger. All of this and more! As I share my failures, my victories, and continuous battle with social anxiety. &amp;#x200B; The best way to tell this story is perhaps through pain points of the past, present,(and even future). So I will just dive in no particular order. &amp;#x200B; The Phone Who knew a modern wonder of tech that is supposed to connect us could also be the source of such bone-numbing fear. I think it all started back in 1st grade. A girl gave me her phone number (remember I am like 7). After school I called, and we engaged in the most 7-year-old conversation ever. So basically a conversation about nothing. Afterward, I found out that my Mom and Brother had picked up the downstairs phone and listened to the whole thing. They then for weeks afterward mocked me and repeated what I said on the phone. Talk about traumas to an undefined child. It\\'s events such as those that drive you to form opinions about yourself and make an early association with fear and speaking on the phone. Fast forward and think of all the times (starting from age 7) you have had to speak on the phone. Now imagine each time the thought of using a phone is so horrible it turns your stomach over. Social anxiety in a nutshell. I\\'ve found that with time receiving a phone call was the easier evil. Somehow it being unexpected and someone else initiating the conversation took the edge off it. Having lived into adulthood, phone calls are inevitable so you eventually (through exposure) adapt and develop a tolerance for them. Yet even so to this day placing a phone call to someone is still sometimes a shaky voice and sweaty palm event, particularly when its phone interview. I have one coming up in a few days and dread the idea of literally taking a phone call to be judged by someone. And don\\'t even get me started on making or taking a call in a quiet office space. Advice: Slowly Expose yourself (naturally through time or forcibly by need) to phone interactions. Next time you order food try calling instead of making your mom do it/using an app. Make a doctor\\'s appointment. Usually calling places that handle constant phone calls ( docs/food/customer service) are the easiest to make because you know what you need to say and the person usually is going off a script. It\\'s scary (trust me), but you can work up to it. I avoided using the phone until it became ridiculous for my age and just faced it through trial and error. &amp;#x200B; The Checkout Experience For the LONGEST time growing up this was another point of contact for me and my social anxiety. Having to go alone to a counter and ask/buy something. I really honed my avoidance maneuvers. Giving money to friends to buy my ticket. Walking together up to the counter with someone and throwing my order on theirs so at least I wasn\\'t alone doing it. Or just flat out avoided buying things or asking for help. It\\'s so ingrained in me that I walk into places today and am still so determined to figure out things for myself and not ask employees/help desks for information. Just the thought of having to do it/entering a situation where you know its coming would fill me with red hot anxiety. Like I could run away on the spot. This one really holds you back in life. Today I am more accustomed to it. I worked in retail behind the counter for 4-5 years through college. (that was it\\'s own personal hell). But I kinda reduced the fear a lot over time. I went to go buy a cable recently from an electronic store. I couldn\\'t find it anywhere. Eventually, I approached a worker and said \"Where are the ethernet cables\". He looked so confused and said \"WHAT?\". The worst thing to hear with as someone with anxiety. In a split second you feel nervous, ask yourself \"What did I say wrong? Is this guy going to yell at me?\" Turning inwards and feeling all insecurities explode out into your focus. I said again more loudly \"ETHERNET cables\", and he turned and showed me where they where. Little moments like this, I imagine other people don\\'t remember or acknowledge the way I do. The fact that something so small and unimportant stuck with me for me to be able to write about shows how impactful anxiety is on you. The fixation on past \"failures\" or \"awkward moments\". Yet logic tells me that It\\'s unlikely the worker in that story noticed or cared about my behavior and certainly did not judge me at that moment. If he did, why does it matter so much? These are the sometimes underlying thoughts one must grapple with. The emotions V.S rational thoughts. You feel things that are unpleasant caused by common situations and don\\'t understand/get angry with yourself over those feelings. Then you tell yourself what other people think doesn\\'t matter, then go back to feeling those emotions again. My advice: This one is more tricky because as long as your polite and to the point you can minimize how much you actually have to speak to someone behind the counter. And often if you come into a place prepared you don\\'t have to interact at all (Digital tickets/know where you\\'re going). If this is something you want to overcome, try ordering food in person at McDonald\\'s. (Probably where I first started practicing unknowingly). It\\'s simpler because your just reading from the menu and someone can stand near you if you need it. If you\\'re like me choose one that\\'s not so busy, sometimes the energy of a big crowd can overwhelm your senses. I think remembering the person your speaking to is usually trying to do their job or just answer your question or help you can ease the nerves. &amp;#x200B; The kids \"going through changes\" Not here to repeat any cliches about puberty. Just to note how much more difficult it is to adapt to changes when you\\'re socially anxious. My mom would always say \"you\\'re going through the CHANGE\". I grew leg hair early and it was a lot. It was something my mom especially would comment on. She/ other family would ALWAYS highlight imperfections or changes they noticed on my body. Leg hair, arm hair, acne, height, weight, posture. It\\'s hard enough braving middle school with asshole peers but your own fam making you feel inadequate through teasing is hard. I started just covering everything. Wore long pants all summer, stated avoiding the pool, or exposing too much. Essentially lived like a victorian woman in 1890\\'s. I was so uncomfortable with showing my legs or anything I felt was \"not normal\" I would rather sweat and boil in summer heat then show off my body. This lasted through to high school. Eventually with time It stopped being such a big deal to me. I can only describe it as one day, you wake up, and feel no emotions(or fewer emotions) triggered at the thought of doing the act. So then you just wear shorts. Or show off your body more. Today I am mainly uncomfortable about my weight. I still feel embarrassed about taking my shirt off. I rationally acknowledge that I don\\'t think I\\'m actually as overweight as I think I am and people probably don\\'t see me as fat as I see me. I CAN take my shirt off, but I avoid going to the beach or pools because I compare myself to other more fit people, and feel so unhappy with how I look. This may sound all cliche, but anxiety really takes these things and cranks the dial up to 11. It really impacts your ability to function and changes so much about how you act/what you do/where you go. Advice: This one I\\'m still working on. I think it\\'s an uphill battle (than can be won) if you change how you think. Maturity helps a lot. Getting older and leaving behind all those teenage ideals about judgments. And judging yourself less harshly. I think that\\'s a key to a lot of this. Remember that nobody externally can COME CLOSE to judging as nastily and self-degradingly as yourself. Other people don\\'t experience your day from begging to end. Only you live with all of your memories, behavior, experiences. And therefore the only thing in your control is to slowly change how you react and feel about them. I often say to myself \"be kind to yourself\". It sounds like something you see on a motivational poster in an elementary school hallway. But it\\'s truly worth working on. I think if you stop judging yourself and holding yourself to unrealistic standards of \"perfection\", you can start working on overcoming challenges and having small victories. I saw the path to overcoming anxiety as a straight line with total victory as the goal. But this is not a pass/fail experience! Every phone call, every conversation, I got a little better. You just gotta keep focusing on the victories. (This one sounded preachy but it\\'s my truth.) One thing I heard was this: Imagine your traveling along the same road each day. The road is full of potholes. You keep walking along and without fail always fall into the potholes. For years you keep traveling the same road and keep falling in the potholes. Eventually, your become a little more alert and move out of the way of one pothole. You avoided it. The next day you fall back into the same pothole. This cycle repeats. Yet over time there are changes. Sometimes you avoid potholes. The time it takes for you to pull yourself out of the potholes is shortened. (not doing the analogy justice but you get the point) I felt like this resonated with my life a little. It taught me that overcoming social anxiety is about the progress you make each day and not about achieving some goal of perfection or \"being more normal\". Take a moment and consider how different you are from 1 year ago, and then 5 years ago? I used to be so crippled by anxiety I basically couldn\\'t do anything. Yet somehow I graduated college, survived solo presentation and group projects, worked a retail job, then worked in an office. So if you really want to change, start small and don\\'t give up. The past few days I\\'ve been really anxious and depressed on and off. So it\\'s still something I carry with me. But I\\'m still here pushing and fighting.

            "{'sequence': \"(' I feel like my SA is ruining my life. Hi, I hope this is okay to post. I'm 17F, and I struggle majorly with Social Anxiety along with a mix of Aspergers, depression and extreme highs and lows. I am in desperate need of some advice from someone who doesn't know me. I was intending on posting this in the discord server I made and own for people struggling with mental health but ironically I couldn't get over the fear of people judging me for ranting in my own server (laughing in pain), so here I am. My current situation is that I am a year and two months into an art college course. I have eight months to go to get my diploma. Easy right? I've come this far, I can do the rest. Except, I can't. Every day that I'm there, I sit alone, trying to get my work done but for some reason I feel like absolute shit every second of every day spent there. I can't nearly begin to explain how it feels, the best I can describe it is as a physical heaviness on my chest, different from my normal anxiety. Even just thinking back to the feelings is enough to send me into panic. I mentioned at the beginning of this post that I deal with extreme highs and lows, and what I mean by this is that I have two bigger moods in my daily life, (high and low) and then I have normal mood me which for a while I didn't think existed but following therapy I have discovered that that middle mood is there. When I'm experiencing a high, it's almost as if I switch into a completely different person, like an extrovert. I start cracking jokes in front of people, I participate in all conversations, I feel confident and on top of the world, I feel restless and hyperactive. Having a high is completely random, there's no triggers that I've noticed. I also haven't noticed any triggers for my lows. When I'm low, I feel worthless; sad; emotional; silent; slow; unproductive and I get urges to either SH or kill myself. When I'm out of a low, it's hard to look back and remember in detail what happened, as if it's misted up in my brain like an old memory. When I was younger I was extremely depressed, and I SH and attempted suicide many times, so maybe this is a factor in the sudden urge to harm myself when I'm low as a reaction to negativity? I'm not sure. My 'normal mood' is me feeling calm with not much anxiety and no negative thinking, which to me feels like a happy mood compared to what I experience during a low. Back to my situation - when I'm at college and I experience these lows, there's nothing I can do to handle it, I can't just go to bed and sleep to escape it, or wrap up in a warm blanket and avoid all social interaction. I have to sit in a studio with thirty other people, feeling like that, and often times it leads to meltdowns or panic attacks. I have tried listening to music; fiddling with fidget toys; going for a walk outside; watching netflix; talking to lecturers about it; focusing on work; taking a break from my work and doing different art; drinking water; breathing exercises; sitting in the bathrooms; texting my partner; planning shopping lists. None of these coping mechanisms work. One thing I have noticed is that I either have a low, panic attacks or I get that physical sad heaviness on my chest that feels suffocating every single day at college, which I think has created a fear around attending the course due to having no escape from these emotions and feelings. I've only had a high at college about four or five times. I do remember a time at the beginning of the course where I didn't feel the suffocating heaviness, just the casual anxiety around people. I used to have friends on this course, we were a group of five but this year they've expanded the friendship group, which is all the people on the course. Socialising with four other people was enough for me to come home exhausted and needing to recharge, but I can't handle socialising with a group of 30 odd people. Since then, I've isolated myself from the group - not that the original group have really tried to involve me in the new group. Another thing to add is that I've never been able to maintain a friendship for longer than a year, my boyfriend of almost two years is the longest relationship of any sort I've had. Is this just me, or does anyone else have the same issue? I went on holiday with my boyfriend and parents for three days last week and my god, I felt free. I did feel anxiety and some strong emotions but they felt reasonable because I was in busy environments like a swimming pool or a restaurant. This was great news to me because I thought, hey, this is what life can be like. Then I came home. Hell broke loose within me. I couldn't get myself out of bed to go to college, I haven't been there in almost a week and my attendance is poor enough as it is. I can't work up the energy to shower. I don't feel hungry. I can't even get up to brush my teeth. I don't even want to do art, I've tried, it gives me too much time to think. I've tried sleeping it off, but then the next day comes too quickly and I have to rinse repeat. I'm having about four or five panic attacks a day and a night. I'm keeping my boyfriend awake because we're both scared that I will end up in a mindset where I can't take it anymore and I give up. I can't think about the future without melting down. It's mental and physical hell. I thought it was because of college that I feel this way, that I've had a taste of freedom and I've realised that college isn't it for me. But I'm not sure that's it. I was going to drop out, frustrated and disappointed in myself that I can't make it another eight months to get my art diploma but was confident that I'd be taking a step towards healing my mental health. Then came the bad news, my mum told me that if I drop out then I need to get a job to pay rent because she can't afford to keep me here if she doesn't get government benefits for me. My boyfriend (19M and a full time worker) lives with us, and we're currently sleeping in my parents front room in the side of the house. We've already been told that if we don't move out soon they'll kick us out. We've been looking for places to rent but nobody considers us because we're so young. This has only worsened my anxiety, and I know that I probably seem quite pathetic because I'm scared of working but it isn't just that, I've worked before and I got fired for having panic attacks. It isn't just an unreasonable fear anymore, it's my worst fear at a job come true. So, my choices are: 1. Drop out of college to save my mental health but be forced to find a job and pay rent which will only worsen my mental health anyway, leading me down a path of feeling suicidal for a period of time and then attempting suicide. I've been down that mental path before too many times and I don't want to die so this choice doesn't seem like a good one for me. 2. Continue college for the last eight months, continue feeling this mental hell that I so badly wanted to escape. Get my diploma, be forced to get a job when the course ends anyway. Go back down on the same path of mental health and feeling suicidal. Again, I don't want to die. This is where I'm stuck. Both paths worsen my mental health which I don't want. And I appreciate that not many people enjoy school or working, but to me this isn't just about lack of enjoyment, it's as if there is something in my body that physically stops me from doing it. You know when you have two magnets that are facing the wrong way so you physically cannot connect the two? There's always that distance as you try your best to grip them in your hands and force them together. That's what I experience in my chest, and it's not just an emotion, it's as if there is actually a magnet in my chest. Like, no matter how hard I try to just push through and do these things like jobs or courses, there's a force that won't let me. Believe me, I'm frustrated at myself too for being such a failure. And to address the paths of feeling suicidal, I'm not talking about it like that to be dramatic, I mean it in a way that it's my life pattern and I can't fix it, no matter what I try. My mental health deteriorates, I keep going through it and try my best to get through to the light at the end of the tunnel, but it gets too much, too many lows, too many bad thoughts, too much for me to take. I either take myself to hospital, or I attempt suicide. And it's easy to just say well why don't you push harder, try for longer. I've tried, either way I end up in the hospital waiting room. I've attempted three times this year, the last was this Summer, where I was in the waiting room with my boyfriend from 9:45pm until 11am the next day after being promised a bed on a ward. I was discharged within an hour of being seen. Having been so many times with no help or answers as to why I'm like this, going to hospital isn't an option anymore because obviously there's nothing they can do for me. It hurts so bad that there's nothing I can do to make this better or to make this go away, I don't want to die and leave all my pain to my boyfriend, but I want to not exist anymore, it seems like the only option I have that isn't months and months of torture followed by attempting suicide as a result of it all anyway. My boyfriend is an angel, he didn't sign up for this when he met me and I feel like such a burden on him, but he insists that he'll always be there for me and he compares it to when I was his rock when he was depressed and anxious but he was strong enough to not give up, unlike me. Is this just bad social anxiety? Or is there something wrong with me? Does anyone else feel like this? I hope this made some sort of sense to somebody out there. TLDR; I have two options of continuing college or getting a job, but both feel physically impossible due to anxiety and bad mental health. I fear both paths will lead to me killing myself.
