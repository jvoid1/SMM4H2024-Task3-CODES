I have always felt if I was financially stable, independent form my parents (horrible relationship with dad extreme verbal abuse as a kid, not that good of relationship with family overall, also was teased a lot in school ). And if I was successful ( I have been before, which did wonders for my confidence while in college ) I felt that all my anxiety would just drift away and I would be alright. When I get nervous I start to sweat extremely bad in my face, and its super embarrassing. I know its all physiological and how I view my self, and how I think others are viewing me. When I turned 19 I first tired bettering my self. Started working out, got hobbies,writing,running,reading, (photography) which is my sort of my profession now. Staring to be more serious about life. I had even tried nofap for 2 months. And I wont lie doing all this gave me amazing confidence. I even sating dating a track star at my school! Thing were going great, but still something was amiss. I still had to call mom and dad for cash, still had to listen to there complain about money and fighting with them even through I was off at college. I got the sweats less, but still had them and still got panic attacks around people. Around 22 I ended up trying Xanax for a while which made everything perfect. Then I realized that this quick fix I could not use forever and I gave it up which sucked (withdraw). I really don\\'t want to go back to it. It ended up controlling me I felt I needed all the time to keep up my \"persona\" 2015 has be the worst year of my life After breaking my leg, having my room mate move out (which ruined my credit) on top of that losing a ton of money for medical and surgery and physical therapy(had to sell most all my possessions) , running out of money for college, forcing me to move back with my parents for almost a year now(which as been hell for me been super depressed and such). Almost joining the army to get my life back on track sine that looked like the only window of hope. Then last month ended up winning a photo grant for 10k. Now in 1 in a half months when I get the cash I am going to travel abroad for 4/5 months see the world (got the travel bug last year) and get back to my life and pursuing my passion(writing and photography) and after my trip moving to LA with one of my best friends. Also back in school online atm till I move back to California to finish my degree. So ya things are looking really good right now! I really think getting my life back on track will cure my anxiety( this will be the fist time in my life I am a 100% independent, For some reason I feel like this is it. I will be cured ). Always when I gained something, (success,confidence,hobbies, sense of focus) my anxiety got less. Am I being to hopeful ?

            "{'sequence': \"('You are not your inner critic.. Hey everyone. I wrote this a while ago to cope with some real life issues and stumbled upon it recently. I thought this sub might like it. There is an inner critic behind each thought and each word typed out in front of me. None of my writing has to make any sense to anyone but me, but it’s as if it’s in my nature to have it make sense for others as well. Words are just used to express feelings and thoughts that I have in order to relate to another individual with similar experiences. And so other people also have thoughts and feelings that they try to convey through their words, but I wonder how often those thoughts and feelings get mixed up or portrayed inaccurately when they’re trying to convey something. Maybe we all have difficulties expressing who we really are deep down. Our inner most self is rarely seen by others. If we can pull down the curtain for others to see our true self we will not hesitate to do it. There must be some circumstances in place to do so. First off you must trust in that other individual completely. If you can’t open yourself up to another person’s opinions then you will not be able to convey your inner most self to others. You must trust that you can handle whatever another person throws at you. Other people are unpredictable and that’s flawed… Other people are good deep down, but their thoughts and feelings can also be misconstrued like ours. We see the thoughts behind our actions, but rarely do we see others for their thoughts. Their actions are much more easily seen. Their actions are instantly seen and judged rather than pondered like they should be. Everyone is trying to deal with their own demons and we are no different. The struggles of humanity come from the same seed of despair. We are all struggling with the purpose of our existence. Some seek refuge in faith, while others escape to different worlds through books or video games. There are no surefire ways to live our lives in this world. We are all given this opportunity through the sheer coincidence that the universe has created for us. There is no tangible thing that will bring us the peace that we seek. That peace can be found within ourselves and through the bonds that we forge as we live on. The people around us are also suffering, so we might as well take solace in the idea that we are not alone in our suffering. Our scars may look different on the outside, but they all harbor the same feelings of sadness and despair. These feelings pave way to the love that exists only when we’re vulnerable with one another. It’s no secret that we won’t be on this earth forever. Why waste time judging others for their misdeeds or interests when you could be enjoying life? It’s a pity, really. We’re all so engrossed in ourselves that we rarely see others for who they really are. They’re all like me. They all have loved ones. They all would love to make a friend who they can spend time with. They all want something to believe in. As I’m typing this, other people are also living their lives in their own worlds. My world may be different from theirs, but each world is valid in its own right. I don’t need to fear the criticism of other people. That brain power can be spent on solving my problems, rather than exacerbating them. The biggest hurdle in my 20 years of being on this earth so far is challenging that inner critic that tells me what I should be. It tells me what I shouldn’t do more often than not. It tells me I’m not good enough to stand amongst my peers and be myself. That inner critic is as real as me, but it doesn’t have to be if I loosen its grip on me. When I run that inner critic comes out and realizes it has no power. It keeps saying “I can’t do it. I should just give up. I don’t like this pain.” After a while that voice realizes the futility in its words. Overcoming that voice in one area of life shows just how it can be achieved in all other areas. Persistent effort is the key to any positive change. It takes more than a few words of encouragement to get past this inner critic. It takes determination and it takes time. Nothing happens instantly. No real change can be done in a day. Habits form and within those habits are the key to a good life.')\", 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with positive effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect', 'outdoor activity or space with negative effect'], 'scores': [0.3661356270313263, 0.3269011974334717, 0.30696311593055725]}\n",

For example, I was having trouble understanding a concept for a quiz that I had last week, so i said, \"Fuck it\", and went to school early to study in the library and maybe ask for help. As I went to the library I saw a group of my classmates studying together for the exam. At first I was hesitant of approaching and asking for help, but I forced myself to do so because I realized that the pros of understanding the class material and challenging my social anxiety were greater than the cons of avoidance and not knowing anything on the quiz.

            "{'sequence': \"('Reducing your Social Anxiety. I wanted to put this together to help as many people as possible that are trying to function with social anxiety, which as you already know, can be extremely hard. I also want to say that in no way, shape, or form have I defeated social anxiety. These are tips, advice, and helpful things that can and will improve your quality of life and diminish your social anxiety. Most of this comes from my own experiences and also from what people have said about their own experiences in reducing/overcoming social anxiety. These will not only improve your anxiety but also your life in general. Stop masturbating and stop watching porn(if you do): A big reason for a lot of people's social anxiety is masturbation and porn. I won't get into the specifics too much but a orgasm from porn triggers a neurotransmitter to go off in your brain in a very large amount called dopamine. Such a large amount and especially at a high rate(if you orgasm to porn a lot) can cause anxiety, depression, among other things. Stopping this alone can do so many things. Able to talk to girls better, more energy, and being relaxed in social situations are all benefits of stopping this. Also if you are addicted to porn and masturbation(which might be you) this may be harder then usual. For most people that are addicted, full benefits are usually seen about 90-110 days after stopping. This is the time is takes to rewire your brain. Also the time may vary depending on the severity of your addiction. Healthy diet: Stay away from sugars. To be a healthy person, doctors say we should only have 37g of sugars a day. To put that in perspective a regular pack of skittles has 46g of sugar. An excess amount of sugar also triggers the dopamine transmitter which as you know, can do bad things. Stay away from sugar as much as possible. It is not good for you in any way. Try going after healthier things which can have great effect on your mood and anxiety. Cold showers: Not only do cold showers build willpower, they also are proven to decrease depression and build testosterone, which can help your anxiety tons. Cold showers are also very refreshing and can provide you with much more energy. The next chance you get, take a cold shower(not a cool shower) and see how you feel afterwards. I honestly didn't know what to expect but when getting up for school or work, they can take the grogginess away and you'll feel much more capable of tackling the challenges the day presents. Limiting time spent on phone/TV: So much of us with social anxiety get caught into this lifestyle where we're always on our phones, games, TV. Don't get trapped into this lifestyle. Do activities and build hobbies that you will enjoy. Start reading a novel. Start playing a sport. Do something other then coming home from work or school everyday and going straight to the TV. Exposure to social interactions: Some of us hide away or avoid social interactions or things that give us anxiety. One of the best ways to become more comfortable and relaxed when in these social situations that you dread is by doing them. Build your confidence and experience in these situations. Greater anxiety in the present is less anxiety in the future. I'll tell you how I am currently doing some of these things. 1. My job: I got a job at Monkey Joes. If you don't know what that is, it's a inflatable place where kids and families can come to jump around and have birthday parties/gatherings. Part of my job is hosting parties. Which means in front of 16-60 people I have to host a party. Also this party is in somewhat a enclosed room where most of the time people are standing/sitting right next to eachother. I have to give out orders, make sure the mom and dad of the birthday boy/girl are satisfied, help with anything that needs to be done. Also I have to speak in front of all these people and let them know what to do. My first party, I was terrified. I've now down about 5-6 and guys, I can't even put into words the difference this has already had on me. This helped me in so many ways like being in big groups, walking into places(like classrooms) with a lot of people and so forth. It's amazing the difference something can make when all you have to do is just simply apply yourself. School: As much as I can, I try to ask questions, and start conversations. I've made so many friends this year that I wouldn't have imagined making a year ago. Try to ask questions and talk to people your interested in talking too. Join a Toastmasters club(when you are ready): A toastmasters club is a group of people who meet up and give speeches to each other to better their skills at public speaking. This is a great way to challenge yourself and anxiety. It's also a great way to become a better public speaker which is a good skill to have. Running/working out: Not only does this get you in better shape but running or working out can build testosterone and also release a lot of built up anxiety. As you know, testosterone is good for people with anxiety. It can build confidence. If I've had a stressful day or have a lot of anxiety, I'll go on a 30min-hour jog with music and feel tons better afterwards. Drugs: Stop smoking weed: I used to smoke weed a lot. I think it actually had to do something with causing my social anxiety. I stopped smoking weed and felt loads better in the future. THC is linked to causing social anxiety so watch out for that. Not only did this help my anxiety but I was also able to focus on my school and sports much more. My focus in the classroom was also improved. Meditation: I, personally, have not tried meditation before. As you've probably heard though, it can do some pretty good things. People have said it's worked wonders in their life. Look up good techniques and try them. Also, if you do meditate, feel free to comment on your techniques and some benefits meditation has. Be prepared: When in school, knowing what the class is about or what the discussion is about gives me way more confidence then if I don't know what anything is about and I'm clueless. I've found that when I'm actively doing my homework, studying for tests, and maintaining a high grade, I have less anxiety/more confidence in the class and also around my peers. Don't just do the work or get by with a D. Become actively engaged in what's being taught and you will find yourself very intrigued and applying yourself more. Limit Stress: Sometimes, life is very overwhelming. Try to get things done beforehand and create a schedule of events/things that need to be done. You already have anxiety as it is, don't stress yourself out even more with things that need to be done. Get things done ahead of time to where you feel you have an adequate amount of time to yourself. Respect yourself and value yourself. Don't cheat yourself by letting deadlines go back and slipping up on due dates. Your only digging a deeper hole for yourself.

Hello, I just joined this sub Reddit and created this account just for the sake of getting my social life back in control. Before i go any further i would love to talk about where i was 4 years ago. Since i was a kid i always wondered why i am I so weird. Why can't i do social stuff like everyone else, why am I always scared, why do i stutter when i have attention of a group of people. These questions always were in my head until when day i found out about social anxiety and finally i was like i have the answer. Now i can look for a solution to treat my social anxiety. I think i was like 16 when i found out about social anxiety, although i was in India at that time so didn't had much support for it plus basic teenage stuff was going on in life. Getting bullied, being ashamed of being skinny which hurt my self esteem really bad, not being able to express my feeling to the girl i liked. All of this made my anxiety worse and i started to avoid people. Move forward to the age of 19 i come to new York, i feel now my life is gonna change. Somehow magically being in new York will turn me into some confident social bird. But i was wrong, i started college and things aren't changing i am still anxious around people have low self esteem, don't have a gf, skinny sf plus i am developing depression now. On top of that my mindset is changing into a mindset of a victim, i always feel like i am being attacked by people. This goes on for few more years and somehow i survive. Now I am 21, fucked up. Social anxiety is so bad that i can't even get out of house. I fucked up my semester in college and gpa is all fucked up. All i do is play league of legends whole day and i am only eating like one meal a day. Plus i am broke af don't even have money for food. I had it enough i said i have to change myself and will have to take control over my life. I had this burning feeling inside my body which i couldn't get rid of. So i started to taking, i did the following: 1. For first month i practiced getting out of house. I would go carts thinking about how do i get out of house. But i committed to it sometimes i would just walk outside for a minute and comeback. 2. Second month started to take walk outside house. My goal was to take walk a in places with lots of people, which is easy to do since i live in nyc. While walking my goal was to observe my anxious thoughts and try not to react to it. I read this book called power of now, where i learned about this concept of observing your thoughts. 3. Next I got a job as a salesperson. Holy shit that was a nightmare i have no idea how i even survived that, it was just crazy i wasn't event able to talk yo customers. I wanted to avoid that but i had no choice. 4. In college my goal was to ask questions in class. It was awkward though but i had made up my mind. I am not going to live like this, i have to beat this social anxiety. Now fast forward to 2017, one of my best years in life man. 1.I crushed it this year, i started my ecommerce business for which i worked my ass off and now i am making decent money. I am also about to launch my own social media agency. Plus i am part to so many entrepreneurial communities on social media. 2. Last semester i had one class where i would i was the most social person. Everyone knew me, i would make jokes and stuff. 3. I joined gym and went from 115lb skinny dude to 140 lb guy although i haven't been going regularly to gym recently. 4. Went to tony Robbins event unleash the power within! It was really crazy crazy. I am really into self development and tony is one my favorite person i look upto. 5. I went on a trip. 6. I tried to pickup girls, lol. It's fun but it's scary at times. And more stuff which will only make this post longer. How did i do it? I really believe that what we focus on is what we become. So my whole life i focused on social anxiety but in last few years i have changed my focus from anxiety, depression to the person i want to become. I try to focus more on what my goal is and how can i achieve it. Also i feel you have to have a sense of like enough is enough. Frustration and anger have always been my fuel, they give me so much energy to push myself further and further. Do i get anxiety? Yes feel it everyday it's just matter of taking control over it. Decide if you want to give in to anxiety or you want to win over it. Also i recently read something cool about anxiety, instead of trying to call yourself being anxious call yourself as being excited as anxiety and excitement are similar emotions. So by doing this whole meaning changes. Although i haven't been doing things i used to do and getting kind of comfortable. Recently i started to stutter when asking questions in front of big group so i have start working on social skills again. Ask me anything guys. You want to message, do that. I will do anything to help you need any advice. I am here to grow and help others grow.

            "{'sequence': \"('How I Got Rid of my Social Anxiety (Not a Panacea, but things that helped me). First of all, I know this post is long, bear with me. I’m writing this post to be the message I wish I could’ve read 2 years ago. If I had understood then what I understand now, I could’ve saved myself so much pain, embarrassment, and loneliness. I hope his helps someone out there. Even if your experience is somewhat different, I guarantee there is something in what I’ve been through that might help make sense of it all. **TLDR**: I went from fully socially comfortable, surrounded by friends, outgoing and friendly, to depressed, thinking anxious thoughts all time, desperately uncomfortable around other people. At that point, I did everything I could to figure out what went wrong, and how I could fix this terrible problem. The two main factors in the development of my social anxiety were an addiction to my phone/computer/Netflix/Reddit/Youtube, and increasing isolation from other people. **How my Social Anxiety Developed** A little background about my life. When I was young, basically up until high school, I never had a problem with anxiety. I spent tons of time with my friends, perfectly fine social skills, played sports, no problems with depression or anything like that. I’m 22 years old now, just finished four years of college. I think kids growing up today are dealt a much harder hand than I had. Internet addiction and compulsive smartphone usage played a huge role in my becoming isolated, anxious and depressed, and I imagine there are lots of kids out there who are maybe going through something similar, but without the foundation of a normal social childhood/early years. I started to develop anxiety around other people in high school. I had friends in school, through classes and sports, but didn’t spend much time with them outside of school. At the end of the day I would usually go home and spend time on Reddit, Youtube, Netflix or watch pirated movies and TV shows. My family had some serious problems, so I didn’t like to spend time with them. I would just go into my room alone, and try and take my mind off my problems with entertainment. My family was pretty poor, so I’d be hungry often, not have a lot of energy, and just want to unwind in bed with my laptop. I spent a lot of time doing that, especially over the summers. I went off to college and everything turned around for me. I was lucky enough to live in a college dorm with some great, kind, wonderful people, and I became good friends with many of them. I made an active effort to spend time with my friends, and I had social interaction every day. It became so easy for me to spend time with people. I was the happiest I’d ever been, and figured I’d grown from my awkward high school days and I was cured. I didn’t realize it could ever be like that again. My senior year things became worse for me than they’d ever been. I’m not proud of how I responded to a difficult year, but I honestly did not understand what was wrong with me, or how to fix it. I was swamped with difficult classes on top of working 20hrs a week at a job I hated. I had a bad habit of procrastinating until the last minute, and it caught up with me. I became constantly sleep deprived, was close to broke all the time so I started barely eating, just trying to will my way through the work I had to get done. I started finding it incredibly difficult to focus on reading technical research articles, having to go back and reread paragraphs over and over again. I became terribly uncomfortable just answering questions in class. When I started missing assignments and classes, I avoided my friends so I wouldn’t have to explain. My mind started to become uncomfortable, even alone. I numbed the pain and constant anxiety by going on reddit, youtube, Netflix, mindlessly browsing looking for something to make me smile or laugh, just something bright in what became a daily experience of feeling depressed, sad, anxious, all the time. I would be on my phone or listening to music almost constantly. I would constantly be thinking about how I was missing work, letting down my family and friends. I didn’t want to open up to anyone. I was incredibly ashamed. I ended up failing two classes, attended my graduation since grades weren’t out yet, and just lied to family and friends. I told no one that I had failed, just held it inside. I moved back home with my parents, took an easy job where I figured I could take time to figure out what went wrong, and go back to finish my degree after a semester or two off. It’s been just about a year now since I failed, and I’m going back in the fall to finish. **Symptoms of Social Anxiety, How it Played Out in my Life** Once I moved back home, I took a job where I had infrequent social interaction, and I spent very little time with my family. Problems with social anxiety became worse than they had ever been. I would feel anxious when people walked up to me, I would feel anxious just doing something as simple as ordering coffee or walking through a grocery store. In conversations, I would try to make normal, comfortable eye contact, but lose track of what the other person was saying because my attention was on eye contact. I almost definitely came across as dumb or unfriendly. And that’s not me being too harsh on myself; I’ve spent most of my life friendly and pleasant to be around, I understand how I was coming across, I just couldn’t figure out how to be socially comfortable again. I was literally losing track of simple conversations, or my responses would become simple and short. This was very embarrassing for me. I became uncomfortable just being with other people, so I isolated myself more. Every day just kind of sucked, I was always worrying about how I came across to others, always worried in general. I became very depressed and lonely. Started smoking weed frequently, playing video games, watching movies, just looking for something good after a day of awkward interactions, of being judged, of feeling alone. Almost all of my friends from college lived far away, so I saw them very infrequently. **How I Got Rid of the Anxiety, Became Socially Comfortable Again** A big part of trying to get better was keeping track of how I was spending my time. I started writing an hour-by-hour log every day of what I was doing. Then at the end of the week, I’d review how the week had been, what areas I needed to focus on, what mistakes I kept making. At the end of the month, I’d do the same process. I started bringing a small notebook with me everywhere I went, and took down quick notes on any ideas or experiences that I wanted to be sure to remember later. I wrote in a journal, infrequently at first, then more regularly. I recommend doing something to keep track of life, it makes it easier to identify trends and progress. I stopped compulsively using my phone, and I cut back the time I was spending online, on reddit, watching youtube. All the time I would spend flicking my attention from link to link on reddit, always taking in content, never producing my own thoughts, was hurting my attention span. I found it harder to become engrossed in books and long form content than it was when I was younger. This was a real problem for me my senior year, and I am sure that my constant use of reddit and social media was a factor in my difficulty concentrating and getting work done. All that time on the internet was hurting my attention and putting my mind in an anxious state of staccato, quick thoughts. I am 100% sure that my overuse of the internet, reddit and youtube in particular, was having an adverse affect on my mind. It was taking the place of the natural human state of mind; longform, uninterrupted production and operation of thought. I started a habit of meditation every day. Essentially you sit quietly, and pay attention to sensations, emotions, and thoughts as they arise. I can’t overstate how important this has been to me. It is a peaceful 10 minutes at the start of the day, where I can relax, don’t have to worry about all the real problems that follow me around all day, and begin to understand the operation of my mind. I use the Waking Up app, highly recommend it, it is exceptionally well made. If you can’t afford the monthly subscription, like me, the creator Sam Harris offers a free yearly subscription, you just have to email the address in the app description, no questions asked. I started spending more time with people who I loved, who wouldn’t judge me. This is the most important part. I was always anxious to talk with people, because I wasn’t doing it very often. And when I did talk to people at work, they were strangers who didn’t know me, so if I came off as shifty or nervous they would pick up on that, and the interaction was often uncomfortable. My mind would then associate interaction with that unpleasant experience of being judged, of making people uncomfortable. Some of my good friends lived an hour or so away, but I knew I needed more social interaction, so I made the drive, over and over. After I spent an hour or so with my good friends, I started to feel relaxed, and was more able to get into the conversations, without thinking about eye contact, being self conscious about everything I said, etc. The key to feeling like my old social self was in large part this right here. SPEND MORE TIME WITH FRIENDS. I was lucky in that I had friends out there who loved me. I know some people don’t have anyone, and when you are awkward and anxious it is very hard to make those connections. Don’t give up. I started stretching and exercising every day. For me, anxiety and depression went hand in hand, and moving my body everyday had a huge impact on my depression. Obviously exercise alone won’t fix all your problems. For more information on depression I recommend the book “Lost Connections” by Johann Hari. It helped me a ton. Or for a quick runthrough of the book, listen to his interview on Joe Rogan or Sam Harris’ podcast. Exercise and stretching (look up beginner yoga routines on youtube to follow along with) helped me correct my posture. After going through four intense years of study, often sitting hunched over a desk, or looking down at my phone, or just lounging on the couch, living a sedentary lifestyle in general, my posture was becoming a serious problem. Mind and Body are fundamentally linked, so if you want to feel comfortable in mind, it helps to feel comfortable in your body. Start off slow if you need to, go for a short walk at least. Even on my worst days, getting out of the house and walking the dog helped a little. I started eating more healthy food. I switched to a regular diet of mostly eggs, meat, fish, vegetables, fruit. I figured stick to the foods that our species has evolved to consume. I’m not a nutrition expert, but eating like that, and getting enough to eat, meant I had a stable baseline of energy throughout the day, instead of being tired all the time. **Tips for Social Interaction** When I started spending more time with people, I was very rusty. I felt as if I had forgotten a bunch of the fundamentals. Here are a few things I find helpful to keep in mind. Eye Contact. I made so many mistakes when I was trying to get back to my normal social self, particularly around eye contact. Our species has evolved to convey and understand information through facial expressions and where we look. So it is important. Where you look says a lot. In general, when someone is talking to you, by looking at them you give the message “I am listening to you, I’m interested in what you’re saying, you are heard.” One mistake I was making was I would think “alright, be friendly, make eye contact”. But I would be so uncomfortable and unused to the experience, I would think about it too much, I would focus intensely on the eyes, and would be so focused on eye contact I wouldn’t even process what they said. So I’d give off a message that’s very off, too intense, and if I wasn’t listening to what was said I had to look away and kind of process after the fact. You basically want to get to a point where you aren’t thinking about eye contact. That’s only going to come from repeatedly going into social interactions, and eventually getting to aplace where it doesn’t make you uncomfortable, and you can just use your eyes to convey meaning. As a general rule, try and be relaxed, be friendly, and look at the person that’s talking to you. You don’t have to stare them down, just relax your gaze so you’re not pinpoint focused on only the eyes. You want your attention fully on what the person is saying to you, not on eye contact. You don’t have to force eye contact. If you aren’t too comfortable with it, that’s alright. As long as you pay full attention to what’s being said, you’re alright. If you come off a little shy because you’re not making a lot of eye contact, that’s ok. It gets easier the more time you spend with people. For an idea of where people generally look while in conversation, watch a youtube video of an interview with someone you respect or admire, and see what they do. Or just pay attention to how the people around you make eye contact. People tend to comfortably look at the other person while listening, and while speaking people tend to look away often while thinking, kind of checking in with their eyes every once in a while. There’s not one right way to do it, just do what is comfortable and effective for you. What to say. A lot of my anxiety around being with people was from not having much to talk about. Part of that was I was wasting so much time online, I really didn’t have many interests or recent experiences that were engaging to discuss. In any case, it’s always a good idea to try and talk in terms of the other person’s interests, if you want them to be engaged in the conversation. When you are just getting to know someone, ask questions about their life that you are curious about. Again, the more you do it the easier it gets. Ask about their life, what they do, what they like, what they dislike. Try and find out what they are really interested and passionate about. For example, if they keep bringing up Basketball, take note of that. Ask about their favorite team, did they play the sport in high school, whatever comes to mind. Or talk about whatever’s in the environment, or coming up at work or school.

I just really need to vent this, my head is about to EXPLODE full of stress, but i just look at things and I worry why i cant be normal and cant dig myself out of loneliness. Just a heads up, its gonna be a long one if you are on mobile.  and#x200B; I wanna give some background, I live in the UK, sometimes I feel like this place is alien to me, even though for the 18 years ive been on this earth, ive lived here. I felt like i've never truly fitted with people, i dont think i'm an odd person, just my mental health is so poor, its comes off like that. Parents always called me a shy kid (I was quieter but i think i'm naturally a more chill person), I don't think that really helped my situation, because i wasn't suffering from it then, I remember still being able to be normal in public up until around the age of 13. I have faced a lot of bullying in my life, sometimes from my own family without them knowing it,up until the age of 16, maybe not to the extent of what other people have faced, but it seemed to affect me a lot more. I will say that anxiety does run in my family, so i believe it is partially down to genetics.  and#x200B; Right, I wanna cut deep into the bullying, I wanna start with my family, obviously i know families have a bit of it, its just natural, but I feel like they instilled fear into me for stuff that did not need it. For example, i still get anxiety from listening to certain types of music in my house incase someone hears it and says something about it, i remember one time, when i had my first phone (i had one before but my parents kept taking it off of me), there were music ringtones on there, i couldnt possibly remove them, they were system locked, my dad finds them one day on my phone, plays them and everyone in the house laughs at me. Or another example, which has hit me the hardest of them all, Social Media, they scared me into not getting, made me fear it cus i was too young for it, I might agree, but they made me avoid it like the plague, until 16, when I got facebook and Instagram finally (I had twitter at 13, buts its not really that kind of place, but I still cant bring myself to add my family on there let alone most people I know. In other forms of bullying, When i say i am not an odd person, well I definitely used to be, up until i started college, i was very weird, and was bullied to death in school, people would play 'punchies' on me just for fun, and well, me being a skinny kid, I couldnt really fight back with conviction. I admit, im an emotional guy, and that i ruined a lot of friendships for me, cus if one thing went wrong, id storm off, at least these days im able to battle off that emotion. I was made fun out of in every single way possible, and its beaten every single last ounce of confidence and self esteem I have had.  and#x200B; To put this into perspective, this is how bad my problems go to; I cant go outside without feeling a strong urge of anxiety, I cant add anyone on social media, even if I know them cus I dont trust anyone and im afraid they will also reject me, they have to add me, which of course, no one will because no one cares (honestly, i feel like i just really hate my area), so ive ended up with only like 30 friends on facebook, similar number on insta, I do have snap, but i think you dont really gotta add everyone on there, since its more of a private place. I feel really incompetent at doing anything by myself, i feel like i have to do stuff for a strong reason otherwise i flake. My anxiety out in public goes near panic attack levels, I wouldn't say i go to that, but I sometimes ill get a dry mouth and body just doesnt want to deal with the pressure, I also cant move my body normal unless i'm confident, which is a more weird quirk thats been given to me by social anxiety. I never had a girlfriend, never even had a first kiss, never even attempted to really chat up a girl, i feel like im gonna end up as one of those people who is in his mid 20s, and still in that situation. I dont even like people looking at my phone, I refuse to pull it out on public transport unless its pretty empty.  and#x200B; I feel so isolated all the time, my phone is constantly dry, I have tried some positive things, like meeting people online in various ways, a lot of those people I really like too. I've really tried to keep positive this week, but today its just went haywire, i woke up with a real big feeling of loneliness, i just felt the need to cry, I didn't know why, and now its just making me think about stuff too deeply.')\", 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with negative effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect', 'outdoor activity or space with positive effect'], 'scores': [0.39035293459892273, 0.3711550533771515, 0.23849201202392578]}\n",

I'm not meaning to, I really try to be nice to people but I think my expressions and tone don't match my intentions because people close to me say I look and sound angry and mean.

Taking a walk is a great way, you can start in a residential place with less people and then move on to place with more and more. Going to movie theaters, fast-food, restaurants, conventions, also helped me.

It seems to me that you relied on him too much (I hope this does not sound harsh; totally not my intention), and now don\\'t know what to do. Remember that relationships are not a MUST. Don\\'t feel like you need someone, or need to be with someone. Instead, for now try to work on your emotional state and stability. Join a yoga class, start running, anything to let out some of the pent up anxiety and frustration. Painting is a beautiful way (I find) to express your emotions.

So I did nothing. Then during my last year of school due to the lack of any social life and stuff I decided I had to do at least something meaningful in my life (playing games, programming and watching minute physics all day didn\\'t satisfy anymore, it didn\\'t serve any purpose). Then I started running, every day in the evening though the fields, where no one could see and bother me. I think I started with 1km, really slow, and I truly hate running. And i was really bad at it. But at least at the end of the Day I had the feeling that I\\'d done at least one thing that served a purpose on that day. I got better at it, started running longer rounds and faster, I used one of these running tracking apps, they motivate A LOT! Even started to enjoy it sometimes a bit. At the same time I started running I cut back my food intake (in retrospective I ate way too less then I should have). Both these things where just hard on a physical level - I was a) hungry and b) running is hard work. BUT you\\'re not working against your fears in that case, so it\\'s doable!

I can say it is not as severe as having to drop out of school but it was pretty close to it. A few things I can tell you: 1) Mindfulness. Something I SHOULD practice more of.. but mindfulness is a form of meditation to help bring your mind out of the constant state of thinking (i.e. about if others are judging me) and brings you to a complete focused state. Look up mindfulness audio sessions or something like that on google, there is plenty of tutorials and things to help. 2) \"Don\\'t break the chain\" ..its something the famous comedian Jerry Sienfeld talked about. This is a comedian who has done so many stand up routines that it seemed so unlikely he was able to write that many jokes! How does he do so many one hour specials?! He mentioned it was something he calls \"dont break the chain,\" or in other words he would write a joke every single day, good or not, but do so EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. The reason I say this is because you should find something to work on every single day, no matter what! I myself joined a gym about a year and a half ago.. it was not because I wanted to lose weight (though that was on my mind as well) but because I needed some constant factor in my life that I would put forth effort each day to complete, something I HAD to do, to keep my mind on it.. You should find something to do, even if it\\'s just drawing a small picture or running a mile.. do it EVERY DAY! And if for whatever reason you can\\'t.. just do it the next day! In all of my years in dealing with social anxiety (and a negative family putting me down) I realize that the anxiety stems mostly from overthinking. Is that person looking at me from their car as I walk down the street? Am I worthless because I don\\'t have a job? Is what I\\'m wearing okay? etc. the list is endless. For me, social anxiety has stopped me from my potential being fully realized. It has stopped me from having a healthy relationship with pretty much any woman. It has stopped me from going out on the few beautiful days I see here.. I still have it, but not as bad. I practice a few things every day and you eventually reach a point of self confidence. You will know when you start to get comfortable with yourself and you start having thoughts like \"who gives a shit what they think! This is what I\\'M doing for me!\" One last note: I currently live in an area where cannabis is legal for recreational use. I started smoking not for my social anxiety itself but the fact that many other people here seemed to do it. I started smoking to make friends but now I keep smoking because it does make me feel good and content with the world around me.

I’ve always knew that I was insecure. Ever since I was a kid, I had problems with certain body parts that I deemed as “imperfect.” But, it got worse over the years. When I turned 9, I started covering my face with my hair because I felt better if I wasn’t exposing too much of my face When I was 10, I started developing social anxiety and started wearing baggier clothing, I also started looking in the mirror for hours a day. When I turned 11, I started covering my face more than ever before, I’d only wear certain types of clothing that I thought were “less revealing,” my anxiety started to become worse than it’d ever been before and got pulled out of school for it. When I was 12, I started noticing changes in my appearance from hour to hour, or day to day, these changes were usually in my face. Everyday, I’d wake up and think to myself, “okay, am I gonna be pretty or ugly today?” I don’t really know what the real me looks like anymore, sometimes I barley recognize my own reflection. Sometimes I stare in the mirror for hours a day, just pointing out flaws or changes. Sometimes I avoid looking in the mirror all together. Most of the time I don’t even see myself as a human, or too ugly to even be a human. I’ve had thoughts of performing surgery on myself and imagining how perfect I’d be if I done it, but I try not to think about it. Everyday, I watch videos about plastic surgery. Somehow, I feel like all of my problems would be gone if I just changed some of my facial features, like I’d be able to live an actual life. I’d pay any price for it, I don’t care if it could kill me, I’d do it. When I used to go to school, I’d carry out certain ways of getting ready. I’d mainly go to school on days where I felt like I looked like an actual human, most of the times I’d just cry in front of a mirror saying to myself “you’re disgusting.” It’s gotten easier since I’ve stopped going to school, but it still bothers me a lot. Minor inconveniences like catching a person staring at me, or wind blowing in my face and blowing my hair away from it would ruin my day. At lunch and break, I’d sit in a bathroom stall looking at my face, most of the time, I’d look at it and wouldn’t wanna come out, then have to get sent home by teachers because I was too afraid to go into class. I’ve always held back from talking to people about how ugly I feel, especially my parents and doctors. My next appointment is next week, I’ve never talked to any of my doctors about me feeling disgusting, I’ve always just told them that I only feel anxious for no real reason. I think I might tell my doctor this week, maybe then I’ll actually begin to get better. I think most of the anxiety comes from me feeling incredibly ugly, so I think it’s best to work on that. Body dysmorphia is also a thing that people with social anxiety are more likely to have, so I guess it’s safe to say that it’s a possibility. I’m excited to talk to my doctor about this, because I feel like it might be the start of me actually beginning to feel happier again. I just don’t know if I should tell him about the wanting to perform surgery on myself, because he might see that as me having thoughts of self-harm.

Once you feel comfortable enough (It will never be comfortable but it will feel better) then you call them. You ask to set up and appointment and you show up at that appointment. Don't give up if the first place you call can't see you. Keep trying. Then you keep seeing them. Do your best to be as open and honest as possible and actually try the things they suggest you do no matter how stupid or or useless they seem. These are trained professionals, not someone looking to make you into a fool. With some time you will start feeling more stable. Not better, but stable. Then you start trying to work on finding something you enjoy. Games, movies, music, dogs, reading, helping old ladies cross the street. It really doesnt matter what it is. Just find something that sucks less than the other things and keep doing it. Try and see if there is a way to help the social anxiety while doing that. If you like dogs, go to a dog park or a regular park and ask to pet someones dog. If its movies maybe try to go to a movie store or something and buy/rent/look at a movie. If its music go to a record store and look at what they have. Just something you can do that adds a social element to whatever it is you find you like. And keep pushing that boundary. Hows your hygiene? If you arent showering at least every other day. Start. There is literally not a single excuse for not doing it.

Try and find something that is more enjoyable than other things. Something to look forward to doing and just enjoy it and once you are into it more, try and incorporate social aspects into it. 3.

In middle school was my first relationship with this girl named C. It started when I asked her to a dance (which was extremely nerve racking), and that was before my SA got too bad. It was a pretty standard relationship. We held hands and hung out. Then we broke up like 2 weeks later. Then at the end of 9th grade I started dating a girl named M. We kinda dropped hints that we liked each other but never did anything about it. A few weeks into summer I mustered up the courage and sent her a long heartfelt text about how I really liked her and whatnot. I wasn\\'t really asking her out, but just making my feelings clear. Then like a week later she asked me out and I said yes. I think we hung out once during our relationship then she dumped me about 2 weeks in with the classic \"It\\'s not you, it\\'s me\" excuse. Fast forward 3 years to the end of summer before 12th grade starts. This girl named D that I kinda knew from school replies to a photo of my dog on IG and we start talking. I really like skateboarding and post a lot of videos of me skating and she complemented me on those. I told her that I could teach her if she wanted and after a little convincing we decided to meet. Initially I was REALLY nervous about meeting her. When I offered to teach her how to skate, I was just being friendly in hopes I might make a new friend to skate with. However she dropped some hints that she liked me which instantly made me 100x more nervous to meet her. I made one of my friends come along because I know he\\'s goofy and would take attention off me if I needed. Anyways the meeting went well and D and I continued to talk and become more friendly. After awhile we both know that we like each other and are basically bf and gf. For some reason D had this idea that someone had to explicitly ask the other person out for it to be a couple. She told me she wanted me to ask her out and I said that it\\'s silly to ask someone to ask you out. If you both want to date each other and both know that you want to date each other, then you\\'re basically bf and gf, no need for someone to ask the other out. Anyways she then asks me out a few weeks later and so I guess that\\'s technically the started of our relationship, but it\\'s whatever. I think we dated for around 5 months. D was the first girl that I ever truly felt like I loved. I genuinely felt like I would do anything for her and that I wanted to be with her forever. Then what felt like out of nowhere, she tells me she\\'s not happy and wants me to do more for her. She wants me to know what she wants without her telling me. I tell her I\\'ll try my best and we continue dating. A week later she dumps me because she just doesn\\'t like me anymore. For a few days I was extremely depressed. I sit through school feeling numb, then I\\'d come home and lie in bed watching youtube until it was time to fall asleep. I was even somewhat suicidal at some point. She also got mad at me because one of her guy friends threatened to beat the shit out of me if I talked to her and I basically called him a retarded and messed with him a little. Apparently in her mind, me messing with her friend was worse than him threatening to beat me up and so she stopped talking to me as well. At that point I wasn\\'t as depressed but I was still sad. But about a day after she stopped talking to me I suddenly realized that I didn\\'t need her. After I realized that, I instantly became happier. I stopped caring about her and started caring about myself. I started skating more often and talking to friends. It\\'s been about a month since we broke up and I\\'m feeling better than ever.

Hi, before I begin talking about my social anxiety, I would just like to say that this is not my usual account, I created this because I feel that it would hinder my ability to properly express myself if I use my personal account. Sorry if this infringes on any of the rules, I am not totally familiar with them. You can take this down if you want or let me know and I will fix/take it down for you. Im 18 years old, male and I believe that I have some form of social anxiety and I want to share how it has so far affected my life. I recently started university in the UK and I am in a flat of 13 other people. My earliest memory, and I believe one of the causes of my social anxiety was Christmas day when I was about 6 or 7. My Uncle came to our house for the first time (he lived in another country) and he brought a camcorder. He filmed us opening our presents and I was so excited I always wanted to be on camera and see myself on the TV. When I heard my voice on the TV aged 6, I wanted it turned off immediately. I try never to speak on camera even now. I have usually found it really really hard to make new friends. If I make one, I latch on to him as much as possible and usually divert any conversations to them if someone I know tries to initiate a conversation with me. Im currently at 6 weeks into university and I haven’t made any friends, which is my fault because I don’t initiate any conversations and any conversations that I do have last around 6 seconds because I don’t know what to say to people. Its usually, goes “Hi, (insert name here)” - Other person “Hi (insert name here)” – Me “How are you?” – Other person “Good, you?” – Me “Im good” – Other person “That’s good” – Me (Awkward pause and I walk off to avoid further embarrassment) I promised myself that on the first day I moved in I would introduce myself to everyone but when I walked in, they said hi and I got really hot and flustered and couldn’t. I rarely leave my room, only to go to lectures and seminars (which I worry about hours beforehand) and I often go days without eating proper food because people are currently in the kitchen. At School it was a little bit of a benefit because while people would take time in their work to talk, I would out of awkwardness, concentrate fully on my work. Now at university, they suggest that you join or form a study group with your friends, which is hard because Im on the other side of the country and I have no friends here. I am really worried how I will communicate with others when we have to start giving group presentations and working in groups. We haven’t even been assigned one yet and it already takes up hours of worry in my mind. I am worried because I want to be successful at whatever it is that I am doing but I cant properly talk to people and I know that this will be a huge hindrance. I have never approached someone of the opposite gender and talked to them, I don’t know what to say. I only have one friend who is a girl and its more a friendship of association because she is my friends girlfriends. One of the feelings that I get when I am around people is a feeling of inferiority. I am 5 foot 5, which is small for a male, and have always been the smallest in my class. I have been mistaken for up to 6 years younger than I am and I think this is one of the causes of it. I cant just talk to someone for the sake of it I have to have a reason otherwise I would be wasting their time. If someone else initiates a conversation with one of my friends or vice versa I stand there really really awkwardly. I cant wait in queues with a whole bunch of people because I feel like I am holding them up. If I am waiting to go into a lecture, I wait towards the back of the group because I don’t want to add to their displeasure of waiting. Its almost as if, subconsciously, that my presence offends people. Not that I think that I am in any way important, quite opposite, I feel like a nobody. If there was anything important that I needed to ask someone about that I didn’t know from school, I would do it on facebook, and even then it would take a few hours to come up with what I saw as the right way to frame this. Even for this post, I have to keep reminding myself that it is anonymous. My parents don’t know how seriously it affects me. They think Im shy and often when I was younger they would get cross because I wouldn’t socially interact with other people for summer camps, for example. Anyway, the purpose of this post was to share my experience with social anxiety and at least get a little bit of the pressure off my chest. Having not talked so freely in my entire life it feels that I have had a little bit of word vomit.

My 'issues' started when I was 15, as far as I know. Right before my birthday I had gone through what I would consider to be a traumatic experience. And so began the slow and dreadful downhill spiral into complete nothingness. First I was just homeschooled. Then I lost all contact with supposed friends. Then the outside world completely. At this point I was still functional enough to mow the lawn and go to basic places like doctors, dentists, grocery stores, etc. Those eventually all stopped and I isolated myself, pretty much professionally if I do say so myself. After a while of kind of enjoying being alone I started not enjoying it so much. I found myself daydreaming of having friends and those memorable moments that don't take place on your mom's couch. And after not too long of that, I started feeling like I would die without it. But I didn't know how to talk to people anymore. What to say, how to act, what to do. In just a few short years I forgot how to be a human. I still have no fucking clue of what to do in social situations. But, and now fast forward to the present. I don't like people anymore and now those 'dreams' of having friends have turned into full blown nightmares of having (keyword having) to do stuff eventually. I can't just hide from the world my entire life no matter what 'reasons' I have. It's confusing though. I never maintain the same perspective for more than a few days. Some days I wake up feeling lonely, and praying for someone to text me. Others, I wake up not even being able to stand my little siblings saying good morning to me. On top of that, there's not voices, but there's definitely two different versions of my voice in my head. I'll attempt to provide at least a decent example.

Version #2, I feel like I have a 2 inch soggy day old breadstick from Little Caesar's say between my legs and I'm nothing more than the scum of the earth.

Then there's days where I wish I could hit the lottery. Just to hire a group of Russian mercenaries to kill all the stupid people that annoy me. The worst part, I'm not even talking about genuinely annoying. I'm talking about my version. Example, someone asking me a question that I feel is pointless, makes my head ring, and I go back to the thought of hiring mercenaries. I can't really explain this part well, but I feel like people do shit on purpose. There's NO way the general public is so stupid, and annoying that I actually pray for mass genocide on a daily basis.

I almost fell over and at first I was so shocked that I didn\\'t say anything as they walked away (just walked, didn\\'t even try to run) and my anxiety kicked in and I thought \"just don\\'t say anything\" but then about 10 seconds pass and I decided to shout at them. The time elapsed probably gave off signals that I\\'m not very assertive, plus my anxiety was probably evident so they just laughed at me and ran off. I continued walking, feeling pretty shit about myself. I sat down in my usual spot and I tried to relax but I couldn\\'t. I felt really anxious and shaky. I\\'m a pretty sensitive guy anyway, but this is something I\\'ve never experienced before and I kept playing over in my head how lame I sounded when I shouted at them and I actually felt like crying. While I was sitting under a tree, feeling terrible and trying not to cry in public I saw them come back over to me and one of them threw a rock at me. It didn\\'t hit me, but it freaked me out. Then before I could say anything, they started throwing rocks at windows, trying to break them. Seeing them again actually made me feel calm, my anxiety lifted. I was really nervous about passing them again to leave the park, but then when I saw them I realised they were just a bunch of idiot kids and I felt alright. Anyway, I called the police and they picked me up in a van and we drove around the neighbourhood trying to find them but couldn\\'t so they drove me home. I was hoping we\\'d catch them, because even though that would mean I would have had to face them again, I kind of wanted them to realise I wasn\\'t some push over who just allows kids to assault me. I wanted to talk to them again and teach them a lesson. But overall it worked out fine, so I\\'m happy about that. I tried my best and I feel good now, as opposed to anxious and shaky.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'I did it! I got my hair cut!. Im going to apologize in advance and just say that I often give too many details in my stories making them very long but that\\'s just how I do it. I like to explain everything. My thought process what I was thinking and feeling.. A few days ago I realised that my hair had gotten pretty long. It had been around 3 months since my last haircut. I know it was before December 24 2015. For a few hours last night before I went to bed I was trying to look up places I could get my hair cut. The price and how long it would take to walk. Every time I\\'ve had my hair cut and the hairdresser asks how to cut it I just stutter a \"err idk just shorter. Do what you want\" and in a thread I\\'ve made before about getting my hair cut people were suggesting that I show a picture of what I want done. So I looked up pictures of myself on phone and narrowed it down to 3 pictures I believe were taken a week or two after I had my hair cut. \"This looks short enough. I\\'ll just show them this\". The whole day leading up to me entering the door to the haircutter I was thinking \"should I go. Should I just do it another day\" but each step I took (eating breakfast, getting dressed, going outside) that got me closer to the haircutter the more forced I felt to actually go through with it. I tried to think less and just do it. The place is a rather small place and you can\\'t even pay with a card, only cash (as I found out) and the guy who cut my hair didn\\'t speak the language very well. When I went in there were 2 employees and the boss. All being with a customer and cutting their hair so I sit down and wait. Usually the place is pretty full (as I said it\\'s a pretty small room) and I was worried about looking like a fool in front of other customers trying to ask if they had time for a drop-in customer. A lot of people who go there seems to be friends with the owner too or know them very well which makes it feel worse. Like if the owner is just a complete stranger to them then we have something in common. I sit there for a couple of minutes and the owner (who\\'s cutting someone\\'s hair) makes eye contact with me like he\\'s wondering what I\\'m doing. Making me feel anxious ish. A guy walks in, he clearly knows the owner, after a bit he asks how long until he\\'s free. Owner says 5m and the guy goes outside to smoke or whatever. So there I am, just sitting there awkwardly, wondering if I should be asking if they have time for a drop in or something. Or do I just wait here until one of them is done cutting and stands behind the register?? Ofc i chose to sit there like a socially awkward dude. Once the owner is done with his customer he starts to get ready to go outside for a smoke break. I didn\\'t stand up or talk to him I just sat awkwardly. I felt like I had missed an opportunity. But a minute or so after that the other guy was done cutting his customers hair too and I asked him if he has time for a drop in and he said yes. And here\\'s the best part. Remember, this is the very first time I was going to show the haircutter a picture of how I want mine cut, so I had rehearsed it a million times in my head already. Show picture, say I want something like that, sit down. I awkwardly say \"is. . I brought a picture\" I pull up my phone which has the picture already loaded. \"Something like this?\" He takes the phone and asks \"do this?\" I\\'m like ..yeah do that. Like that. A few moments of silence after I sit down, he seems hesitant to cut it like that. \"Like that or.. better\" NO YOU\\'RE DEVIATING FROM THE SCRIPT. \"Ehh heh better I guess if you can\" are the words that leave my mouth. He says \"this picture.. not very good. Not that good looking hair\" I\\'m like well shit I spent like 10 minutes anxious over which picture to use and it\\'s not a great pic I agree but it\\'s fine. It\\'s short. I just want it shorter. So I say \"heh yeah do better if you can then. If you want\". \"I can do better\" he says and starts cutting. Once he\\'s done he says something and I was like huh what did you say? I asked that maybe 2 to 3 times during that whole visit. I felt like such an incompetent ass. Oh remember how I didn\\'t know it was a cash only place? He said nope sorry can\\'t pay with card here. And I\\'m like oh god.. \"where can I find an atm..\" he says around the corner \"you know where?\" I Say no and he gestures again around the corner. So I go around the corner but see no atm I ask 2 women passing by where the nearest atm is and it\\'s a biiit further away. Around another corner. I feel like the haircutter might think I\\'m not gonna pay so I had intentionally left my jacket behind. Had to stand in line for the atm (lady took god same forever) and I was thinking about how long it was taking me to get back so I could frikken pay him. Anyway I finally had it done. Usually my dad drives me to some place and comes with me (since he has to wait for me anyway) which makes me feel like shit and like a child. I\\'m 22. It looks good now I think and I rode the high of \" I did something today \" for a few hours after that. If you actually read everything then I\\'m sorry haha. I should learn how to be more concise but I just feel like I want to convey every detail possible. As if the person listening to my story was there. That\\'s why I like pictures. Shows what it actually is like instead of them having to imagine it. Maybe it just looks like a lot cus I\\'m on my phone.

I really don\\'t know where to start because my anxiety spreads across many categories. The most prominent and most harmful,though, is my fear of rejection. I am constantly dwelling on my peers\\' apparent perception of me. After every action I make, whether it be getting out of my chair or commenting on a coworkers statement, I analyze the body/facial expression of the other parties in the room. Most of the time my interpretation is a negative one. I am a first born child and am comfort able with my alone time and quite enjoy it but my ADHD makes me outgoing and talkative (though sometimes about obscure topics). I very much enjoy the connection from carrying on a conversation with someone and knowing that they understand and empathize with you. Throughout high-school I was the class clown. I always had some snide remark to make or an opinion to give on everything. I had my small group of friends but I felt that I annoyed even them. I graduated HS and decided enough was enough. I\\'m not gonna be that obnoxious guy anymore. I got back on my medicine and went off to college. Screwed up pretty bad my first semester and got kicked out of my housing (still enrolled ). I felt horrible about it because the offense that got me kicked out was something I told my parents I stopped doing a while back when they caught me. Anyway.. At this point I had just started to make friends outside of the people I knew from my hometown and I could see things about to turn around. But when I found out that I was being kicked out of my housing and wasting my parents 8k they had already spent on the following semester housing as well as the rent for the new place I fell into a really bad depression. I lost connection with all of my friends except one( who happened to be my previous roommate and got kicked out with me). We felt each other\\'s pain and consoled one another with alcohol and Xbox one. I started drinking .. A lot. Like everyday. Ironically it didn\\'t affect my grades though because we were still in freshman level courses and Calc always came easy to me. Fast forward 1 year. Me and roommate get a new place together and are doing great(or so it seems). We move into a little college apt complex where I already knew a ton of people. That first semester was great. We got along great daily and never fought. Shit we still have never fought. We hung out with the same group of friends and I was even more popular than him! I was having a great time and really loved my roommate/best friend like a brother. Then winter break came. All was going great. Still partying in my hometown and catching up with old friends and still hanging out with the ones that came home from school with me. Blah blah blah I ran into a girl from one of my classes downtown one night and we made plans to hangout. I brought a friend she brought a friend. The friend she brought ended up being my girlfriend and first love of 2 years. And my friend and the other girl hooked up a little but that\\'s a different story.... Getting tired of typing on phone so I\\'m gonna wrap it up ... Roommate and Girl from downtown start talking. (Me and that girl always had some spark between us but never made a move on it again story for another time) girl talks shit about roommate behind his back to me (dumb) calls him gay and says she only hangs out with him for a gay cuddle buddy. I tell him he doesn\\'t believe me. Asks her she denies it. She keeps talking shit. She starts getting really controlling and making him look like her puppy following her around and conforming to her every whim. It was nauseating. At this point there was a little tension between her and I as I was obviously not gonna take her side on things because she was manipulating my best friend and I was pretty blatant about that. But I decided to take the high road and still be her friend and what not. Things started to go south. She started to act weird and say passively rude things to me when she was drunk but never out right aggressive. She started to resent my other friend (the one that hooked up with her a while back ) and would be very aggressive with him at parties. To the point of getting him kicked out of a few. I didn\\'t care, he was being an ass most of the time and deserved it. Then she started lumping me into her little outbursts. And one night she got particularly drunk and went off on him. Once he was kicked out she turned it on me. I didn\\'t even listen to it though cause she was obviously obliterated so I just walked home. Next weekend there was a birthday party down the road from me and she was going as well as all my friends so I decided to go. Stayed for an hour or so but didn\\'t know many people and was getting bored so I went to leave. Said my good byes to the people I knew there and went for the door. Saw roommate and girl sitting by the door. Said bye to roommate and went to say bye to her but she was obviously ignoring me so I patted her lightly on the head and kindly said \"bye \\'girl\\'\" and opened the door. I hear \"did he just pat me on the head?? Is he calling me a dog or something ?!?\" I try to b line out of this drunken situation before it manifests into a full on shit show. But I was too late. She runs for the door and shoves me as much as she could and yells \"GET OUT!\" ( her signature drunken outburst at the time ) I turned around and calmly said \"\\'girl\\' I didn\\'t mean to offend you, we\\'re all friends here I\\'m sorry, you\\'re just drunk\" or something along those lines. She stops her feet in place and yells for roommate at the top of her lungs. And like clock work he comes running out of no where and stands by her side. I had had enough so I just grabbed my girl by the arm and we walked home. Then things started to get weird. I talked to my roommate about it and asked him why she was mad at me. He said she wasn\\'t. Okay cool. So i tried talking to her and she ignores me. Okay so I ask him again same response. Wtf roommate bros before hoes right? Apparently he had never heard the expression. Then a day would pass when I didn\\'t see or hear from him. Which hadn\\'t happened since the day I met him. Oh well I figured I\\'d let them work it out. Then weeks passed. Then we\\'d talk about bullshit. Then more weeks. Then a month. Then the semester was over and he left without saying a word. We had already signed a lease for the next semester and he told me a week before the next semester that he had backed out last minute and was living somewhere else. Great Well he moves in with some of my so called friends and then I lost contact with most of them as they were girls friends before mine. So I was slowly phased out of the group and then was all alone. And social anxiety has just snowballed.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'Friendless people, the key to not feeling like the worst person in the world is to stop caring (to state the obvious). For a while I never understood people who posted on here and on other subs saying they have no friends but they\\'re okay with that. If they\\'re okay with it it won\\'t change! But I was wrong. 90% of people are going to think you\\'re a weirdo for not having friends, but they don\\'t know you, and they\\'re shallow. No one is going to support your loneliness so you might as well accept that sometimes shit happens in life and you end up alone for a while but that\\'s okay and natural. I think the guilt of loneliness affects your mental health before the actual loneliness does. Growing up I became more and more aware of my lack of friends. I had more friends then than I have now, but less than most people I knew. For a long time I didn\\'t see the problem. When I didn\\'t see my lack of friends as a problem, this meant that when I was having a social interaction I wasn\\'t self conscious. I didn\\'t have my mothers voice in the back of my head telling me I should have more friends. I remember in school, between the ages of 12-16, I would yap and yap to anyone, and no, I didn\\'t make friends with everyone I talked to, but I made some, and was generally liked. As I got older, I cut off a group of friends from my home town because I had nothing in common with them and they were preoccupied with being popular and I wasn\\'t. My mam would always say that I needed more friends when she noticed I stopped hanging around them. I remember I brought 2 friends home for dinner and my sister said \"oh look, her friends. All 2 of them\". I became more aware of my loneliness. As my awareness increased, I got more withdrawn, basically a hermit, was overly critical of myself and overly self conscious. Because everyone around me was telling me it wasn\\'t okay to have few friends, even though I had been happy. Something that struck me in college was how everyone sort of acted as if they wanted to be perceived as popular. This was probably my warped SA perception, and this stopped me from talking to people. Sometimes I read threads here, particularly /r/relationships (my favourite sub) and see people talking about how having no friends is a \"red flag\" and that \"boring people finish last\" and that when you have no friends \"you\\'re the common denominator\" and there\\'s something wrong with you. I see where they\\'re coming from, and while reading things like this serves to make us all more self aware, it doesn\\'t make it easier, and it\\'s not healthy to blame yourself. I had an epiphany recently and I realized that... people in my hometown probably don\\'t talk about me negatively, if I talked to them they\\'d probably be open to me. People I meet daily that I think hate me, don\\'t hate me, if they do they\\'re basing it off one encounter, they don\\'t know me and I shouldn\\'t care. When I walk my dog, people who see me out in public don\\'t know I\\'m unemployed and friendless, or that my hair is really greasy. No one but me has felt my pain or understands, so screw it. Even if I have screwed up my reputation by being a recluse, it\\'s so easy to change how people see you, if you only have the courage to try. There\\'s no point in feeling guilt about SA. We are going to find friends at some point or another, our SA will die down eventually with personal growth or outside help. We might as well be okay with our circumstances in the meantime. I used to spend all my alone time (so, all the time) feeling bad about it, but what\\'s the point? That will only make me more bitter. Let\\'s stop acting like having no friends is the worst thing in the world. We\\'re not actually missing out on much, maybe this realization will help us to stop trying too hard in social situations and messing up. Loneliness is painful but only because other people make it painful by reminding us how flawed we are. I know it\\'s impossible to implement \"stop caring\" overnight, but please try. I hope other friendless people out there can get to the point in life where they don\\'t care what others think, because after 22 years it has finally freed me. *Tl;dr: People make us feel shit for not having friends. But realize if people didn\\'t make us feel shit about ourselves, we\\'d probably be okay. Try and get to the point where you realize that it\\'s okay to be who you are and be happy alone. Stop comparing yourself to others and just stop caring what people think.

I\\'ve never been bar hopping, not even a bar since I turned 21 (in April. Normally I just go to the liquor store down the street and drink with my roommate or by myself). I told them I\\'ve never done it before so if they could guide me through it that\\'d be great, and they said sure. So it comes time to start walking. One of the guys is already drunk, the other is super experienced with this stuff. I felt so out of place. Not to mention they were wearing shirts that supported the home team (football game AND homecoming tonight, that alone should have told me it\\'d be way too busy for me to handle, especially for my first time at a bar). I was wearing what I normally wear, some jeans and a black sweater and nasty grey vans that I wore to work today and forgot to change out of. Not to mention these guys are way taller than me. I\\'m not even short, I\\'m 5\"11 but they were a few inches taller than me so all of this combined made me feel so out of place. So basically I was going into a social anxiety nightmare already anxious a fuck for other reasons than I was going out. Fuck. The walk took about 15 minutes, felt like forever, but when I got to the bar, I felt like it didn\\'t take long enough. This bar was packed beyond reason. Inside it didn\\'t look like there was anywhere to even move. And the line was massive. Halfway up, my friend decided now was the best time to mention there\\'s a $5 front. I didn\\'t know what that meant (in case someone doesn\\'t either, it means a $5 fee to get in). I had already told him I didn\\'t have any cash on me but he said don\\'t worry, they take debit cards. Here\\'s where I really start to panic. I ask if he can spot me and he said no, I should have brought cash with me. Fucking hell. Second panic: the people behind me are so close, like they kept brushing up against me and bumping into me. I can\\'t stand people touching me unexpectedly. But I\\'m at a bar, obviously that happens. But I start to freak out thinking the people around me can hear me say I don\\'t have the money, asking me friend, not knowing what to do, thinking they think I\\'m a loser for not knowing how to do this. I\\'m just about to leave because I\\'m about to have a break down. I tell my \"friend\" I think I\\'m just going to bail. He\\'s like yea okay whatever. I then start thinking the people behind me are thinking I\\'m even more of a loser for bailing and not doing what everyone else is doing. I end up saying fuck it and I start walking away. I walked towards the Taco Bell across the street and call my roommate and ask him to pick me up there. He said he was actually on his way to his girlfriend\\'s. I said oh never mind then, I don\\'t want you to drive all that way. He said it\\'s not a big deal and he comes to pick me up. Now I feel bad about inconveniencing him.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'As a homeschooler, I feel like something was stolen from me.. Hello everyone. This is my first time posting here, I\\'ll try to keep it simple and organized. I have been homeschooled from Pre-K to senior year, and I am 18 now. For the most part I have been oblivious to the public perception of this method of teaching. I see everywhere online that it\\'s kind of frowned upon. People say that homeschoolers are anti-social white-trash potential school shooters. Everytime I see these comments I feel a strong pang in my chest. I actually don\\'t consider myself to be very weird, I am kind of average to be honest. I am obsessed with music, love my netflix, and enjoy travelling. Not very weird I wouldn\\'t think. I try very hard to hide the fact that I was homeschooled, simply because I immediately get lumped into these stereotypes. As a homeschooler, I feel like something was stolen from me. I never asked to be different. It doesn\\'t feel fair to me that I have this burden of an alternate lifestyle. I think it kind of stems from my personality. I hate conflict and hostile opinions. Which might be caused by my homeschooling. Such a mess right? My mother has a strong passion for homeschooling, and I remember her telling me that she would cry if I decided (or got forced by CPS) to go to public school. This created a sort of \"guilty conscious, or feeling that I have to stick with the program to keep her happy. She would actually threaten to \"put me in public school\" if I tried to talk to her about my doubts. Don\\'t get the wrong idea about her though, I love her and can kind of see where she\\'s coming from. She may have had a bad time in high school, so it\\'s like a terror to her. But, I don\\'t feel like I would have had the same experience. Sometimes I daydream about what I could have been like if I went to public school. Maybe I would some kind of sauve marauder! Or at least I would be assertive enough, self-relient, and have a good group of friends. Instead, I am just an awkward burden for most people my age. I feel like I was cheated a better life almost. I also have extreme insecurities when it comes to intelligence. Actually, anytime I think I see proof of my being stupid, I respond emotionally. Again, the pang in my chest feeling. I feel like my education could have been better, for the past few years I have mainly been teaching myself because my mom is hella busy. I am working on my ACT and I\\'ll hopefully get into college, which I am not sure I can do since I am a homeschooler. I don\\'t even know if I have a GPA, because there hasn\\'t been any kind of grading going on, not that I know of anyway. I am really good at math, but not so good at factoid/common-sense stuff. Right now I am in a jiu-jitsu class (free at my gym) and my instructor will constantly ask for a factoid, like \"How much blood is in the body?\" or \"What\\'s the fastest animal on Earth\". I couldn\\'t answer either of these, and it really bothers me. I feel like I should know this stuff, and I might have known it if I was in public school. Sometimes I will know one, but can\\'t think of it fast enough. Somehow, I always end up looking like an idiot in front of my class. Whether it be not answering questions, or having an insanely hard time with directions and spatial awareness. Yes, the homeschooling was for religious reasons. My mom says it\\'s because she met a homeschooler and was impressed, but I kind of doubt that. She\\'s an extreme Christian of sorts. She taught me creation science for a while, but I learned how it\\'s fraudulent. I have a basic understanding of evolution now, but I probably don\\'t know as much as other people my age. She\\'s also a big conspirator. Alex Jones, 9/11 Truth, FEMA, etc. I believed these too, but have since shaken them off. I am actually still in the closet about a lot of this stuff because I don\\'t want to have a heated discussion with her. I am still a Christian, but I have a lot of problems with religion. I guess it\\'s more of a personal thing that I don\\'t feel the need to express or go to church for. I have never had a girlfriend. I have never even had a kiss before. I have held hands with a girl and I took one on a date. But, the date was a disaster (she was kind of a bitch, and she didn\\'t consider it to be a date) and the \"holding hands\" part grossed me out. It\\'s starting to drive me crazy in a way, I really want to experience love, romance, and sex are like. But I feel like I have been permanently cockblocked by my upbringing. I\\'ll probably die a virgin. Anytime I have been close to starting something up with a girl, my mom wasn\\'t too far behind me. I feel like once they see my mom and the interactions we have, they write me off as a \"momma\\'s boy\" and immediately lose any attraction they once had. I am actually a pretty attractive looking guy, but the way I am drives them away. I have never had a job (unless you could call mowing your grandmother\\'s grass a real job). I have a supreme fear of the unknown here. Like I feel like they won\\'t hire me because I am not the best at social skills. Or, I feel like I am going to fuck up really bad with whatever they assign for me. Or, I feel like I will get bullied by coworkers and have a horrible time there. The real world is a scary concept to me, I have seen how horrible people can be on the internet (especially with the \\'kys\\' and red hot angry comments). I feel like I am too soft for the world, too sheltered. I feel like I will get eaten alive almost. So, it creates a vicious cycle, I don\\'t know when I\\'ll get a job, or what job I will get. But I know I need to get one because I\\'ll need a source of income soon (I rarely spend my money, so I have a lot of it). Because I don\\'t have a job and don\\'t exactly have a \"rich family\". I don\\'t have a phone, or a car. I have to use my parents phone and car anywhere I go, and I hate it. It severely stifles my freedom. I couldn\\'t go do anything without them knowing, I know this for a fact. My dream is to shed the stereotypical image I have and live a meaningful life. I want to have good friends, a wife, a good job, a house, etc. I don\\'t want to be seen as that weird guy, or that loner, I want to be somebody. I don\\'t know where to start, even though I was brought up in a good household (no domestic violence or anything), I carry a lot of baggage.

            "{'sequence': \"('I negotiated a 10,000$ increase to my salary. Hello SA, I want to share with you guys a milestone that I never thought I’d ever reach, and furthermore, a milestone that the past me would never have even dreamt as possible. My hope is that I can inspire people to see that it is truly is possible for anyone to massively and significantly improve themselves and fight through their own social anxiety. Warning, this post is quite long, but if you enjoy reading about a person’s journey’s to self-improvement, then this post is for you. A bit of backstory on me. I’m 22 right now, but I’ve been fighting social anxiety ever since I was in fifth grade (that’s rounds out to about half of my life). For as long as I remember, I hated myself, and there was a multitude of reasons for this such as growing up poor in a rich area, being different from all my peers (mixed race, foreign sounding name, etc.), and not seeing a healthy relationship between my mother and father. The way I coped with my insecurities was through video games. Lots and lots of video games. It was so easy to escape the reality I hated by living in another one that made me feel alive. I did this for years and years, throughout middle school and especially through high school and into college. With all the time I invested into video games, I was severely underdeveloped in my social skills, and I’d even pit myself in the bottom 10% next to anti-social deaf people. Everywhere I go, I would avoid eye contact with people. I hated even going outside and seeing other people, because I just knew how awkward and weird they would think I am for the way I looked and the way I walked. Class was a nightmare. I’d try to sit in the back, and every time the teacher would call on me, my heart would race to the speed of light, and my voice would quiver as I attempted to formulate a semi-coherent sentence. By now you might be wondering how the hell did I transform from this video game addicted, socially awkward boy with low self-esteem into a person that could stand up for himself? Answer: I got tired. Tired of living life feeling like a piece of shit. Tired of not even being able to look into the mirror without cringing. Tired of thinking I wasn’t worth anyone’s time, and that I’ll die alone. And that’s when I discovered /r/socialanxiety. For the first time I saw that I wasn’t the only one in the world dealing with what I thought was my own unique personal hell. I heard stories, stories of peoples’ struggles, and even some of their success. But to be honest, I never found enough actionable advice here to steer my life in the right direction, so I started looking elsewhere. I started looking at other subreddits, and I even started reading self-improvement books and listening to podcasts. Somewhere around this point, something finally clicked in my head that me realize that change is possible, “even for me.” Here are three steps I followed to transform my life after believing that I could transform my life: Step 1) I started an exercise regimen and eating healthier. Even though my routine sucked and I made every mistake in the book, the small progress I made further made me see that I could improve my own physique through grit and not shoving junk food down my throat. Let’s not kid ourselves, appearances do matter, not so much that they should dominate every ounce of your thought and life focus, but I’ve come to learn that neglecting it and pretending like it doesn’t matter only perpetuated a cycle of negative thoughts about myself such as “I’ll never look good, I’m not like that, I’m ugly, etc.” If you feel ugly now, working out and dressing decently can unsurprisingly improve the way you feel about yourself. Try it. If you’re fighting social anxiety like I was, you’re going to need every bit of improvement you can get and this one can even be done without any social interaction (though that is against the road of improvement). Step 2) I started paying attention to my body language. I think this may be one of the hardest points to tackle as a person with SA, and I can’t even say that my own personal body language is in tip top shape as of yet, but I can say that even by being aware that body language exists puts you miles ahead of the average person with SA. So much communication is portrayed through the body, such as standing up straight, not looking down at the ground, and even just how you deal with silence. If you’re a guy and you’re into girls, this a quality that is heavily observed, much more so than the verbal communication. If you’re a girl, you probably know this and have more of knack for this than the average guy does. However complicated this may seem, simple things that I mentioned such as standing up straight and keeping your head-up can psychologically boost your mood. Step 3) I did things I was uncomfortable with, step by step. I think this is the hardest and most crucial step of my process, and it could be divided into countless sub-steps and stories, but I want to hit the main point that the only way to become comfortable is to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. Here’s an example. I’m at grocery store, I really don’t want to ask the worker for help finding an item. But I do it, just to see what will happen. I’m nervous. I approach her and ask where the broccoli is. She tells me it’s on aisle seven. “Shit I don’t where aisle seven is, should I ask her, no she’ll think I’m weird.” I nod okay and walk away quickly. “Shit, why didn’t I ask her to point me to where aisle seven is .“ I find another worker, then ask if he can show me to aisle seven, and sure enough he happily tells me where to go. I realize this isn’t so bad and am now not afraid to ask for directions. The point of this example is take small steps and experiment for yourself. The more you do, the more you will learn. And I hate to say it, but most of what we learn isn’t through others, but by our own doing, and especially doing things that we think will suck. Now I could tell my own personal stories on this topic for pages and pages, but I want to highlight that I’ve done things as uncomfortable as confronting someone about their shitty behavior, asking girls to dates (*gasp*, no way, how is that possible, as my old self would say), actually being on the date and making mistakes (learning mistakes I’ll have you know), and even performing on a stage in front of a live audience. But the most recent highlight is negotiating my salary at my current job. I did my research about my current job that I’m getting hired for, and I noticed that I was being heavily underpaid for the position. I knew that being underpaid would make me feel resentment as an employee and not allow me to do my best work, so I decided “fuck it, rather than have a terrible time at this position feeling passive-aggressive about my situation and being weird in the office, I’m going to tackle this right now.” I looked up as many negotiation tactics as possible, spent time in the shower for a week debating with my manager in my imagination, and finally reassured myself that I know my worth. I approached my manager 2 days ago. Long story short, I nailed the negotiation and got a 10k salary raise. All the uncomfortable things I ever dealt with leading up to this made me the person I was going into that negotiation. All the hard work, mistakes, pain, and learning that I did made me become someone who was worthy of that 10k raise. If you threw 16 year old, or even 20 year old socially awkward me into the same position, I would not have not have raised a single word. I probably would not have even passed the interview for this job. As long as this post has been, there’s so many details that I left out, but I really hope that I’ve demonstrated that it is truly is possible to fight your own social anxiety, and even use it as fuel to better yourself. I still have lots of room to grow, and I’m not the most socially savvy or charming person you’ll ever meet, but I can say with confidence and pride that I’m 100 times better than the person I used to be.')\", 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with positive effect', 'outdoor activity or space with negative effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect'], 'scores': [0.3475428521633148, 0.3292158246040344, 0.32324138283729553]}\n",
            "{'sequence': '(\\' Will soon be having a conversation with my manager about my SA... Hey guys. So I\\'m a lower level supervisor where I work and today I had to get together with a group of my co-workers and my manager to go over some things that they (co-workers) haven\\'t been completing on a consistent basis. Performance stuff basically. My manager and I had talked the night before about how we were going to approach the meeting and we agreed I would try and take the lead on most of the conversation and he would chime in when necessary. He, as well as a majority of management (big company, lots of higher-ups) know that I have some anxiety issues, but don\\'t really know the extent of it for the most part. So the meeting didn\\'t go all that great. Not terrible, but not very good. I started things off and kind of just nose dived into what the group of co-workers had done wrong the day before. No intro, no nice lead in or explanation as to why we were there. Just \"ok so this wasn\\'t done, that was dirty, this wasn\\'t taken care of..\" etc, etc. My manager ended up back-packing the meeting per usual and the day continued on as it normally would. Well towards the end of the day he wanted to get together again (just him and I) so that we could talk about how it went. We go into the same room where we held the meeting that morning which is this bright ass (like apple store bright) conference room and we start to chat. We go over some normal day to day stuff and then we get on the subject of how we think the meeting went. I told him I think it could have gone better and he agrees which is why he wanted to talk with me to begin with. I told him I\\'m particularly aware of my public speaking difficulties and that I know I could have directed the meeting in a more constructive way. I told him I struggle with certain things and that I\\'ve been devoting a lot of time outside of work to try and help with that stuff. Then he stopped me and asked me what type of struggles.. I paused for a second and said \"oh, well I have anxiety and uh..\" pause, not looking at him.. \"it\\'s just been really hard and, uh..\" At this moment I started to well up with tears. He could tell I was on the verge of crying and I knew I would if I said anything else so I told him I needed to step away for a second. So I stepped into an empty office and just tried to wait out the emotion. I was completely, utterly overwhelmed. After a couple minutes he came over and asked me if I\\'d Iike to walk outside with him for a bit. We took a walk around the neighboring businesses while I, thoroughly embarrassed, stammered out the few sentences of explanation that I could (I should say that my manager is a really good dude, fairly close to my age and also super understanding). He let me know that he\\'s all ears if I\\'d like to try and talk about everything at a later time as I was just about finished with my shift for the day. I told him that I\\'ve actually been wanting to do that for a while so we agreed that he\\'d give me a call within the next couple of days to discuss things.. I know I need to talk about a lot with him, I just don\\'t know *how* much. Do I tell him the full truth? That I\\'m severely depressed because of my SA and that if affects me every day of my life? That it drastically inhibits my ability to perform as a supervisor? I was on the verge of breaking down at work which is something I\\'ve never done, ever. Let alone in front of my boss. I\\'ve spent my whole life trying to hide my SA and have developed an ultra thick, guarded wall as a result. I\\'ve avoided these types of conversations with people (other than my family) because of how overwhelming the emotions become. I\\'m scared that if I completely open up to him I\\'ll raise serious questions about my ability to perform my job requirements. Either way, the dynamic between him and I will absolutely not be the same after this convo. This post became way, waay longer than I meant it to be. Cheers if you made it all the way to the end. Thank you..sincerely, for any responses. TL;DR I ended up nearly crying in front of my manager after being overwhelmed with emotions when asked to elaborate on my struggles with SA. We planned a follow up conversation at a later time so that I can gather myself and allow for a proper explanation. Now I\\'m just not sure how much I want to share with him as I\\'m scared it might jeopardize my job, or at least my standings within my department. \\')', 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with positive effect', 'outdoor activity or space with negative effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect'], 'scores': [0.3764015734195709, 0.3299029767513275, 0.2936954200267792]}\n",

I wasn't shy I could male new friends and talk to other kids with no worries at all. I went to a school that was k-8 I stayed there all the way till 8th grade and so did pretty much everyone from my starting kindergarten class did the same so we were real close shared birthday parties , had sleepovers all of us were on a soccer team for a good while. But at around 5th grade i started to get a bit chubby i dont know if it was pubery or my aunt always giving me treats. And the same friends who i had known since kindergarten started teasing me not all but most also we were kinda finding who we were and making our groups of friends. So this put me down to where i didnt wanna go to birthday parties anymore or do things with them because i knew I would be made fun of or called fat or asked why my face was red all the time so i started staying home alot. My dad didn't like this so he would make me go to these events where i would be teased. I never told him and I would have to make a scene to not go. So he gave up on me going and i kinda just stayed at home all the way till we graduated till 8th grade I wasn't the weird kid everyone made fun of i had friends i guess I just got used to being teased brushed it off and all that bit it bothered me i would have breakdowns cry askingy parents if I was fat. I went to a different high school then everyone else didn't grt teased and felt a bit better i geaduated got in shape and all but all of that just kinda left a mark.

Those who are ‘meant’ to read this  and offer guidance, will. I hope :) No idea how to cut it down into a TLDR as it is far too lengthy. I'll try to keep this first backstory as short  and to the point as possible. I'm 21, live in Australia on the east coast, grew up in Sydney and lived there until I was 18. I have a sister who is 7 years older who still lives in our hometown. Lost my father at a young age at 13. I've been battling depression for over 5 years since I was 15. I moved 2 hours away from my hometown at 18  and my depression got much worse. I stopped seeing friends, stopped going out, stopped talking to my friends/family which led to dealing with anxiety issues which led to social anxiety due to isolating myself. (Among other symptoms) I've recently started seeing a psychologist, getting out of the house more, I'm finally starting to feel like going out  and doing things. I want to meet people. I've been out more/done more in January of this year than I have the past 2 years. Finally starting to feel 'normal'. I still haven't reconnected with any of my old friends. I haven't posted anything on my personal social media accounts (Facebook/Instagram/Snapchat) since I first moved in late 2014. Haven't spoken to any friends since then  and haven't seen them either. Some have reached out to me but I never replied. Haven’t had a job since I moved up here either. For some reason I'm still afraid to reach out to them because I know that will lead to eventually meeting up with them in person. I'm even afraid to post anything on social media from fear of them reaching out to me. Because I know this will lead down the same route. I haven't made any new friends since moving from my hometown, haven't worked or studied  and basically feel like a complete failure. Afraid of what they will say, think or feel about me cos I have no life per say. I have already made a post looking for advice/guidance regarding the issue related to my old friends, however the above context was necessary to lead onto my next story which I am solely looking for advice/guidance for. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ New years eve I went to a house party with my older Sister cos I had nothing else to do, literally, and met all her friends etc. People were drinking, majority of people were on drugs, MDMA, LSD  and Ketamine was available. I hadn’t had drugs for 3 years since Australia day in 2014 when I was 18. I didn’t plan on taking anything. I met a girl who lived there, friend of my sisters who’s my age - lets call her Mary. I was told by a few people she thought I was attractive  and wanted to hookup. I haven’t hooked up with anyone for over 2 years and I actually was thinking that about her anyway so I was keen. I was drinking a lot when I first got there because of my anxiety, meeting new people etc. and ended up having to stop drinking because I was getting sick mixing it with weed. (Only drank 4 times last year so I had a very low tolerance). A few hours later I was in Marys room with her, my sister  and another girl who lived there just talking; lets call her Barbara. Barbara asked if we all wanted to get any more MDMA caps (her bf had stuff people could buy during the night). All of them had already taken an MDMA cap each earlier on in the night  and they all said yeah to having another one, which left me to decide; I ended up asking for one since I felt comfortable, didn’t feel pressured by them and the moment felt right to do it (granted my judgement was way off cause I was drinking/smoking; not the best idea to jump on drugs with people you barely know, but I felt safe being with my sister). So I took mine with them  and they left me and Mary in the room not long after. Started talking to Mary, getting to know her and all that. Basically having a d andm. She was telling me that she is going overseas this year to a US summer camp for 6 weeks. I felt so unaccomplished  and like a loser basically because there’s no way I could do that. I told her she’s really ambitious  and we started talking about other things while smoking weed together. We ended up hooking up for awhile, kissed at midnight  and started talking more after that. At one point while we were outside having a cigarette, she asked me to tell her ‘my life story’, it caught me off guard cos if I’m honest I don’t even know what it is. I got about halfway through  and somehow we got interrupted and I never got to hear hers or finish mine. I realised I was saying a lot of bad things that had happened in my life, rather than who I am and what I do? Anyway, Mary  and Barbara decided to come back with me, my sister  and her partner back to their place about an hour or two after Midnight to spend the rest of the night together. They were all going to take a tab of LSD each when we got back, I didn’t want to have psychedelics so I had a second MDMA cap. When we got back to my sisters place , Mary  and Barbara lost an acid tab when we got there. Eventually we all gave up looking for it  and they all took a tab each. Not long after taking the tab it got kinda weird with her, her vibe changed  and she wasn’t talking much, we weren’t as ‘close’ physically as earlier (not cuddling n stuff) but we were holding hands? They were all waiting for the LSD to kick in  and everyone wasn’t really talking much, and cos I hadn’t taken a tab I wasn’t on the same ‘level’. I think that’s where things changed cos my 2nd MDMA cap was coming on while her tab was coming on so we were on different wavelengths. We were all chilling in the lounge room laying down for about an hour and it was pretty obvious Barbara was the 5th wheel. Mary, her friend  and my sister went into her room and were talking for awhile. Eventually they came out and we all went for a cigarette on the balcony and they basically came and said they were leaving. They were going to stay the night then an hour or two later after we got back they said they were leaving cos her friend wanted to be with her boyfriend. I was too out of it to leave the unit  and when I said ‘I’m too f*cked to leave when Mary asked me if I was coming she said 'well your ambitious’. Never has my gut dropped so much. Instant regret. Such a horrible feeling, intensified by the drugs. I’m sure they left cos they started feeling uncomfortable being there, particularly Marys friend being the 5th wheel without her BF on new years eve. My sister, her partner  and I all planned on coming back to their placed to end the night there regardless, a safe place to come back to. So we kind of all had it in our head that we weren’t leaving after we got back. Looking back I wish I went back with Mary  and her friend but it probably wasn’t the best idea because they ended up taking another tab and ‘day-tripped’. Which could have ended up quite messy since it was pretty messy after they left anyway just being with my sister n her partner. Who knows what would happened - I never will know cos I chose not to go. I told my sister n her partner the next morning what Mary said when she left  and I asked them if I screwed up by not going back with her - my sisters husband said yeah i thought I heard her say something like that but my sister sort of dismissed it. They were both pretty adamant that I hadn’t ‘fucked up’ though - the next day my sister said she spoke to Mary on FB and asked her about what she said before she left that night  and she said that she didn't say that at all, something like 'oh alright then' was what she apparently said but I didn't really believe it. Mary sent me a message first on snapchat a couple days after new years basically saying ‘hey was nice to meet you had a nice time  and we said we should chill n have a sesh sometime’ etc. So we started talking a little bit, went to buy weed from their place a day later  and added her on FB but didn’t ask for her number. Such an idiot. Anyway, It was my sisters birthday the first week of 2017  and she had a party the first weekend (7th Jan - Saturday), Mary  and I were both going so we were going to catch up there. I was talking to her leading up to my sisters bday party after i came home on the Thursday and then the next night I had a panic attack after smoking some weed (happened cos of repressed emotions from traumatic domestic event in late 2016)  and went to the doctor the next morning for a referral to a psychologist along with some sort of temporary medication to help me sleep  and I haven't spoken to her since. And with all my anxiety i'm afraid to even talk to her because its been over a month and she probably thinks I’m a rude douchebag but then again she may not even think twice about it. My sister said she knows I have a lot going on in my life at the moment so she probably doesn’t mind. I felt like I got attached to her way too quickly after that night, or perhaps attached to the idea of potentially being with someone? Since it had been so long since I’ve actually had that physical connection with someone it was quite difficult to just ‘let go’ and forget about it. I became afraid of this attachment and decided to stop talking to her to detach myself, I didn’t want to come across as needy or obsessive. Couldn’t stop thinking about her for 2 weeks afterwards. Avoiding talking to her ended up making me think of her more. She hasn’t messaged me since I didn’t reply to her last message so as far as she’s concerned she may not even think about me at all? When I was younger I used to talk to girls day  and night (not exactly proud of it) but my point is I had confidence, I wasn't anxious or insecure - like I’m too afraid to even message Mary? I just feel awkward after hooking up with her, when I went to her place  and added her on FB I was so awkward around her, didn’t know how to act around her after hooking up  and being so f*cked from the drugs lol - I just want to be able to talk to her and get to know her,  and i don’t really feel like getting to know her through text is how I want to do it either, I’d rather do it in person. But then I’m awkward in person after hooking up lol, don’t how to be. Don’t know what to do, she keeps popping in my head. Feel like I’m not worthy enough, not enough self worth  and confidence. No job, no car, no license, no friends, what do I have to offer? I lift weights, I’m fit, I’m healthy, I’m intelligent, I’m educated, own my own business, I feel like I’m attractive - definitely not ugly, but can barely bring myself to message her on Facebook. Am I just mentally stuck on this whole thing? Do I need to let it go  and move on? I know the next move would be to reach out to her again  and eventually ask to meet up in person  and go from there. But my social anxiety is stopping me. I feel like there is a lot that has gone unsaid between us that should be spoken about  and idk if thats me overthinking it but I don’t even know how to bring that up to her either. I feel so weird thinking all of this when I barely know her. I just don’t know what to do, or how to ask her how she feels about the whole thing cos apparently she got out of a year long relationship herself  and according to my sister ‘she probably isn’t looking for anything’. So as far as Mary is concerned it may have just been a one time thing to hook up on New Years; I don’t know her well enough to make that judgement and don’t feel comfortable enough to talk to my sister about it anymore cos I told her about getting attached and she made me feel like a complete idiot for being like that. Idk if it was because I was on MDMA (I know it dissolves boundaries  and you generally have a better connection with other people, the ‘love drug’, very euphoric) but I was drawn to her in a way I have never experienced before (before taking the MDMA), normally I'm sexually attracted to girls like yeah I find her attractive but that's not what drew me too her - idk how to explain it. Like a deeper connection? I don’t want to say like a soul mate, but I’ve never felt a connection like this with a person before? But then again it could be a superficial connection with the drugs. I really have no idea! Any opinions/advice/guidance would seriously be appreciated so much! I have no one to talk to about this. I got about a 1/3 way through the story with my psychologist in todays session  and it’s just eating me up inside! I want to get out of this mental rut!

            "{'sequence': '(\\'Up  and Out, Not Down  and In. Over the more than 20 years that I battled social anxiety before finally overcoming it, I developed the concept of “up and out, not down and down and in”. This sounds simple but it was incredibly effective. It was a little reminder I would give myself that I applied specifically to my gaze and body language in order to turn around any situation where I could feel myself becoming very socially anxious and potentially losing control and spiralling into a full-blown anxiety attack or “episode”. Having had SA for most of my life, I developed a very intimate relationship with it and one of the most interesting things I noticed about it, was that it has most power when not faced - either figuratively or literally. I found it was most potent when left to wreak havoc in that space just out of the corner of your eye or mind’s eye. That couple you can kind of see out of the corner of your eye in the coffee shop and can hear laughing, but are too anxious to turn to look at - you just \"know\" they are laughing at you. You start to feel awkward and you become certain they are giggling more at how conspicuously uncomfortable you are becoming. The book you were originally reading, you are now only using as a prop as a place to fix your eyes. You can feel your thoughts starting to race and feel yourself spiralling towards an anxiety attack. You just \"know\" they can see your excruciating awkwardness and your redness and sweating starting to build, and are delighting in it with those shrill laughs. That person you see coming towards you on the pavement. You’ve only taken a quick glance from 30 yards away, but you can just immediately \"tell\" that it’s that person that used to bully you at school. Your heart explodes and you start to feel it pumping in your neck - not just your chest. You feel sick from the adrenaline. Your head drops, your shoulders round over. Pull out your phone and pretend to take a call so you can turn around? Cross the street? Look at the ground, look at the ground, walk as fast as you can. Let’s just get through this. Why the hell does this kind of stuff always happen to me? Any of this sound familiar? In these (perceived) stressful situations your gaze drops submissively downwards, your attention turns inwards to your own racing thoughts and heartbeat, and your body begins to curl up into a defensive ball - shoulders come up to the ears as if to protect yourself from an imminent blow, arms fold across the chest and the head drops. It was at exactly such moments that I would remind myself of “up and out, not down and in”. As I felt my body and thoughts being crushed by the weight of what I believed was happening around me in situations like those above, I would deliberately push back against it. I would bring my head and gaze up, sit upright, take a deep breath and stretch as if I was uncomfortable from sitting too long, push out my chest and turn my awareness outwards. As I stretched, as if yawning, I would take a good look around the room. And when I did, I found something incredible happened... I found that these nightmare-ish scenarios that I thought were unfolding around me existed as mere phantoms in the corner of my eye and mind’s eye - in my physical and mental peripheral vision as it were. When I turned to look at what was really happening it was as if the scales fell from my eyes and I was awoken from a bad dream. Where I imagined terrible demons looming up, there were only pleasant everyday people, going about their lives. The couple in the coffee shop were a pair of young lovers, so into each other and canoodling so much they hadn’t even noticed me, let alone given a f*ck about what I was doing. The guy walking toward me on the pavement wasn’t that guy from school 20 years ago. I had just managed to project my worst fears onto him and make his face morph into someone else. Amy Cuddy has talked at length about the link between posture and mind, and I find that this “making myself big” brings about an immediate change in me mentally. It is effectively a way of striking a “power pose” and this change in physical state brings about a change in the mind and body - even changing hormone levels! It’s as if I am physically throwing off the pressure which I had been allowing to build up on me, which in turn was shrinking my posture down physically into a weaker and more submissive pose. This then becomes a downward spiral as submissive body language feeds into ever more negative thoughts...and on and on. As I look around the room in such instances or face the person I was worried about, I turn myself from a feeling of the passively observed to potent observer. The gaze is a very powerful thing and can be used very effectively in dealing with social anxiety. In the coffee shop example, as I look around, I see normal people doing their own thing - reading books, listening to podcasts, scrolling through their phones - not the rows of judging faces pointing and laughing at me that I had let build up in my mind’s eye. This technique can be used in any anxiety-inducing situation where you have enough space to avoid yourself shrinking down under the weight of your anxious thoughts. Even if speaking in public or another situation where you feel scrutinised and unable to make exaggerated movements there are still changes you can make to bring about the same effect. For example, if speaking in public you can strike a power pose by widening your stance, leaning forward with both hands on the lectern and bringing your chin up. You can also scan the room to engage people individually with eye contact. In this way, the blurry sea of judgemental “audience” “out there”, becomes individuals with their own features and expressions. I also use it a lot on buses, trains and airplanes where I would find walking past rows and rows of seated passengers while I looked for a seat very stressful. But I find this is most effective on the subway, which i historically found a very stressful and anxiety-inducing environment. The more I would be sucked down into looking at my phone or book (which i was only pretending to engage with because I was becoming anxious - and increasingly so the more I believed people were starting to notice how uncomfortable I was) the more my thoughts would race, the redder I would get and the greater the feeling of losing control and spinning into an anxiety attack was.The spell could only be broken by “up and out, not down and down and in” - looking up, posturing up and turning my attention outwards. On subway trains now I spend a lot of the time enjoying the luxury of leisurely looking around the carriages. I try not to stare at anyone as I’m sure there are many people there with their own self-consciousness and anxiety issues that don’t want any unwarranted excessive attention. But I do enjoy the newfound ability to let my gaze roam around, register people’s faces and see that no one is out to get me or laugh at me or judge me.

I used to not make any eye contact with anyone outside and when I would come home, I would feel horrible and start to kick myself because of it. I would feel like I was missing out on life and would feel sad. I broke this habit by telling myself before going outside, \" some eye contact, even if it\\'s awkward, is better than no eye contact.\" For girls, I notice that when a cute girl comes into my line of sight I get nervous and shy away. I would look anywhere expect for them. This has been a automatic reaction for awhile, and I would feel like coward afterwards. I manually had to change this behavior. So before going outside I\\'ll tell myself \" Some eye contact with girls, is better than no eye contact.\" Last tip I can give is posture. I imagine my back against a wall when I am walking.

My friend was there with her bf and her other friend. We got along rather well. Sure enough the 4 of us got bored and went to do our own thing.

I dunno what was going through my mind (other than alco) but i did find her cute (she was indian or similar) we grinded a little as well and kept saying stupid things to one another about the place and i kept making sure not to charge across her boundaries but also break the touch barrier.. we held hands while dancing heaps. my two other friends left early and i took this chance to ask her to go for a walk.. sure enough we did and we ate shitty fast food on the way back to where ahe was staying.. at the top of the stairs i had to give her back her shoes (i was carrying them because they hurt her feet) i asked her if she wanted her shoes back and she said \"maybe, is that what you want?\" i said \"idk maybe its not\" she said \"maybe you want something else\" i said \"maybe i do\" we smiled and she leant in for a kiss snd i met it. We made out for a little bit and i said \"thats more like it\" we did it again and i hugged her around her lower back.. i told her that was my first kiss and she was kinda shocked.. then she told me hers and how it was weird.

The only thing the psychiatry helped me is to not to overthink so much like ''what random strangers might think about me when i walk past them'' so yeah, that's 1 good thing. But the other thing pisses me of so much.... i. can't. fucking. talk. I never talked to my parents, i never talked to anyone, seven hells, even my psychiatrist knows more about me in 3 meetings than my parents for 20 years and i'm barely able to talk to her, 'cause i don't know what the fuck to say, i have nothing to say, my interests are space, history, really old stuff no one knows shit about or doesn't care. Other than that i play games the entire day or watch movies... But nothing interesting to talk about with others at my age... Soo. I can't hold a conversation at all, i can't start it and things get weird pretty quickly. I guess that's what most of us get through. So how do i break it? My only motivation? lmao, i am pathetic. My only motivation to change is because of another girl that works at the psychiatry as a student and i, well, how can i say this? seems like i got a fucking crush on her and it makes things WORSE. I've been trying to act normal around her which works surprisingly good, my self control is at 100%. But i still can't talk, i just want to talk to her, she is so fucking nice and i don't want to mess it up...Things got worse, now i don't want to be alone anymore AND don't want to be around people, this shit fucked everything up even more for me... I get so fucking nervous when i try to talk...I always say to myself ''why can't you be normal? none of this shit matters, if you don't talk to her you will never see her again after you get out of the psychiatry so just fucking talk, next time you see her say ''hello'' and be done with it'' i go back immediatly to do it but then i freeze up the moment i see her and can't open my mouth because the fear is literally eating up my ass.

I know even if I went out drinking/ clubbing I would not find the kind of person I would want to be around at all.

As part of a New Years resolution, I decided I was going to start saying yes to events instead of being cozied up at home all the time. I should note that I’ve been homeschooled through K-12, hence never having walked in a classroom. I won’t lie, I was really nervous leading up to, and partly during the event. I played some indie folk music on the way to try to soothe my nerves. As soon as I pull my car over the hill with the intersection, I witnessed just what I’d be getting myself into. Cars were everywhere. It was a real turn out. There were over 200 people in attendance. I find a parking spot at another building, and I’m just thinking of home. Home where I don’t have to worry about sounding stupid or accidentally having a social faux pas. I push out my chest and walk towards the line. I wasn’t expecting a line. So I mozy on to the back of the line, occasionally looking at my phone so I would blend in with most of the high school kids that were there (I’m 19 with a full beard who is out of the loop on current technology). I couldn’t get a WiFi connection, so I was just switching between settings and the browser the whole time, hopefully looking like I was doing something. The line crawls, and I’m just switching between looking up and at my phone. I make it to the walk up registration, and tell them my name and what not. It seems like it went ok. I walked up and just found the quickest seat I could so I wouldn’t have to be seen walking up by everyone. I sit down and immediately this dude asks if I play vidya games. So I tell him I play fortnite. He starts asking if I watch this particular twitch streamer, I say no. The conversation kind of fizzles out after. Wondering if I seemed boring? Moments later I hear him say to one of his friends “you want to get drunk later?”. At that moment I’m having a little bit of a culture shock. I’ve never drank alcohol. Does everyone booze in HS? I felt kind of uncomfortable. Finally the presentation begins. It’s pretty basic, and I could have got more information from the website. There is a point during the presentation where they play this website quiz game from the school. I can’t partake because my WiFi won’t work, so I just watch the results. I would have got most of them wrong if I tried. Yikes. I was taking notes, but not paying attention to the right stuff evidently. So after that, the whole room is being split off into tour groups. I am paying full attention because I don’t want to screw up and go off with the wrong group. Thankfully I do get the right one. At this point I’m standing alone with a bunch of strangers. Most are with someone else. The tour seems to go fine, there were these three really obnoxious teenagers who were fucking off for the most part though. They didn’t bother me thankfully. Our tour ends and it’s on to the last event (which I wasn’t aware of until later.) Its basically a few different stands promoting different fields of study and social events (almost none of which pertained to my major of choice or my personal interests.) I talk to a few of them anyways. I won’t lie, it was really awkward. I kept tripping over my words, speaking in broken English, and my mind went completely blank a few times while in the middle of conversations. I honestly wonder if this hurt my chances of being enrolled. I didn’t have many good questions either. Afterwards I sat at a table and fidgeted on my phone, then I realized it was for the most part over, and a wave of calm came over me. I realized I could leave! Since I didn’t have anyone to talk to, what was the point of staying any longer? So I walked a long walk back to my car and headed home. That was it. Only part worth it was touring the campus honestly. Well it wasn’t a perfect attempt at integrating into society, but it’s progress nonetheless. I’m proud that I did this instead of wondering what it would have been like at home. It was awkward and I didn’t connect with anyone. I’m afraid more will follow when I do (eventually) enroll there. I just thought I’d share his with anyone of you who is afraid of getting out of the house and in public. I still feel like an out of touch geriatric alien, but hopefully I made some progress. **TL;DR** Went to a preview day at my local community college.

Hopefully someone will read through and offer some advice or likeness. Okay, so I have been someone who suffers from social anxiety since I was about 8. Before that I was actually very outgoing and was social at my preschool/first grade/second grade. Many things contributed to my social anxiety and thus my life long battle of depression. The first notable thing was my teachers bullying me for having ADHD and telling me I was too disruptive. The second notable thing was my best friend in second grade ended up ignoring me because the popular girl in the class disliked me as I was very active and bubbly. So, that\\'s some backstory, and ever since then I have been an internet recluse. Everytime I tried to make friends they used me and then bullied me verbally and mentally until at 13 I quit going to school and outside completely. Internet gaming, specifically MMOs is all I\\'ve had since. Fast forward, I am now nearing 22. I go to college, have a job, and a boyfriend of nearly 5 years. Everything on that aspect is fine (or better than expected for now) but...I fucked myself over socially. When I was 16 I made a friend group despite my social anxiety. The internet is easier to socialize on for me, even though I still can\\'t order a pizza over the phone or make a Dr. Appointment irl. I\\'ve had these friends since 16 for a very stable period, but last year I had a complete social anxiety attack and went haywire. I removed everyone, blocked them, and vanished for 2 months. I tried to come back and explain what happened, but no one was having it. One friend who was very close, even responded \"lol good\" when she heard I was struggling. I tried to reach out people to ask why I was being treated this way and they would get mad at each other for telling me something and then I got backlash for trying to reconnect and put the pieces of my social life back together. This has been extremely debilitating for me and I have relapsed to my pre-social ways. I apologized and told them I\\'d stop bothering them, to which they never responded to except that they didn\\'t need the drama. What bothers me most is that to make these friends, I put myself out there and listened to when THEY were upset. I specifically remember two of them were genuinely suicidal and I talked them through their troubles. One of them said she won\\'t speak to me because I am only trying to talk to her because no one else will and I need someone. Well....yeah. Is this not what normal friends do? Anyways, I apologized to them all and removed them because I was only a bother and annoying. I keep having small breakdowns and it\\'s leaking out in my relationship and work. Today at work the assistant manager seen me act very atypical and asked me if I was okay to which I kind of laughed in a hollow tone and said no and walked away.

Has anyone else experienced this and has found a way to cope or just experienced this in general? I want to make new friends...but I just feel like a teen again and like everyone hates me.

Im 16, male, suffer from GAD since I was 3 yo got diagnosed with it when I was 8 or 9. This past summer I saw many changes with my behaviour and thought they were normal, because of puberty and such. Now Im sure it isnt just puberty. Today I went to the store to buy a new pair of earbuds, mine broke and listening to music helps with my anxiety. I was on foot and during the 7 mimute walk to the store I was starting to get sweaty, I was thinking what to say to shop assistant and I was afraid of someone recognising me and I had to make a small talk with them. I get to the store, a big one inside a mall. I get there and the first thing I see were the earbuds, but they werent those that I wanted, searched and couldnt find the earbuds that I wanted, I wanted to get as quickly as possible so I grabbed one of those and headed towards the counter to buy them. The shop assistant was talking to 2 women and I was afraid of interrupting them, I give the earbuds to another shop assistant that was next to the other shop assistant that was talking to the women. He was doing something else but I put the earbuds on top of the counter without saying anything, the guy saw that I wanted to buy the ear buds and gave them to the lady that was talking to the women. The woman was slowlying writting on the keyboard with 2 fingers and talking to the women, during this, I was sweating and shaking, and I was looking at the store, I saw the earbuds that I wanted on my right and I had missed them when I was first looking for the earbuds. I take one of the earbuds and placed them on top of the counter, the shop assistant didnt see the earbuds that I wanted on top of the counter, I had to talk to the shop assistant that I wanted to change the product, few words, was quick and quiet while shaking and sweating. She did what she had to do and I took the money out of my wallet shaking to give the lady. I put them in my backpack and walk, almost running to home thinking that I was way too akward and that they saw me shaking and sweating, got home and started writting this. I go the shrink about my GAD but never mentioned my anxiety while on these situations. Im too afraid, my parents judge me for not hangging out much with my peers, they compare me to them when they were my age and I sometimes get grounded because they think that I am additcted to my pc and phone, which I am not, and that addiction is making me hang out less with my friends. My shrink knows my parents really well, she was my dad's shrink for when he had depression, it was on that time that I was diagnosed with GAD. At the end of each session my shrink talks to my dad or my mom about the session amd Im afraid my parents will judge me after the session, at home. What should I do?

            "{'sequence': '(\\'Everyone hates me and what I\\'ve learned from it. This is going to be a weird post and hopefully it fits here well. I never thought of this as a social anxiety, but it actually is kind of, correct me if I\\'m wrong I\\'m new to Reddit. I\\'ve been hated. Even since preschool. Not by my family by all means, and people liked members of my family by the way. It seemed like people only outside of my family hated me. Strangers, classmates, coworkers, anyone I came into contact with besides my family hates me. I was always the quiet one and the weird one. I never minded either. I fed off of their hate. Anytime I got bullied I would fight back. Like you know when they say fight or flight? Yea I was the fighter. I would lash out and do exactly what they did to me. Or I would cry and show them exactly how it made me feel right then and there, almost as a joke but filled with rage. I didn\\'t really get embarrassed. I was really good at doing embarrassing things and be okay with it most of the time. I preferred to be alone. I never liked it When people tried to become my friend. Like why are you texting me and calling me? Please leave me alone. For some reason I did actually become friends with the other unliked kid. I would see people snicker at them and see them as weird. Here\\'s a little story: There was one girl in middle school. Her name was Jane. She had long black hair, pale skin and bright hazel eyes. The kids were literally afraid of her and thought she was weird I wasn\\'t afraid of her and I was fascinated in her. I also felt empathy for her. I could relate to her of being unliked. End of short story. Weird part about enjoying being alone is I\\'ve always had a boyfriend since the beginning of high school. The boyfriends were always cool and well liked by others. The boyfriends were all similar in their own ways, we all broke up mutually, calmly and on good terms. The boyfriends all gave me respect, friendship and trust. The cool boys always liked Jane as well and she always had a cool boyfriend too! Other boys thought we were the \"funniest, raddest, coolest, best to be around\" chicks out there. Or so they say. So I guess what I should have said in the beginning of this entire post is, most girls hate me. So truth be told, not everyone hates me. This has been a lie for my whole life. I believed as a small child up until early adulthood is that everyone hated me was far from the truth. One day I had enough. I tried to kill myself. Slit my wrists and wanted to bleed out. Well it didn\\'t work, I didn\\'t die and I should have gotten stitches. So I decided that day I will never try again left with awful scars. I still hated my life and the fact everyone hated me. I fell again in these ideas I created. Sure there was hard proof for people hating me. They hated the way I looked, the way I dressed, my hair. They spread rumors, they prank phone called me, tried to best me up. I had a girl send me a 10 page text message saying I lie about every story I ever told her . The words this girl said to me hurt me deeply. I cried and cried. I worked with her and I had to face her. I was terrified of her and I wondered \"why me\" It was a pattern. Some girls simply just didn\\'t like me. There was nothing I could say or do any differently. You might be thinking, \"there has got to be a reason why people hate me.\" The only thing I can think of to answer that thought, would be that I am totally myself. I don\\'t sugar coat shit. I\\'m honest and I like to share ideas and past expieriances. So here is a little description about me to paint a better picture. I try hard with things I do. I really enjoy practicing different skills and hobbies that strike my interest suddenly such as painting, playing instruments, gymnastics, yoga, hiking, biking, dog training, cooking, singing and more. If something interests me I try it. You could say I\\'m a go getter. At the same time I\\'m laid back, I\\'m quiet and a keep to myself person. Other times I am wacky and weird. I sing and dance to myself, I talk to myself. I do weird things. I make jokes and I laugh at things. I am over the spectrum of things. I am ever changing. I am confused but I am aware. I am always looking around me and thinking people are planning things. I avoid people. Other times I truely care about people. I love people and I love seeing their talents. I want to get to know them and I listen to them. I always see people and notice their intentions. You could say I am observant. But all of this I still enjoy being alone. I guess I live a balanced life. I\\'m also a Libra and my life seems to match up to those horoscopes most of the time to also paint a picture of myself. So instead of rambling on and on and on as I\\'m surprised if anyone is even still reading this, I\\'m going to get straight to the point. I\\'ve learned a lesson in life and it is difficult to grasp!! The lesson is, no one actually truely cared about me all along but myself. It was me all along that cared too much about what people thought. It was my reactions towards situations that hurt me and made me think people hate me. I have to come to terms that I am simply an imperfect human being with odd characteristics as everyone else! We are all so unique and in our own little worlds. We all work differently and that\\'s how we all fit together just as a puzzle and how each piece is unique and all work together. Sometimes it takes a while for the pieces to come together and sometimes they seem to fit but they don\\'t really work well and you can\\'t actually fit them perfectly. Sometimes different pieces in the puzzle need to be as far away as possibly to work perfect and help complete the picture. It is okay to not get along with everyone but when they show their dislike I need to keep calm and carry on. What I mean by our own little worlds is, everything around us is determined by our own judgements and the way we see things around us. We all see things differently, our brains work differently and you can clearly see we are all different so that proves our own little worlds. We all automatically look out for our own well being. So my whole life I was thinking too hard about what people thought of me. Once someone expressed their slight 2 second care about me, my reaction made me believe that everyone hated me. It was a delusion. I had a chain reaction because once I believed everyone hates me my actions and reactions more than likely changed that held characteristics that are easy to dislike by other people. Hopefully out of all of this rambling is that I can continue to realize these thoughts of mine and start to have a better attitude towards life. I hope I can bring light and new helpful ideas to the world. I strive to be the best I can for myself and others. I will react to others even when they do me wrong as a calm and collected individual. I will handle my fight instinct as a normal human in complete control. I will continue to just be myself and let others be themselves.\\')', 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with positive effect', 'outdoor activity or space with negative effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect'], 'scores': [0.34561285376548767, 0.33079764246940613, 0.3235894739627838]}\n",

Tuesday I left my house with the intent of going but about midway through I just started panicking and instead walked around the city so my family didn\\'t start suspecting of anything. I swear I never walked as much a I did that day it was pathetic, and all because I\\'m afraid to go to class. That was when I decided that I wouldn\\'t go at all that week and instead I\\'d prepare myself and today I\\'d be in a changed man an all the fear and anxiety would be gone. Late night Sunday the same disgusting feeling started going on again. Heart racing, this awful feeling on my stomach where you are completely comfortable on your couch yet it feels like something isn\\'t right...

In high school I had 2-3 really close friends including my main best friend lets call her BFF, and a bunch of other friends mainly just people I talked to and hung with in school and class but was never truly close with. So my bff and I were super close all of high school until about the end of march when she basically ditched me for a new group of friends she made. We would still talk and I was her “best friend” but once she started hanging out with her new friend group she never included me, stopped telling me about important thing going on in her life, etc and overall just acting really snobby and conceited. I ended up confessing to one of the other girls I was really close with what was happening, and she was by my side and supported me. My bff and I ended up talking everything through and were good but things didn’t really change. She kept hanging out with them at all times never including me and when I did hang with them (once) she barely spoke to me the entire time. After we graduated she had two weeks in our city before she had to go away and start summer semester at a college far away but still in the same state. She spent the whole two with her new friend group and only gave me one day to hang out 3 days before she had to leave. During this time I was at my dad’s house and was so pissed that she would do this to me that I was not going to leave my dads house just so she could see me when she had all this time to and didn’t. Summer goes along and we didn’t talk not even once. At this point in my life I had decided to start school in the spring to give myself some time because I felt that I needed it and my only two friends were the girl that helped me out with my bff and her best friend who was also my friend. The entire summer we barely hung out. After summer we hung out a couple times but they were all super boring. I’m personally very outgoing and a hyped up type of person when I’m around people I feel comfortable with. They would just sit there and not want to do anything fun or engaging. I don’t mean get drunk and party all night, but like go makeup shopping or play fun stupid games, go out to eat, talk about boys, go shopping, go to the beach, or in general anything besides like going to one of their houses and playing nintendo wii. Plus on top off all this they were very judgy and would look at me weird for saying something outside of the box. When I would ask one of them about the boys in the college I was going to go to in the spring she would be dry and uninterested. Then in October I got a job, and I really like the place I work at. When we would hang out and I would try to tell them about the people and like the tea going on at work they didn’t care and I would talk and they didn’t respond and I felt like I was talking to my self. All of this plus the fact that since they were each others best friend they wouldn’t include me in a lot of their convos and then bring up things when I was there made me feel really lonely and tired. Eventually was broke the camels back was that drama basically started again with my bff and when I texted them I was just going to text her and end this once and for all they both started sending messages like “oooohhh can’t wait for the tea” or “🐸☕️”, “the tea it hot” and in general things like that. I was so offended because instead of being there for me and supporting me bc they both knew how hurt and emotionally affected I was from the situation between my bff and I all they cared about was the tea and the drama. A month after this happened I cut them off but only talked to one of them. It was the one that helped me in the beginning with my bff. I thanked her for supporting and that I was always going to be grateful for that but that our friend ship was over and I explained to her how they made me feel and basically she texted me back cursing me out and saying a whole bunch of rude shit and I never texted her again. Both of them blocked me on all social media platforms and I have not seen, heard, or talked to them since that day. I started college but online bc I have no transportation to campus so I have no interactions with people my own age and at my job it’s mainly middle aged women and a few young people but not anyone I consider to have a good connection friendship wise with. It gets me so sad to see my ex bff on social media going to parties and having fun, making friends, etc. when I wish I was doing that. Plus just in general watching young people my age having fun and hanging out with their “squad” makes me depressed! Because I want that. Now because of my friendless life and because I have little to no interaction with people my own age in over a year I’m beyond scared to do school on campus so I’ve decided to do all of college online. I’ve definitely gotten a lot anxiety in regards to being social with people my own age and also boys. I’ve never had a boyfriend or even talked to anyone and with my whole lonely no friends no social life situation I’m never going to meet one and if I do, I mentally I’ve already sabotaged myself because I think to myself how embarrassing it would be to meet a boy and when he asks about my friend me tell him that I have none. Like how fucking embarrassing and lame does that sound. So to avoid this Im just not gonna let any potential guy get close enough. Plus I’m insecure about my body bc Im a little chubby but don’t do anything to change this because I have zero motivation. So far the only good things going for me are my job, school, and my immediate family. I get depressed when I think about the fact that I’m so young and I have no friends anyone to hangout with and have normal social interactions with. Like am I really going to waste all of my young years stuck in my house all day and working as much as possible.

I have a specific friend who my attention has been on lately because he really doesn't talk that much to me, almost forgot to say hello to me when he arrived to this party (even though that's probably not true, alot of people there to say hello to) I know for a fact that this is like the nicest guy that exist in the world, but my brain is a wierdo so.. Should also add that he is a few steps above acquaintance level. There had been some quite heavily alcohol intake from everyone at this party and sometime during the night me and a friend decide to take a walk around the neighborhood and he decides to come with. I tell my friend about this feeling about him hating me (2nd time, have talked about it before and she says that's not the case). This situation ends up with me deciding it's a great time to tell him how I feel. My friend ends up telling him that I feel this way with my permission (He also doesn't know I have anxiety or any problems btw). He then comes over and of course tells me that's absolutely not the case. I suddenly break down crying and hyperventilating in his arms and we talk it out as best we can (we are alone at this stage). My friend then gets back and in my drunk state I pretty much word vomit out a confusing summary of my history with anxiety and my current state to them. We keep on walking the three of us and he keep comforting me with kind words, small hugs and back touches until we arrive back at the party with me now close to anxiety free. I'm now a little confused about this. I'm honestly glad I told him, it feels like it got rid a little bit of the whole thought about people hating me. I also feel guilty that I brought another person in to my anxiety. I sent him a message this morning apologising about that he had to see that and that I put him in this position, and he said everything was cool and I believe him. I honestly thought I would have more anxiety about this but a big part of me just laughs at this whole situation which is wierd. So this is just a little bit of a vent from a hungover girl.

Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been super shy. I don’t know why. Nothing happened to me as a child, I have a great family and have great friends so I don’t know why I have this debilitating issue. I looked it up, and i learned that sometimes people with an overactive amygdala have a heightened fight or Flight response therefore causing more severe anxiety. So maybe it’s a biological thing for me, but I have thought of anything at all that could have affected me to be like this but nothing comes to mind. Throughout middle school, I haven’t even realized but In seventh grade I was depressed. I don’t think I knew it. I knew I was sad but didn’t know if it went further than that. I don’t remember being suicidal then, but seventh grade was the first time I started to self harm. I was always getting in trouble with my parents, I’ve always felt like they’re out to get me and I never show or receive any affection. Because of this, me and my parents relationships is not the best. and I know it’s my fault. They try to understand why I act certain ways but I don’t even know myself. I wish I had an answer. So anyway, an incident happened in seventh grade where I had to share something with the class. Presentations always scared me and being in front of the class always did. Even if it was a simple yes or no question. I can’t stand being the center of attention and I always cry when I feel this social anxiety coming on. We had to share poems we had written and I just remember being so scared, I just started crying and couldn’t get through it. I remember my classmates faces and they were so confused and I was confused to. I knew it was just a presentation but my body had another idea. To this day I’m not sure if that was my first anxiety attack? and I’m not sure if I’ve ever had an anxiety attack because I never feel like the world is ending I just get so embarrassed I think, that all I can do is cry and my heart starts beating rapidly, and I’m shaking and I just wanna disappear. But do people have anxiety attacks differently? If you know, please help. Anyway, after that happened I was SO mortified I didn’t even want to go back to school. I always assumed people labeled me as the super shy freak girl and wouldn’t want to talk to me anyway so I decided to do virtual school in eighth grade. No one knows that’s the reason I decided to be homeschooled. I just tell everyone “I don’t know just felt like it” when they ask because I don’t want to tell them my embarrassing story. So virtual school actually turned out to be awful and so I ended up starting high school for 9th grade as a freshman. Because I skipped out on 8th grade, I already didn’t have many friends. And the ones I did have, lets call her Lauren. She was my absolute best friend and we ended up having a class together so that was the class I looked forward to. I remember always being isolated in my other classes while everyone else talked and I would be so scared around people and scared that someone would talk to me. I didn’t have many friends that year. I also repeatedly cut and I was developing an addiction. Come sophomore year, I was deeply depressed. My best friend, still Lauren, she glew up. She became popular and gorgeous and it was hard being friends with her sometimes because she had so many friends and guys all over her. I know it wasn’t her fault of course, and through it all she stuck by me and I couldn’t be more grateful to have someone like her to this day. But I can’t Help but feel inferior when I’m with her sometimes. I would always think “people are probably wondering why she’s friends with you” “they just think you’re a charity case” I was so quiet all the time. I honestly don’t remember much of sophomore year. I just remember being sad all the time. I remember drawing sad sketches. I discovered and became obsessed with twenty One pilots, (still my favorite band today and I’m seeing them this year FLOOR TICKETS! can’t wait haha.) so come junior year, I told myself if I wasn’t happier by the end of the year I would kill myself before senior year. I met my other best friend junior year and we are so similar it’s crazy. So greatful for her friendship. Still struggled with self harm. I started to maybe get a little better, or so I thought I was. I got my first job at Burger King, which was not the wisest decision. Smoked weed and got high for the first time. Developed a huge crush on a boy who did nothing but lead me on. It really wrecked me and I don’t think he has any idea of how much to this day. Pierced my nose. I think I kept trying new experiences to feel something, convince myself to stay. I thought it was working but deep down, I was the same. Didn’t self harm as much because it wasn’t as easy to hide anymore. And my mom found out a little later and everything just got a bit crazy. Forced into therapy and parents found a pipe and new I was smoking. They were absolutely furious. I also was caught with a boy over at like 2 am by my mom. Not my finest moment. I think this was definitely my most impulsive year. I started to do things that scared me and that I knew was wrong but I think I was just trying to fill the void I had. One night I decided I had enough and tried to overdose on vistaril. I remember feeling the effects of it and becoming super tired so I thought that was it. I went to bed peacefully. Well, spoiler, I woke up. I was so mad I hadn’t taken enough but I think I was also relieved. I read about liver damage and all that and I decided that if I was going to do it again, I would take enough so I wouldn’t end up in the hospital impaired all my life. So summer before senior year, my best friend, Lauren, invited me to a church camp. I’ve always been a Christian and such but never had a relationship with God. That camp was a turning point for me. I met so many people and developed so many friendships and it opened my eyes to a life I wanted to live. And for the first time, I felt like I had support. People who were there for me and like I had God. But my depression still didn’t go away. I was still sad. So so sad. One of the hardest things I’ve ever done, is opened up and told my feelings of depression and suicidal ideation to. One night at the camp, it was the last night and we were all in this big room sharing stories or just venting things we needed to get off of our chest. Telling people things we needed prayer for. I told everyone In that room, maybe 60 people, my plans of killing myself. How I was going to before senior year but that this camp changed my mind. And I could barely get through it without crying. After that, a lot of people came to hug me and tell me to stay strong and that they were there for me. It was an amazing and cool experience. But I started attending church with her and becoming stronger in my faith and I connecting with amazing people. I went to Guatemala in 2017 on a mission trip and it was an amazing experience. Everything was as good as could be. I just wanted to be done with High school and done with my past there. I was ready for college and what life had for me. I can’t believe it, but I was dare I say hopeful. I felt guilty for being anxious and depressed as a Christian though. It of course, was no where as near as bad as it was but I still woke up and felt that same emotionless i felt for so long and tiredness. Soon enough, I just accepted it. People think that because I have Jesus now that I’m okay. But inside I am still hurting and depressed. I think about suicide almost everyday but I would never act on it. I know God is there for me and would never want me to do this, his plans are always greater. And I believe that, I do. I went to Montreal on a mission trip this past November and it was awesome. I love helping people and showing gods love and although it’s hard to connect with people sometimes due to social anxiety, i know I’ll get through it. But still depression lingers. I worked at chick fil a for a bit but quit due to anxiety and the amount of people there and all. I try daily to get back up. I need a job but I’m scared to get one just to become over whelmed and quit again. I keep letting people down. I still want to die. I wish I could just go peacefully. I feel like a ghost among the living and I’ve always felt like something Is wrong with me. I’m on meds and I always dream of overdosing but I could never. I have a tattoo dedicated basically saying “this may suck but God’s still got you”. It’s “And if not, he is still good”. I got that tattoo and wrote my testimony about having social anxiety and living through it. I feel like a hypocrite for feeling like I want to die still. I always encourage others and tell them that it does get better and to hold on and I hope they believe me when I say it and can’t see behind my mask. I think I believe it when I say it to them. But for some reason my mind makes me believe that I will never succeed and I’m bound to live a purposeless life. Everyday I wake up and I say just another day to exist. Just doing my classes and occasionally meeting up with friends. I feel like I’m lying to them. No one knows how I feel am I’m ashamed to tell them. I don’t want them to take pity on me and I don’t want to treated like I’m going to break if they touch me. I am in a new relationship. My first boyfriend, and he is the sweetest most amazing thing. But I’m scared to tell him how I feel. I warned him of my depression and anxiety but I didn’t tell him the extent of it. He doesn’t know I self harm. Which I did for the first time in about 6 months yesterday. He saw and I told him it was the cat. Lame excuse and I don’t think he bought it. I’m torn between scared of telling him and him not wanting to deal with this or just tell him because he was going to leave anyway. either way I lose. it’s best to be honest right? Anyway. I know this is super long so thanks for reading if you did. Any comments / suggestions / advice is welcome. Thanks.

I will try to ´´summarize´´ this (at the bottom, there is a real summary). As a child, when i was around 11, i was really attractive to everyone. I know this because at school, i got all the girls chasing me, and so outside. Obviously, i was too young to ´´benefit´´ on this. At that age, i remember myself as an outgoing kid, that had friends and did some regular stuff. Later on, something happened. I think that the inflection point was the haircut that i started wearing, the classic mushroom haircut that a lot of kids wear...with the difference that i was a teenager already. From being a young Adonis, i started to hear the mock of some girls, through the nicknames that they put on me, refered to my haircut. All my friends started having some interactions with girls, while i was just staring, too afraid of rejection. That was the beginning of my fearful existence, and it continued (with ups and downs) until my current age of 25. So yeah, right now i feel like i didnt live at all. I never had a girlfriend, i only have 1 friend that i meet every few months, i never had a job and never been to a party. This decade has been a mix of playing World of Warcraft, doing sport (cycling and calisthenics, obv individual sports), and studying some random useless shit that my mother suggested me to. I feel like it doesnt matter what i study, since there is people in almost every single profession. Ive studied hostelry and quitted it cos its too customer-facing. Ive studied sport and physical activity animator...but it was only because i like to practice it, im too insecure for teaching or doing anything in fron of a group. Now i switched to programming...but seems that im too autistic even for the nerd-world, since the teacher already told me that i have to learn to participate more while working in a groupal project...but i just end up excluding myself. Sport is what saved me through all this time. When im at home, i cant stop thinking about the past and the future, and i listen a lot of depressing music. So i need to take a ride on my bike almost every day. Im prety good at it and its hard to think about random shit when you are under big physical effort. I consider myself a good interlocutor, but i only can show this in individual conversations. In a group (specially if i dont know the members), im unable to articulate a single word unless someone ask my oponion directly. This is hard for me, because everybody that ever meet me, told me that im a very witty person and i can contribute to the conversation. Im really quick at making word games. Somebody once told me that i should try rap battles. And i would...if i could articulate a fucking word in front of groups of strangers -.-º. Because of this witty personality, i know that people want me in their groups, and i got invited to random plans and parties many times...but always refused. I just cant stop thinking about little details that throw me back: what if i have to dance, what if they wanna take photos, what if my clothes are not suitable...And so, for me, saturday is just another weekday to play WoW and do some sport... I once challenged myselft to go to a psychologist. Since the first session was free and it was one to one conversation, i thought i had no excuse. It went pretty well, she got really interested in me, because we talked for an hour and a half (the session had one hour) and she even invited me to come for another free session and to pay whatever amount i could for the next ones. Not to vary, i rejected... As to relationships, ive always been on this dating webs, but it has been useless because my profile photos sucks. I hate being photographed, i dont want to recognize myself on the pics(i think im much better in person) .I always have the same 3 pics from a specific angle and blurry. I consider myself pretty good at flirting, but if the profile pic is not attractive, u wont get the chance to start a conversation. And so, i didnt meet a single girl this way. Well...i actually met one. It was on a social anxiety forum. We exchanged numbers. I could see her picture, but she couldnt see mine, so everything was ok xD. She was really pretty, which surprised me(even more, when i discovered that she had like 1k followers on IG). We chatted for a week straight, it was amazing. One day, she asked me to meet in real life, which is really hard for me, but after those conversations, i thought there was feeling between us, so i accepted. We met in a bar. She was really beautiful irl, but not as perfect as in those IG pics, which i liked even more. At first, we were kinda nervous, but the beer made its effect and we talked for hours.It was getting late and she suggested me to pass the night in my house. Im naive, but i think i know what this kind of proposition means...Still it was a terrible idea, cos i live with my mom. Dont know how and why, i ended up accepting. Before arriving to my house, i thorowed up(cos i smoked, and that makes me sick most of the times). Once in my house, my mom woke up...Well, we ended up sleeping on the same bed, but nothing could have happened cos i was too wasted X_X. Surprisingly, she wanted to keep meeting with me, and we met one more time, a few months later. The most remarkable about this one, is that we kissed. It was a really quick and cold experience, so i dont even consider it as i ever kissed. The fact that she kissed me (obv it was she who went for it) without passion, meant a lot for me. The next day, i told her to break up, because i was getting feelings, and she told me that she only was looking for friendship. She insisted in meeting again, but i rejected. That was the last time i had something with a girl, two years ago. And this is how i learned that u cant have social anxiety and 1k followers on IG by posting pics of your body. Ive cried a lot after that break up, and now im again on that numb state that everything is bad, but not enough to cry... How do i know that i have body dysmorphia. Simple: because im the supreme textrovert. I feel very secure when it comes to written comunication (more on my native language). I consider myself good at flirting (i know how to tease) and i use to troll a lot (even whole groups of people), specially the people that cry about their situation or blame others. Everything is ok as long as they dont see a picture of me. One really strange thing is that, in videogames, i never been able to speak through a microphone, which is a requirement for doing a lot of fun stuff. So i ended up being a loner even in videogames. Add that to my completism (im obsessed with achieving everything that is achievable in the games (and irl too)). Overall, i think i have a really great body, specially because i practiced several sports for more than ten years, Im 1.85 height, 70kg with very lean muscles and long legs. My hair is of an amazing quality and my haircut now is an upgraded version of the mushroom style that i think began everything xD. It makes me look younger. I dont like a lot of things about my face, but i think it has some personality. And down there, im slightly over the average. On the other hand, lets talk about what i dont like and what keeps me locked in this mental prison. I dont like my short arms, it makes me feel inferior in some sports (i feel like i have to be the best in everything). I actually started thinking that people with short arms are doomed, or something like that :/. I dont like my nose and how it looks when i smile (thats why i never smile in photos) I dont like how my hair looks when its wet, and the fordyce spots on my lips. I got the fordyce spots down there, too. They are harmless small white sebaceous bumps under the skin. Despite being well endowed, i focus more on the spots and the form of my D, which i dont like neither. Ive been watching porn for more than ten years, and it changes yourself physically and mentally. I cant stop comparing myself to the men that appear on the videos. I know almost everything about my conditions and my ´´flaws´´, because ive been reading shit about them for too long. The conclusion is that there is no magical solution, u just have to accept yourself. I read a lot about spirituality, too. Thats why i know that my goal in this life is to trascend this extreme identification with the body. To kill the ego, to live in the moment...but God, its been more than ten years and i didnt perceive much progress...I even know the techniques (meditation, self love affirmations, etc), but i end up thinking about the bad things. I still have hope, tho, and dont even contemplate suicide, because i would have to learn the lesson on the next life. Jesus, its tooking me the whole weekend to write this...with huge breaks, of course. Im such a perfectionist that i have to think a lot before before writing a line, then rewrite it...and i dont even like the final result. If you made it here: congratulations, you really deserve a prize xD! Here is the summary of this bible. I feel that i have a lot of amazing attributes, Physically im very fit because ive been practicing differen sports for more than ten years. Ive got a strong personality and witty sense of humor, as people say. Im good at flirting, too. But i just can show it. I isolate myself every time, reject invitations to social plans and let go a lot of chaces. I do this because im terrified of other peoples judgements, specially towards my body (in the supreme textrovert). Im very insecure sexually because of the classic fordyce spot issue. Now the real questions. Does anyone identify to this? Did anyone overcome a similar situation or have any advices? Do anyone wanna share his story?

Speaking of college, I have a bachelors degree in English (I know) I am currently unemployed and my last two jobs were in non profit academic advisory roles. I was pretty much a loner and hated school throughout life. I was taken to a therapist when i was 12, and they declared I was \"normal.\" I started questioning life in college and realized it was pretty useless and that it was school and work until you die. I drank liquor i would say the normal amount for a college student. After graduating, I took the two advisory jobs which I hated both jobs due to anxiety. I am not a people person in general and I would sweat profusely when talking to students or even in mildy hot temperatures. I sweat 10x more than others even in the winter. I would sweat in a crowded subway or platform or talking to new people. I spoke to a doctor and I was prescribed robinul and told I had hyperhydrosis. The robinul works so that part of my life is solved temporarily. In addition to this, no matter what allergy medicine I take or what dose, I drip water from my nose and eyes. If I go outside especially in the morning, and its sunny or windy, my eyes water. I get acid reflux and heartburn from tomato sauce, coffee and liquor (all things I love). I also find myself getting extremely angry at the simplest things (people walking slow in the city, etc, to the point where I think about attacking someone in my head.) When I began feeling suicidal at my first job after graduation, I spoke to a therapist again who once again told me I was \"normal\" a \"regular new yorker\". At this point I am at a wits end and speak to another doctor who prescribes me zoloft and other downers. I mix them with alcohol in a excessive amounts to cope with the job I hate. I stop taking the zoloft pretty because they didn\\'t work for me. I was taking to a hospital where people told me i was a handsome man who had things to live for and sat next to a girl with 16 cut marks on her arm and a guy who wanted to start fires with his hands. I did my research before hand and I realized that they would probably give me shock therapy (I don\\'t know how that would help) so I pretended to feel better. Fast forward to today, I am unemployed living off my parent. I work out about three or four times a week, I am about 5\\'11 195. The only problem is I have little to no appetite daily and I am starting to develop a belly. I eat maybe twice a day (where i force myself to eat),I sweat like Patrick Ewing in the fourth quarter if I don\\'t take robinul and i work out 4 times a week So this is unexplainable to me Anyway, I\\'ve had ultrasounds, endoscopy, colonscopy and the gastro doctor stated I was in perfect health and the only theory he has is ibs. As you can see, I\\'ve had a long series of issues in my body and doctors telling me everything is fine and blah blah etc. So I\\'m at a wit\\'s end. I also have gynecomastia in both nipples and it\\'s another obstacle that is annoying to deal with. I\\'m unemployed so I have no insurance to see any more doctors and i just think life is bullshit and I don\\'t want to deal with it. I have a girlfriend, who helps me want to keep living, although she keeps alluding to marriage in kids which I\\'m vehemently against. The only people that stop me from slicing my wrist\\'s are her, my mother, aunt, brother and 3 or 4 friends.

I created an action plan so I can break my journey down into manageable steps and the first step is to start studying outside of my bedroom; go to the library and be around people. It is nothing fancy, but I was always going straight back home after lectures to study so I was very rarely interacting with anyone (even if it is just eye contact) and on some days where I had no lectures, I’d be home all day on my computer. This made my social anxiety worse. Almost every day for the past 1-2 months, I have started going to the library and sitting amongst strangers which is something that always made me anxious. I could have easily put my laptop in my bag and went home – but I didn’t. Not only am I able to focus more and get work done but I am also moving forward in my social goal (no matter how small).

            "{'sequence': \"('My ultimate guide for defeating social anxiety. Hello, I’m a 16 yo male and this is (and probably will be) my only post on this Subreddit. Recently I discovered something great, and I want you to read this post because you’re probably struggling with social anxiety dominating your life like it used to do mine. Remember that „you were born into“ a society. You were raised with patterns to follow. You are scared of breaking these patterns. Scared of breaking out of society. Scared of being rejected by it. Now I want you to differentiate between SOCIETY and HUMANITY. Society is a theoretical construct. A mindset. Society is what has these rules that make you scared of being yourself(„don‘t dress differently“, „don‘t run outside when others see you“ for example.). Humanity are people. Humanity are the people around you and the people you meet. The construct of society and these rules shall not apply for now. In my school bus is always this guy. He enters as one of the last. He‘s probably as old as me. He wears plain black clothes and tries to avoid any eye contact at all. His eyes are dead. When he sits on his seat he doesn‘t even put off his bag from his back. He doesn‘t want to make noise and come off as annoying, even though the bag taking all his space clearly makes him uncomfortable and it bothers him. This guy is affected by society. Not just affected, it‘s dominating all of his actions. Of course noone would give a f*ck if he would just put off his bag, but he still has his made-up rules carved into his mind. This applied to me aswell. Perhaps you may have seen by now that society cares, but humanity clearly doesn’t. Now at one point in the last few days I found a point: „What if I disconnected from all of this?“, „What if I didn‘t care?“. Whenever I am in an anixious situation now, for example walking past a row of cars, I tell myself: „These rules don‘t apply for me now. I‘m free now.“ I‘d like to show you another example. When someone mocks you for being an idiot(let‘s say you just stumbled and fell) and you care about it, you may feel like an idiot. Even worse, you let the bully take control over your emotions. You let him take your soul. Now what if you simply wouldn‘t care? He‘s the idiot now, He keeps mocking about you. But he keeps mocking a god. You are way out of his league now. You don’t care about his existence and his words. Instead of actually feeling like an idiot and feeling he deserves the right to mock you because society says that, he‘s just being a rude child now and you don‘t have to worry about him at all. He‘s still trapped in his little society cage, and you‘re a free and respectable human now. Perhaps maybe you may still think that ignoring society patterns may make you an outsider, and make you end up as a lonely old man/woman without having ever been loved. Think of the most confident man/woman you know. Think of someone harassing him/her. The confident person would never even let the harasser close to affecting its emotions. It doesn‘t have any emotional investment at all in the people around it because society doesn‘t have it caught in its chains. Perhaps maybe the average society-affected person will not like you now, but it will respect you. On the other hand, humanity will not only respect, but love you. Once you disconnect from society you will start to attract many great new people. And it‘s way better than being in the society hole where you have to show heavy commitment everyday in order to not be rejected. I want you to disconnect from society now. Break the patterns, break the barrier. Be comfortable and confident with yourself. This movement doesn‘t take any realistic commitment, I just needs a change in your mind. When you feel anxiety in your actions, don’t care. I don’t want you to demonstrate that you don’t care, I want you to not care. There’s a big difference between showing and doing. You can still be a respectable person and respect other people while not giving a sh*t about the rules of society. I hope I have helped you with this. Keep going. P.S. Since this is my only post here I‘d like to recommend you 2 great books which really helped me on my journey: - „Models“ by Mark Manson (I originally bought this book to be more attractive to women but the book guides you through a internal development too. I highly recommend this book to women aswell) -„Can‘t hurt me“ by David Goggins (This book changed my life)')\", 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with positive effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect', 'outdoor activity or space with negative effect'], 'scores': [0.35915181040763855, 0.32805564999580383, 0.31279245018959045]}\n",

            "{'sequence': '(\\'Social anxiety holding me back in both personal and professional life. Hi everyone, this may be a bit long, but I appreciate anyone who reads even most of this!  and#x200B; Anyway, I\\'m a 24 M living in a big city. And a social anxiety sufferer. My social anxiety isn\\'t physically crippling or physiological -- my physical symptoms are usually pretty limited -- but it\\'s mental and I am an expert in avoidance. I would even say I am a \\\\*very\\\\* social and outgoing person in \"comfortable\" environments (alcohol, bars, sporting events, with friends or people I trust, etc.), but when it comes to \"uncomfortable\" environments including putting myself out there and being alone doing it, I avoid them (joining clubs/sports teams, going to events, meeting new people, talking to people at bars, etc.) altogether.  and#x200B; My social anxiety stems from insecurity and a lack of self-confidence. I wasn\\'t beat up or anything as a kid, but I grew up being bullied, condescended toward, and made fun of for my lack of height at the time -- I was one of the shortest kids in school (I\\'m 5\\'8 now and have not been insecure about this in years) -- and for being skinny and small in general as a man in a society that often sees men like that as weak and a joke. Teachers told me I couldn\\'t audition for roles because of my height, kids my age made fun of me, and adults made snide comments. All of this contributed toward deeply ingraining into my head a fundamental insecurity. I wore sweatshirts during the summer and shirts at the beach because I had terrible body image issues. From the age of like 10. **Long story short, from an early age I was very insecure, had major body image issues, and terrible self-confidence and this contributed greatly to creating my social anxiety.**  and#x200B; **Fast forward to today.** I am still skinny and small and find that the women who are into me tend to be 2-3 years younger usually because I \\\\*do\\\\* look young and small for my age. Dating can be frustrating. But, I am going to the gym, I\\'m starting to feel more confident in my body, and I know that I have had a good amount of romantic opportunities, even if it has never worked out into a relationship. I feel good about myself, have become extremely self-aware of my own insecurities and how I projected them in the past, and in general I am content. But, I still cannot get over the avoidance of social anxiety. It\\'s ingrained into my head.  and#x200B; **It has prevented me from making more friends** in a new city -- the idea of doing a Meetup or joining a club is terrifying to me. And I just avoid doing that kind of thing altogether. **It has prevented me from, say, talking to women at a bar,** \\\\*even in\\\\* a drunken state when I feel good about myself. It just takes over and I tell myself I\\'m not attractive, that I\\'m going to embarrass myself, etc. It has essentially reduced my chances of meeting women to only on dating apps. **And it also has held me back in my career and what I want to do in life**. I\\'m a deeply political person but I can\\'t network. I can\\'t bring myself to go to happy hour\\'s by myself or join political clubs or anything. I simply cannot put myself out there alone into unfamiliar situations. The thought of being awkward or having no one to talk to or being seen as ridiculous or an idiot -- these things fill my head and so avoid these situations altogether.  and#x200B; I don\\'t want to look back five years from now and not have made more friends, not have taken a risk romantically by talking to someone I didn\\'t know, and not have truly tried to pursue my political dreams. I have gone to therapy lately but the appointments are few and far in-between (once a month at best) and while it has helped me become even more self-aware, it has not helped me with, well, changing my brain chemistry. And I don\\'t want to be resigned to thinking this is just how I am going to be. I am missing out on so many opportunities from friends to partners to career/hobbies. **Above all, I am frustrated that I have all the logical solutions to this problem (Who actually cares what people think of you?), but that does nothing for what feels like an innate reaction to unfamiliar situations**. **I can be confident one moment and then crumble the next. I get rejected in some form and it just feeds into a spiral.** **This is very long and I am rambling, but thought I would find friendly ears here. Maybe people in my shoes who have suggestions and have conquered (or struggle with) the same things I have.

            "{'sequence': \"('I find a problem with every community I could become a part of. I'm 21 and this is something I struggle with a lot. It feels like most communities I have tried to be a part of have features around them that made me distance myself from being a part of that community. I understand that I am the problem in this situation and I'm probably overgeneralizing everything. Here are some examples: I enjoy casual gaming, but not enough to care about gaming news or events. I feel like a huge amount of people in the gaming community my age are overly edgy, rage a lot over games or are neckbeardy which scares me off. I also hate playing video games for hours on end, I get burnt out really easily and gamers usually like to have long sessions with each other. I drifted away from my gaming friends because the burnout from playing video games for hours at a time was too much for me. I enjoy hip hop and r andb, but a lot of the culture around this for my age is associated with people who smoke weed, drink, and go clubbing, which intimidates me as I don't like the loss of control associated with drugs and loud 'carefree' environments like clubs. I also feel like there's huge pressure to be on social media within this community. In high school I was friends with people who were into this community a lot and as they got older we drifted apart as they became clubbers and big on alcohol etc. I enjoy football, but I hate the competitiveness that comes with playing it (even socially, you'll get shouted at or made fun of for mistakes) and there is a hyper masculine/ drinking community stereotype associated with casual footballers my age. I also am terrible at football! I have always dabbled in and out of this community but as I was never very good, I didn't really get any respect, and I found playing a very high pressure scenario. All the above seem like immaturity problems, but there are other communities Ive tried to get into that I didn't have this problem with but I just didn't enjoy being a part of them. For example I have tried an art community, but I am not very good at art which made me embarassed whenever I went to the classes, and the way I think I naturally struggled to make and critique art. I also just felt very uncomfortable in this environment, which I think may be due to the fact that I'm not very passionate about art. I'm happy I at least tried though. I have tried a board game community, but I found it too nerdy for me, and I just didn't find any of the board games we played fun. I just didn't feel engaged enough and as passionate as the others were about the games, and the people in the group were all a lot older than me. I'm constantly looking for communities I can join which I will feel comfortable with. I am thinking maybe a running community. However I am worried that this problem is going to follow me everywhere since I seem to perfectionistic about who I be friends with. Like I already know I don't care about run times and stuff so I may feel out of place being surrounded by people who do care. If anyone else has dealt with this, it would be great to hear some advice.

I left it a few days and then snapped him a pic of me at the pool (swimsuit pic lol) and was like “what are you up to?” And he opened it and never replied.

What do i do to make friends? Am a really sarcastic guy? Or a bland/boring guy? Who should i be when talking to others? How do i make people close to me? Maybe i should focus less on making friends online. Im worried so much about this.. im worried about what to say next. What do couples talk about everyday and never run out of things to talk about?? My questions are boring as hell. I just get yes or no answers... my convos are always generic.. i send 100 girls messages and i still dont get replied..am i just desperate or what. No one wants to hangout with me. Im so bad at everything. I feel like i dont exist. Im nobody. Everyone ignores me. Its like i want to be popular real bad just like my friends..idk how to stop trying My family always calls me a loser.. a man with no plans or future or skills. Im so lame. Im so annoying too. No one likes me. Im a nonsense and my talks are nonsense too. No wonder any cute girl would never put any effort in me. Its because i dont deserve it. I have nothing to offer. I have no personality. Im dumb. I never fit in.. And people get to me sometimes so easily. Im not really tough or assertive or a bastard that pushes away those who are mean to him. In texting while trying so much to make girls like me or value me or at least just say hello to me i try a lot and i turn out to be weird or boring or my talks are absolute nonsense... i dont know how to talk. Idk anything. How some guys text so little to girls and girls still be interested in them? I dont have that superpower. Im not fun or cool. Am a total loser with a retarded mindset and tottaly boring/bland. Im not a badass or cool kid or a guy that people take seriously. Im invisible and no one really respects me. I always put more effort in than others.. but no one puts any effort into me. What do i do to make people like me??? But my convos are always dry or boring or bland or i run out of interesting questions to ask.. i ask questions like an interview and most times just get a Yes or no.. no one cares about me or loves me or thinks im important.. im just a stupid invisible boring nice guy.. Idk how to be interested in people, idk how to make friends...im not even interested in my self. I hate my self.. Idk who i am, idk how to realize who i am, idk how to find out who i want to be? Some role model? Like who? James bond? What are convos suppose to be like? In real life and online?? I try really hard to make people laugh. It happens when i see someone being funny.. so i try to say something funny too. It turns out bad... I have spent so much of my life trying to be noticed/valued/heard.. and trying to get people to give me attention.. there is so much anger inside my towards my self and everything around me.. Im always one to text first guess im really needy and chase others approval and please people just to be my friend.. this is pathetic and idk how to fix it.. Im not the one who people love Im not the one that people chase I have no skills Im not anyones best friend I dont get invited to anything I dont have friends irl or a GF. I have no job either.. Im not loved by anyone, not important for anyone.. Im only nice or rude. Which both are dumb and arent really a quality. But being rude is better than being nice to girls...idk who to be. I only play soccer watch movies and listen to music. These are the 3 things i do nothing more... Im not creative or funny or intelligent or charming or cool or smart or confindent or charismatic like James bond.. im worthless and i have no qualities at all..i have no personality im like a robot..i have no humour or no orginality in me.

I have no clinical thinking..im not good to anything. Im basically like a servent when i talk to girls.. and i can be fooled so easily.. i cant fool people either.. even for fun.. because im like a joke to people.. maybe im just mean.. maybe i have a really big ego.. i have really passive aggressive jokes too.. idk how to get to know people, i dont know how to know people.. Im jealous of people with a lot of friends.. and jealous of those who have banter with each other or calling each other nicknames.. im invisible.. I try really hard to make friends online its like i want people to fill the hole of emptiness inside me..all i been thinking about is getting a GF. Not sure if i want it but i feel like it will fix all my problems.. do i even have problems? Idk.. Im addicted to porn i can escape but then i havs nothing to do and idk what to do to self improvement.. Im jealous of people who got girls chasing them and girls interested in them, jealous of ppl who get attention.. like i used to be worried about likes and rts...

            "{'sequence': '(\\'[LONG/VENT] My first 2 therapy sessions made me feel worse. What should I do?. 25 year old male, living with my mom alone. I\\'ve never worked in my life. Never been in a relationship. Haven\\'t had a friend IRL in 10 years, which is also the amount of time that I\\'ve avoided going outside entirely unless absolutely necessary (a handful of times.). Never really been diagnosed with anything, but I have really bad social anxiety for sure. Deep depression and personality issues, adhd, possibly autistic spectrum. Who knows. I\\'ve avoided going to therapy/doctors for my entire life due to my anxiety and negative thoughts. I would talk with people online and I would always say that I would never go to a therapist, and thought it would never help me. This was based on brief interactions that I\\'ve had with therapists online, and me looking up stuff about therapists on the internet. Recently, other physical health issues of mine got so bad that I had to go to the ER, which lead me to going to a general doctor, which lead me to finally try to find a therapist. Problem is, I\\'m poor. I only have free insurance from the government, and there\\'s only a handful of therapists in my area that take it. I looked at their profiles. A lot of them honestly made me upset and uncomfortable, so I tried calling the ones that I thought I might get along with. Every. Single. One. said they weren\\'t accepting new clients. Which lead me to my only other option, going to a \"health center\" or something like that, dunno what it\\'s called, but it\\'s the place where courts send people who have drug addictions and stuff. I didn\\'t really have an option and they basically just automatically assigned me a therapist. I felt very uncomfortable with the idea of it. I don\\'t get along with people very well in general. I have a very low tolerance, but I\\'m so horrified of expressing my negative and rude thoughts out of fear for rejection. I really wanted to be able to choose someone that I thought would fit me well, but I still forced myself to give it a try anyways. I had this picture in my mind of how it would play out. I would come in, sit down. He would ask me questions and try to figure me out, understand my issues. I would try to open up, but mostly fail because I\\'m so anxious and I\\'m really bad at expressing myself. He would give hid input, professional advice, or \"help\", that would just upset and trigger me because I feel like it\\'s just generalized advice for \"normal\" people that\\'s not addressing the root cause of my issues. I would reject the help, repeatedly, until the therapist got sick of my rejection that they got rid of me and sent me to someone else. The fear of being rejected like that is so great that... It just makes it so hard to express my real thoughts and what I think. Anyways, what actually happened when I went to therapy... I guess it was what I expected and also not what I expected... what I expected was to be asked more questions, like he would make attempts at trying to figure me out or understand me, and that didn\\'t happen very much. I tried talking about some of my issues anyways, and he said a lot of things that really upset me deeply, but I didn\\'t feel comfortable expressing out of fear of upsetting him/him rejecting me. There was a lot of \"Learn to love yourself\"/accept yourself/accept negative beliefs/be mindful/cbt kind of comments and ideas that he said. I don\\'t know. I don\\'t really feel it addressed my issues very well. I really didn\\'t want to go the second time, despite the first one making me feel worse. I hoped that after going to the first session, that I would have just a tiny bit of relief, and a tiny bit of hope that MAYBE I could improve and work towards getting better, but it left me feeling more hopeless. I didn\\'t want to go the second time, but it was more of the same basically. It\\'s really hard for me to recall most of the things he said as I have a really bad memory, but most of it upset me and I suppressed my triggered feelings of anger and upset, again out of fear of being rejected and referred away. He talked about quicksand in analogy to struggles, and about how the more you fight against it, the more you sink, and you just need to calm down and just accept the issues and just let them be there. My mind screamed at me, NO!!!!!! I need help with my issues. I can\\'t just accept this. I can\\'t accept how of a miserable spot I\\'m in right now. I\\'m so fucking hopeless. I want to improve, not just sit around accepting and sitting in my misery. He talked about how he believes that everyone is fundamentally \"good enough\" and \"Okay\", which at my core I deeply disagree with. I definitely don\\'t feel good enough, and have so many areas that I need to improve upon, and need help with improving on. I feel like he did more talking than I did as well, and that he didn\\'t really want to seem to ask much questions or try to figure me out... is that normal? I want my issues to be addressed and I don\\'t feel like they are being addressed. And I don\\'t know if it\\'s just my anxiety, but the interactions with him were so awkward and unbearable, but that\\'s just how I am in social situations in general, all social interactions feel awkward and unbearable to me so I don\\'t know if that was him or me. I scheduled a third appointment coming up this Friday, in hope that maybe it will somehow turn around and change, and start slowly helping me instead of making me feel worse and more hopeless when I go. I don\\'t really feel have any options. I\\'m so absolutely stuck in life right now. I\\'m so hopeless and I don\\'t know what to do. I feel like I need help, but so far I don\\'t feel like this is helping, and I don\\'t fee like it could help, and I don\\'t know what could possibly help me. All I know is that this isn\\'t so far and I don\\'t know what to do. I don\\'t know how therapy is supposed to go in the first place, or what to look out for, or what to expect from it, but I should feel like I\\'m getting SOME kind of benefit out of it, right? Is it normal to feel this negative towards it at first? I know how unstable and negative I can be... maybe it\\'s just me getting in my own head, but maybe therapy isn\\'t right for me and maybe I should jump ship? I just don\\'t know what to do.

I think I may or may not have overheard that she might be dating someone and so I\\'m like 90% she is but not 100% certain.  andnbsp; She\\'s so incredibly cute and I really wish I was able to talk to her and express myself a bit better around her.

She\\'s initiated random conversations with me several times, and I always respond positively, and sometimes it even seemed like she would go out of the way to talk to me. One time I was walking forward and she walked right past me and I was gonna say hi awkwardly like I normally do, but she walked right by, then she turned back and said \"hey how are you doing kevin?\", and she seemed really interested. I always just default to saying \"good how are you\", and she ended up saying \"i\\'m doing really good\" and honestly just seemed super excited but the conversation kind of just ended since I didn\\'t know what else to say and she was like awkwardly walking backwards back to her desk while tripping and regaining balance on her foot lol. We also went on an after-lunch walk together and we had a really fun chat (we both just happened to go out walking at the same time).  andnbsp; Every time I see her when we walk by like going to the cafeteria, at most I just awkwardly say hi and that\\'s it.

I pay attention to how she acts to me and am hopelessly hoping and overthinking everything she does that might indicate that she possibly likes me too, when it\\'s incredibly unlikely.

I’ve never spoken out about my problems, and I’m not sure why I’ve come to reddit of all places but I’m just really hoping someone will listen to me and maybe understand... Basically my entire life has been revolved around making my mother happy, or her dictating what I can and can’t do. She always emailed my teachers when I was in elementary, middle, and even high school. She didn’t believe I could say what I needed to say or get the help if I didn’t understand something. She had an app that would show her my grades, and anytime I’d get a bad grade I knew that she was going to scold me. Now I fear that I will fail, and I do not know how to cope with failure at all. Whenever I’ve had boyfriends in the past she has always hovered over us 24/7. At 18 I decided to go to the movies with my best friend (he happens to be a guy but our relationship is strictly platonic). In the middle of the movie she turns on the find my iphone alert. Everyone in the theater turns to me because the alert sound is so loud. I have to run outside because I’m so embarrassed. I answer the phone and she’s yelling at me because apparently the map showed that I wasn’t where I told her I was (so she was spying on my location..). We argued and she made up some dumb excuse for why she embarrassed me.. saying the weather was bad and that she was concerned, but that it was my fault because I left when I knew the weather would be bad. I’m 19 now. She has access to all my emails (except one that I use for reddit) and social media. I now have social anxiety to the point where my mom has to do everything for me. Anytime our opinions don’t match or I give her “tough love” she tells me she feels betrayed by me. When I order food at restaurants I either let her order for me or I look to her for approval to go ahead and order. It is not even on purpose, it is just habit. When I’m at the doctors office I will explain my issues the best that I can, but she always has to add something because my explanation wasn’t good enough. When I get bad grades, I have a panic attack. I ask myself “what will mom do when she finds out?” I’ve never had a job because I’m too scared to work. My mom is obsessed with my weight. I am 130 pounds and 5 foot exactly. I’m a little on the thicker side but I’m not fat. There have been times when shes grabbed the fat on my arms, my least favorite body part, and said I don’t want my arms to look like “chicken legs” or something like that. I actually don’t normally hate my body, but every time she points something out I start noticing and hating it. Recently I went on antidepressants for my social anxiety. It’s only been about a week on them so I don’t expect much difference and there hasnt been yet. I know SSRI’s can take a while to work. I have eaten pretty normally, but my mom is obsessed with weight gain. I know they can make you gain weight, but its like thats all she talks about. These meds make you really tired so i havent been motivated, but she is forcing me to walk in the heat with her. Ive been telling her how tired they make me, but its like she doesnt understand. So I walked with her and afterwards felt so nauseous that i thought i was going to throw up (and i already have once). I don’t have anymore friends. I haven’t drove my car once this entire summer, and I hardly leave the house. Somedays I feel like a miserable excuse for a person, and this has made me think suicidal thoughts. The other day my mom actually told me that I don’t have depression because its not as bad as someone else she knows. No, maybe I don’t have “depression” but that doesn’t mean I don’t contemplate death. Before I started this medication I thought about death every single day and never told anyone. I love my mom, but this is the result of helicopter parenting. Now, I can’t even order food for myself or call the doctors office to set up an appointment. I would never want my child to go through what I now go through on a day to day basis. I feel like I’ve regressed back to infancy, always looking to my mom for approval. Raising my hand in class is an improvement for me. And that is just sad. At the same time my mom is nagging me to join clubs and make friends and I’m still trying to figure out how to raise my damn hand in class without having a panic attack. But no improvement is ever good enough. If I told her I raised my hand in class for the first time in 6 months she’d tell me that I need to force myself to join a club instead. Then I’m called too sensitive because I regress back into my shell after her statement. And apparently, we don’t believe in congratulating someone for little things like raising their hand because thats nothing. I am going to have to see my school counselor once the semester starts. I cannot keep living like this. This isn’t a reality to me. There is no way this is what my life has become. I have so much to say, and so many dreams of my own. I want to be successful. I don’t want to be figuring out how to be normal functioning human when I’m only months away from being 20.. I’m sorry if this whole thing sounds very melodramatic. I guess it is going to be dramatic for me... i’ve been dealing with it for at least 7 years now. 7 years of social anxiety that has gotten worse and worse over time.

I’m scared my dates will judge me for having relatively little sexual experience. (I’ve only had sex a few times) I’m also scared they will judge me for my living situation (more on that below). * I live with my parents still, since my line of work is hard to break into (Writing). I did secure an internship from home recently, which has the potential to move into full time work. I’m terrified that a potential partner will judge me for this. * I’ve come to the realization this last year that I’m fairly happy with only a close friend or two, yet I believe even an introvert should get out of the house semi-regularly. Can I balance both the loner and involved lifestyles? * I’m trying to lose a lot of weight and so far have succeeded. I cut out all junk food, soda, alcohol and fried foods and don’t eat meat three days a week. I exercise by jogging 5 miles a day. * I’ve re-entered therapy, since it’s extremely beneficial to my well-being. Am I too old to gain a decent social life, partner and job?

It was obvious she was very interested in me, and I got interested in her too. I added her on Facebook after that school trip and she messaged me the next day, saying that she had seen me leaving school but I was already too far away. We chatted for a slight bit and then she said her class had ended she was leaving school. I just said \"ok, talk to you later\" or something along the lines. In reality she wanted me to tell her to meet up, considering that I was free, at home and so was she, free, leaving school. That was the end of our conversation, period. Over the next few weeks/months I kept seeing her at school seeing as we had similar schedules. We\\'d say hi and she\\'d always chat me up. At first we\\'d talk for 5-10 or more minutes. That faded to just saying hi, to not even acknowledging (or rather avoiding) her most times, even though the only thing I thought about while at school was seeing her. That went on for an entire year. The next school year started and for some reason I told my about all this and he, obviously, said how much of a dumbass I for not making a move. So I decided I had to confront her, which just so coincided with her birthday. I messaged her at night on Facebook, saying happy birthday. She responded early in the morning, said thank you and that she was heading up to the university. I, as well, had a class so I said I\\'d see her there. I saw her there and we talked for what seemed like an hour. At the end of it, I just confronted her about what had happened, asked her if she was expecting me to make a move (which I obviously knew the answer to, and it was yes), she said yes. Asked her if she\\'d be down to try to get things going now and she agreed. She had another class and I didn\\'t so I left for home and messaged her as soon as I got there. We talked for the entire day, until she went to her birthday party where she wouldn\\'t have access to a phone or internet. We kept talking non-stop every day, and not in a friend kind of way. It was obvious we were getting together. We met up. Texted. Talked. Met up again. Dated for like 3 weeks or a month and while I was very nervous at times, it was the best weeks of my life. I still remember her touch. Her kissing my cheek, my neck. After that she suddenly texts me saying she feels the relationship is heading towards a friendship rather than a girlfriend/boyfriend type of a situation, and that was due to me not showing enough affection, love. An *entire year* of being obsessed with her, finally mustering up the courage to confront her, us getting together only for it to fall apart so quickly absolutely *devastated* me. I was dead. Dead. We agreed on being friends, and we kept in touch. Talked on Facebook and met up from time to time. While I obviously still had feelings for her, and she was aware of it, it wasn\\'t too bad. Yes I was sulking at times, but I was getting by. There were times where I didn\\'t really even think of her that much. - And then this Friday...We decided to meet up because she messaged me saying she missed me a ton (I had seen her over coffee two weeks prior). We met up near our school, walked around for about an hour, then went to a bar where a friend of mine works and drank, but not a lot. Just got tipsy. We probably spent 3-4 hours there, talking non-stop. Then I took her home (which is pretty far away from mine). We sat outside her house at 1am talking and talking. It felt exactly like the times when we were together. And that, I think, was the final nail the coffin. Experiencing a situation so similar to the ones when we were dating brought it *all* back. I\\'ve had my moments of depression, usually a day or two, but it\\'s never been this bad. I am extremely depressed and see no reason to live at all (not even considering suicide or harming myself). I can\\'t get back with her, but I can\\'t get her out of my head either. *All* I think about is her. The very first thought, every single day I wake up is her name. I don\\'t see cutting her off as an option either because of two reasons. One, I *do* want to just be friends with her if being a couple is not an option because I get along with her more than anyone else I\\'ve met in my life. And more importantly, two, not being in contact with her doesn\\'t seem to make me lose affection for her. I had almost zero contact with for an entire year and I was still madly in love.

I went to the gaeltacht (irish speaking summer camp, 3 weeks only speaking irish away from home), when I was 13-15, and it was an amazing experience. I made new friends from all over the country, fell in love with the language, laughed so much every day. We stayed in houses and in each house was 1-2 leaders which were super bubbly talkative people who had to bring us out of our shell, break the ice in the early days, make sure we didn\\'t speak english, and they also ran daily activities. I knew I was shy but I wanted to be a leader and I thought if I didn\\'t know anyone then I\\'d be able to be that talkative and bubbly. When I was 16, I went as a leader. Everyone was SO SO extroverted, and because we were being \"evaluated\" by our superiors, being watched to see how well we mixed and interacted with other people, I got stage fright and didn\\'t talk to anyone. It was horrible, I felt so ashamed of myself for thinking I could do this and for being the only one who was shy. They must have been thinking \"what the hell is she doing here\". Long story short, none of the other leaders liked me. Like, they hated me. They\\'d talk to me and I\\'d be super quiet and they\\'d do the \"okaaaaay\" and their eyes would dart around and smile at someone when they talked to me. They also gave me grief one day because this boy asked me out, they were making fun of me, which hurt because the girl who was laughing at me was once my leader when I was a student, and I used to be the type of kid who would idolise and have faith in people. This experience broke that. We have one day where parents visit and most people go to a neighbouring town for lunch with them, I saw the other leaders and said \"Hi!!\" and they blanked me. To give context, this wasn\\'t a \"job\", leaders tend to form a close knit group, and I was outside of this. We had a day out to the cinema and there was no room on the bus so I had to go in a teachers car. The teacher shouted into the bus \"who wants to come with me and aoiphes in the car?\", no one moved. Anyway, I don\\'t know why exactly but my faith in others and more importantly myself broke, and is still broken. I actually blocked the experience out, I used to think about it at night and literally sweat and cry and push it out of my mind - it was humiliation, 3 straight weeks of it. I\\'m leaving specific bits out because they\\'re hard to describe but a lot of my flashbacks were of peoples expressions of suppressed laughter anytime I spoke to them. Or another leader rolling her eyes at me for not being good enough. It was like, you know when you do something silly by accident in front of people, and you think about it for years but the amount you think of it decreases with time? Well it\\'s like that, only happening continuously for 3 weeks. I honestly think I got PTSD from that experience. It took me years to allow myself to think about it, and it was painful. My description probably doesn\\'t make it sound that bad, but it was just things happening over and over again that confirmed for me that I was a failure and everyone hates me. Learning negative things about yourself one after the other with no time to process. It\\'s been better lately. Sometimes I think about it without cringing.

Hey guys, I've been anxious and depressed enough that I can't take it anymore, when I was the age of 0-14 I was a funny, very social, empathious fun kid. I always had friends, always was a part of everything and everyone recognized me for my laughing. Untill I hit my puberty ( not the reason why I'm anxious I think ) since that time I got even scared to open the door, I still don't have a job ( I'm 16 now ) and I'm currently in wait for my new school which I'm 2 months later then everyone else. Just because I canceled my other school since I was too anxious of finding a internship work place. I still only have old friends from the time when I was 'myself' and no new ones. I've always been very hyper since I was a kid and then my parents decided to diagnose me and turned out I had ADHD. It dind't bother me at that time. I do speak to my parents but not very much. Especially not about my feelings which I don't do with barely anyone. I dissapoint them alot with my anxious feelings for example the one from when I needed to find the internship work place. My mom keeps saying that I'm anxious because I have been judged by everyone my whole life and I know she is right but its not only that, I have also been taking Ritalin for a few years and from that moment everything changed, one day when I felt very anxious after 30 minutes of taking my Ritalin. I was in school at lunch break just with a bunch of friends because I wasn't having those anxious issues then, but I felt very depressed and anxious then and I also later called my mom asked if I could go home because I was feeling sick. I dind't mention that I was anxious to her. Next day I woke up and again took my dose of Ritalin ( I'm not gonna call it medication ) I felt exactly the same as the day before so I called my mom again and asked if I could go home. I still dind't tell about the anxious and negative thought I had. From that moment I wasn't feeling myself untill this day. I am feeling so tired, nothing makes me happy and I just feel so fucking miserable and anxious about even doing the smallest things. The worst thing is that I KNOW I can be myself because I have been in the past, but I don't know how or what to do. I'm also using little doses of sativa or hybrid strains of weed ( I vaporize them ) and it does really help for my ADHD to calm down my brains but it still doesn't make me feel myself happy from how I used to be. Obviously I still have some days where I feel happy but those only happen like once in a month . I also once was out for dinner with the whole fam and I was feeling very drowsy and just not active but I brought my filled vaporizer ( dry herb vaporizer ) with weed. So I vaped outside and I was myself again, I was talking to my fam and it was like I was reborn again. When I got home I was so happy and mostly proud, I later said to my mom what I did when I went outside and she already knew I smoke and shes okay with it as long as I don't get addicted and she also was a bit happy because she really saw the diffrence, its not always when weed works like that. But when I'm with friends and I smoke I always feel very comfortable around them and have a good time. They mostly make me forget to look at my phone so thats a good sign. I really want to feel like how I used to because most people liked me then alot. I also stopped growing from when I was using the Ritalin and last year I have grown so much from the moment when I stopped using it. I feel like ritalin fucked up my serotonin receptors because I know alot about all drugs. I know that Ritalin is in the same family as speed which makes it possible that it fucked up my serotonin receptors. Anyhow I've also tried LSD a couple of times and it made me social anxious as fuck, really dind't wanna see anyone when I did that. But I know that that isn't how I am because I used to be so social but how come I'm not anymore? If anyone has tips or questions. Please feel free to ask / tell them!! I use L-theanine now for a while and it makes me alot more relaxed in my head, but they don't bring back the old me. I don't use chemical pills ever again because they're dangerous and addictive. Not only because they're toxic itself but also because they might have fucked up my whole personality. Its insane that when I think of it now they just give speed to 8 year olds because they have a disorder which makes them hyper in their head. Its not right, thats the reason why I only use natural products to relax my brain, L-Theanine, weed and omega-3. I also have used XTC like 3 times and when I do xtc I can talk to people again with no problem and it just goes extremely easy then. But I don't use it more then twice a year.

Now it\\'s even worse though because it happens at work, and I work on movie sets, and on movie sets they usually record sound because it\\'s post-1920, which means everyone on set needs to be DEAD silent. Sometimes there are emotional scenes with long, silent pauses in between actors\\' lines. Sometimes there\\'s just quiet while they\\'re waiting for an airplane to go by. And at the end of every day or when they finish shooting in a particular space, they record \"room tone\" which is just 30 seconds of complete, 100% silence. And usually these spaces are very small and filled with lots of people like the director, the script supervisor, the 1st AD, the DP, the 1st AC, the 2nd AC, the boom operator and/or sound mixer, 1+ talent, possibly other department heads like the gaffer, key grip, production designer, or makeup, possibly multiple PAs there to make sure everybody is quiet, etc. and if you make noise you\\'ve fucked up the take. I have such severe anxiety about stomach noises on set that I basically try to avoid actually being on set as much as possible. I\\'m constantly terrified of getting stuck inside when they\\'re about to shoot, because as an electrician I might need to be nearby for small, last second lighting adjustments, or even worse, to do a light gag (lights go on/off or flicker/dim during the shot). I avoid it at all costs and try to stay in an area with no people or somewhere outside where it\\'s loud.

I\\'ve noticed it seems to happen more when I\\'m anxious, which is almost all the time, and additionally, when I\\'m anxious ABOUT it happening--like it causes itself in a vicious feedback loop.

            "{'sequence': \"('Social Anxiety from eating in public. Advice on self-help tips for overcoming this?. Sorry in advance for the long story that i’m about to post but I hope you guys give it a read. I’ve been getting social anxiety especially from eating in public for 2-3 years now and the fact that I can’t even have a peaceful/enjoyable meal out with my friends have been eating me inside out and I want to overcome this so so so badly. The past few years has honestly been the worst few years of my life and I so desperately want things to change. The eating anxiety I have doesn’t really come from being afraid of being looked at in public, its more of being afraid that I would gag/throw up when eating because of the intense nauseous feelings I get whenever I am eating outside in public and it simply just kills my appetite. Its like a vicious cycle. This is how it all started. 3 years ago, I was still all fine with very minimal social anxiety. Since young I have always been a shy and quiet person if you don’t get to know me well but among my friends i’d like to think that I am quite talkative and fun. I hung out with friends very easily in school and used to enjoy going out with them. I even had many friends from the “popular” group in school if that’s what you call them. However sadly this changed for the worse in 2017. I was finishing school and was about to enter mandatory military service. I suddenly got so much anxiety ever since I was about to enter military as there was so much uncertainties that I had about it. I was afraid that I would have a tough time, afraid that I would not be able to adapt to a very different environment, afraid of missing home too much etc. To put it shortly, there were so many things that were not under my control that gave me so much anxiety during this period. I was still at school when all these anxiety came about, and it seemed to just keep getting worse during that time. Sometimes in the morning before going to school i’d feel nauseous for no reason, even brushing my teeth in the morning would cause me to gag. Sometimes (even though rarely) I would even have to go to the toilet just because I felt like throwing up from the nausea I was getting. I started losing appetite very easily and started to rarely have a proper meal during lunch time in school. I started avoiding going out with my friends because of all this feelings I was getting stemming from the anxiety I got. Fast forward to now, I have completed my service and about to start uni early next year. I would say that my anxiety has gotten much better compared to where I was a few years back. However I was never the same in terms of eating in public ever since. I still get all nauseous/choked up/no appetite whenever I am eating outside. When I eat at home its the complete opposite, I can properly enjoy a good meal with no issues at all when i’m home, because I feel “safe”, that even if I throw up/gag nobody can notice or judge. And because of this sense of safety, ironically I don’t have any anxiety at all and don’t feel any nausea, However when i’m out I can only eat in small bites and I find it so difficult to even finish a normal meal. Its taken such a massive toll on my social life. In the past I would hang out with my friends every week, and also go outside to play sports every week. Now these things rarely ever happen anymore, not because I wasn’t invited but because I had to reject my friends every time they asked me out because I didn’t want to end up embarassing myself when we have a meal. Honestly this really hurt me so much because my friends probably now thinks I am deliberately avoiding them or that I don’t wanna hang out with them anymore but the truth is I really don’t have a choice because of all the anxiety I have had experienced. Sometimes I just wished that everyone can understand how I feel or what I am going through. I am starting school again in a few months and I really want to just change myself, and go back to my old self where I had no anxiety when eating in public, where I could really feel joy and happiness when going out with my family and friends, where I don’t have to keep worrying about my eating anxiety, and where I can just feel genuinely happy again. Please advice me on tips I can use as self-help to overcome my social eating anxiety, and thank you for taking the time off your day to read my story. ☺️')\", 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with negative effect', 'outdoor activity or space with positive effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect'], 'scores': [0.41184669733047485, 0.3290555775165558, 0.25909772515296936]}\n",

I experienced most/all of the things you mention. I wouldn’t go anywhere for weeks for fear of people seeing me. I was terrified if I went outside to get the mail that a neighbor would see me and judge me. I’d only go grocery shopping at bizarre hours and only use the self check out because of fear of what the cashier would think of me and my purchases. Going to any social event caused panic attacks (sweating, trembling, trouble breathing, chest pain, dizziness). I lived a solitary life and would go months without social interaction. Going so long without having so much as a conversation made me really awkward in any social interaction that I did have. I would be really quiet and keep to myself. Afterwards I’d over-analyze everything that happened, even for days or weeks. So how did I climb out…? Very slowly. I have been on and off antidepressants (SSRIs) since I was 15, never on for longer than 3 months, then I would hop back on when I started to feel really down. I think they helped with the depression, but not so much the social anxiety. I have been on and off therapy as well…and couldn’t really commit to that either. It’s hard to go tell someone your most intimate feelings and thoughts when you’re afraid of how they’re judging you. However, I think it does help some people. I was recommended this [book](It might help. I made one friend towards the end of high school. I had no idea why he wanted to be my friend, but I was so desperate for a friend I just went with it. I found it much easier to just hang with 1 person than a large group that I didn’t know. Then I made one really good friend in my first year of college. She much more actively took action to become my friend, than me becoming hers. We became basically inseparable, and she was my only friend for a while but that was okay because all my social needs were met through her. I transferred schools and she got a boyfriend and our very codependent relationship kinda fell apart. I felt lost for a while, but that is when I realized that I shouldn’t be that dependent on someone else. I made a friend at my new school. I moved on campus and started interacting more with my roommates. I became involved with clubs. I started by just attending talks and meetings, then eventually went onto becoming an officer. A lot of classes were team projects, so I befriended some teammates. I took a teaching assistant position and met people that way. As my circle of friends grew, I met more friends through them. I threw some parties. I went to parties. I learned that sometimes you have to be assertive when making friends. I faked confidence and asked people to hang out, chatted them up online, said hi and talked to them when I saw them. Eventually, it starts to feel less forced and more natural. By the time I graduated I had a great group of friends ranging from very close to not so close. It wasn’t smooth sailing always. I had a really hard time during my internship. I didn’t fit in with the other interns at all. It was like they just looked at me and labeled me as a loser. I felt very socially awkward since most of my friends were also very nerdy/geeky and the interns were a different breed. I did try, but I failed and it was a hard summer for me. I spent most my weekends alone while the others were out doing what interns should do when spending the summer in a beautiful new city. About 6 months ago I moved to a new city, and it’s been tough making friends and adjusting. I feel the insecurities and low self-esteem creeping in on me. I hated constantly meeting new people and small talk. I’m so paranoid that people will see through my confident veneer and find me to be just a giant loser. I miss the easiness with my friends. I tried organizing events with some people at work, but those fell through. Sucks being in a new city with so much to do, but no one to do with it. In the back of my mind, I still fear that if I go do things alone people will see me think of me as a friendless loser. As you can see it’s still a struggle sometimes, but I know I’ve come a long way. I don’t think I’ll ever be the life of the party or 100% not socially awkward. I still have fears and insecurities, but I think the best way to get over them is to just face them. Sometimes you’ll fail real hard, but you’ll learn and get better. I know it’ll be a while before I build a social network like the one I had in college. I’m gonna try taking a fun class after work, meetup.com, and finding a place to volunteer. I’m planning on facing my fear of doing things alone…and I’m gonna go out there and do things alone and hopefully make friends along the way.

Please stop smoking and drinking alcohol. Find an alternative, even vaping or whatever. When you try a certain way and it doesn't work, try another way. Alcohol is a depressant. Smoking shits on your health. Don't consume them. Take up classes. Dance, martial arts, parkour, cooking, anything. Help the community out, volunteer. The Meetup app has clubs you can join to meet people of similar interests. The best way to rid yourself of social anxiety is through exposure. You can learn social skills. You have so much potential, OP. You just have to keep your head up despite the challenges (it will not be easy), and don't let yourself stop you from progressing. Our biggest demons are not the adversities around us, but ourselves. Keep a realistic mindset and you can get to what you want. Be wary of absolute thinking patterns. You can do it. Whenever you get depressive, be your own cheerleader and remind yourself of what you can achieve. You are never weak due to mental illness. Having mental illness is hardcore, and you are so strong for wrangling it. If you need further support, hit me up. I'll be happy to help you in any way I can.

            "{'sequence': '(\\' In my school we always talked about how there was obvious bullying and \"inside-bullying\". I\\'ve been a big victim of the inside-bullying too. Nobody respected me and they obviously talked behind my back because they thought I was annoying or weird or unlikeable and like you\\'ve experienced, they also made these strange proclamations of my name in class too and I think the straw that broke the camels back was when I started to realize that when we had to do the \"find someone to be in group with\" stuff people would walk away as soon as I walked over to them even if I had occasionally talked with them before. It\\'s a testament to how bad my social skills were and how asocial i was outside of classes but what could I do? I couldn\\'t figure it out and people started to think me annoying for it which led to internal bullying. In middle school I had more of it. People would always put me down for whatever I did that wasn\\'t academically succesful which was at least nice so I had something I was okay at, at the time. If I started running people would point and laugh because \"you\\'re a nerd and you can\\'t be sporty\". If I said something I thought was funny then people would default to arrogance and assume what I was about to say would be stupid and then look at each other laughing at what I said as if they were embarrassed I was trying to make eye contact with them because I wasn\\'t worth talking to. I would go as far as to say I have a kind of built up hatred towards people in general over my early schooldays. I know my problems stem from my own lack of putting myself into respect, but sometimes one thing leads to another for no particualr reason and you\\'re put in an unfortunate position for the rest of your time in a group and that can scar you for life if you can\\'t move on from it easily. I don\\'t think often about it admittedly, but if I have to think back in my life all my problems started early on like that. I don\\'t trust people and I assume what I do will be unworthy or stupid or cringeworthy before I even try and i don\\'t take risks because I\\'m afraid people will laugh or ridicule me. It\\'s not irrational. That whole \"anxiety is irrational\" crap is bullshit if you have tried being bullied. It\\'s real and there is a consequence that genuinely hurts if you fail and you\\'ve tried it before, and my worst thoughts tell me that I hate a lot of people for not understanding because they\\'re had it incredibly easy. They\\'ve never fallen out in a group and they\\'ve never done something bad which they couldn\\'t then defend or make up for afterwards. They\\'ve not been stuck in a hole without the skills to crawl up again. They can make it seem like anxiety is strange as much as they like and I\\'ll hate them for it just for their lack of understanding. Anyone who\\'s been a victim of anything will have a newfound dislike for a group untouched by those kinds of circumstances. They don\\'t know anything nor could they care about it unless they try it. That\\'s probably the darkest corners of my mind; the thoughts that say to me that I really want \"good\" people to have it bad. I want people to be bullied like I was. It\\'s like a revenge fantasy that I can\\'t put a lid on. I won\\'t like people who have it good.

Like on Pc, AppStore, or Console games. Also, what games do you play? For the gym I can tell you since I\\'ve been doing a lot of research about health, nutrition, and bodybuilding. It all depends on what your goal is like to be just Fit lose couple pounds, To Lose a Ton of weight, or to Gain Muscle. Remember those huge bodybuilders had to start somewhere. What body builders usually do or skinny people is bulk up- eat a ton more then they workout out gain more muscle and strength and then cut- do more cardio eat less to get the sixpack/defined muscles. But you can also do cardio to fill out before you start lifting. If I would have to give couple tips for working out it would be Consistency Diet Not worrying about results You can workout your hardest but if you still eat like shit you will not get results. Now since I told you you shouldn\\'t eat like shit you might ask the question what should I eat? or maybe I can\\'t afford organic or good foods or something along the line. I\\'m going to be a 100 diets will not work for you and when I mean \"Diet\" I mean just going on a diet for couple weeks and then stopping and going back to what you usually eat. You have to make a lifestyle change. That means quitting foods that are making you gain weight and replacing foods that make you not gain weight. I\\'ll tell you straight up what worked for me. Ok here\\'s what I do I would waking up early and then run a mile everyday with empty stomach w/ only water. Then for lunch everyday I ate a salad (Which I hate) and water. Lastly when I got home I ran another mile and for dinner I ate either Starches, Fruits, and Veggies. Sleep is also essential because that\\'s where you lose weight/gain muscle. That would be my \"Diet\" plan to lose weight fast but if you ever want long term results your going to have change your lifestyle/eating habits and either eliminate, reduce, or replace them. I can also give a list of amazing foods and a book that I would 100% recommend for people trying to lose weight. That sounds amazing that you got on a date! It\\'s fine do whatever seems right I would get her talking about her life get to know her more.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'I froze twise while approching a on Ecstasy.. (Long Post) (Need help) This happened yesterday, their was a fest going on in our University and since it was my last fest, i decided to drop Ecstasy. Since our University is located in a rural area their are no proper bars or pubs to drink, so the students have started drinking in a garden which is 50 metres from our University. This was a three day fest and on day two i went out drinking in this garden. I was drinking with my buddies (all guys) and after some time a group of girls from our University came and started drinking besides us. While drinking i noticed that two girls from that group are checking me out. Something about myself:- I am a 21 year old law student in the last year of his course. I have major social anxiety and in my five years at Uni, i have only socialized with a small group of people in my four years in Uni and almost all of them were guys. This was primarily because i got a cultural shock when i moved from a small town to one of the elitist University in India. I am 6ft 2inch with good facial features but a skinny frame. Generally people rate me 7/10. I was decently confident when i started University, but due to my inability to speak fluent English (which is the primary language of conversation in this place) and the highly urban crowd which i had never experienced before, my self confidence was very badly damaged. On top of that i made friends with people who had the same problem of language and culture like me, people who didn\\'t exactly \\'fit\\' in this place. Irrespective, they were pretty toxic and always discouraged and scrutinized any attempts that I made to socialize with people out of our social circle. They would make fun of me for misspranousning words in my presentation and not able to form a coherent sentence when participating in class or speaking to other students. This led to me becoming more and more anxious leading to a total stop by me to try anything or interacting with new people. I just started keeping quiet in lectures and just didn\\'t interact with anyone in the class and made my body language very unnapprochable. This led me getting isolated, loosing my self worth and growing more and more insecure about myself everyday. I started suppressing my opinions and started doing everything which was acceptable by my isolated group of friends. I turned to weed and used to numb myself with it to coupe with the anxiety but the paranoia kept making it worse. I finally started fighting back from my third year and started working on myself. I started getting better at speaking English, learned a lot of new things, got better at studies and putting my opinion forward. I started being more assertive about my boundaries and stopped my friends from walking all over me all the time. But still there is a lot of anxiety, insecurity and an overall inferiority complex. I have only dated one girl in my life which was long distance, we met twice in 3 months and just made out. I don\\'t consider this a proper relationship though. I have a decent amount of good female friends. But it is very difficult for me to talk to a unknown girl, and usually make a fool of myself. I get a decent amount of female attention and a lot of girls have tried to flirt with me but i just get too anxious and awkward. I start overthinking the interaction and always find a way to convince myself that this one isn\\'t right for maybe the next one. However, now i have changed myself and i am trying to actively communicate with girls. I even approached two girls in the gap of six months and got rejected both the times due to very awkward conversation both the times. I have been feeling very lonely for the past 3 years and i crave romantic intimacy. Coming back to story:- After realising that both of them have been glancing towards me, i started making eye contact with the one I was interested in. However, like always i didn\\'t approach her and just left the place after finishing the booze and even give a look back. The next day( last day of the fest) i popped ecstasy and went to the garden with my friends, i started tripping intensely after i reached the party garden. Coincidentally, the same group of girls from day two came and started drinking 20 meters away from us. At this time i had reached my \\'peak\\' of ecstasy and was tripping major nutsack. The high started reducing and got a collected my self a little bit but i was still pretty high, now i start noticing that the same girl from yesterday was again galncing at me in very short intervals, i started making eye contact with her but would break it in 2-3 seconds because of second thoughts. My friends started leaving for college but i was still pretty high so i decided to stay on my own, i started socialzing with people that i knew and all this while me and that girl kept making eye contact. I still wasn\\'t sure weather i should go and talk to her. Then she looked at me for like 10 seconds without breaking eye contact and gave a huge smile. Because of the lowself esteem idiot that i am, i looked turned my neck in both the directions to confirm that she was actually smiling at me. Any other day I would have bounced from that place without approaching her because of my fear of rejection and making a fool out myself but not this time. This time i was on Ecstasy and wasn\\'t feeling my high level of anxiety which generally happens in these kind of situation. I decided I am going to make to make a move this time. I had promised myself in the summer that I\\'ll try and break my virginity in my last year of law school. I waited for an appropriate moment in which she wasn\\'t occupied too much by her friends. I saw an opening and started walking towards her, she was making her drink from the bottle which was on the ground. I stopped 3 ft away from she turned saw me and smiled like she was expecting me. She turned her head again and i just froze. I couldn\\'t utter a word, and after standing there for like 5 seconds without saying anything. I just walked of from their. I cursed by my self for being so pathetic and thought about going back in the college. But i decided to calm myself and try once again because i was really interested in this girl. I smoke a cigarette, muster all the courage and started walking towards her again, this time she was standing with her friend who were both dancing on rap. I stopped she saw me then started looking at her friend. I am feeling extremely nervous right now but i fight it and after 3 seconds i say \" I am sorry for earlier, i just got nervous\" in a very shaky voice. She responded \"it\\'s okay you don\\'t have to worry about that\" in a very soft tone. I ask her name tell her mine then shook her hand. Another friend of her came thinking that i was making her friend uncomfortable. Her friend who came, starts looking at me in a very suspicious way because it could be interpreted by my face that i was on some hard Drugs ( which i think the girl who i approached also figured out) my anxiety shoot up the roof and i wasn\\'t able to utter even an alphabet. I froze again and walked of again, this time for real. I had a very bad trip after this incident and kept cursing myself for being a losser. I seriously need help as to how to overcome my social anxiety and be self- confident, that why i gave a detailed description of myself. I also got to know that the girl i approached is a mutual friend of a guy freind of mine and he has recommended me to send a insta request and start chatting with her.

The funny thing is that I\\'ve already thought I had it around five years ago but I was hesitant (and still am) because \"personality disorder\" sounds like a whole other league than \"only\" anxiety. But the description of it fits me perfectly and much more than SA. I fit all the criteria from both ICD-10 and DSM-5 for AvPD. Just a few days ago I wondered why something like extreme self-consciousness wasn\\'t classified as a disorder. What I think is one of the biggest differences is that I usually don\\'t feel actual fear/panic (with shivering, fast heartbeat, sweating etc.). I\\'ve only had one panic attack so far and it wasn\\'t during a social setting. I\\'m very tense in public, but I wouldn\\'t call it afraid. Like you, I\\'m estranged to my whole family and I even had a close friend who I suddenly couldn\\'t talk to normally anymore, like she was a stranger but she really wasn\\'t. I became suicidal when I was told at an (involuntary) internship that I smiled too little and that people complained about me because of it. I get wasted on days I feel like people dislike me (like when coworkers don\\'t sit down next to me at work, or ignore me when I ask a question).

That summer I worked at a fast food restaurant, whenever I was on the register I would talk to the customers, that was excellent practice, if I didn't feel like talking I could just stick to the script (would you like fries with that) if I did feel like talking I'd chat for a bit while taking there order. I noticed that customers liked talking to me and that helped my confidence in talking. When school started back up I finally started talking to whoever I sat next to, not because I had to, but because I wanted to. TL:DR The only cure is practice and you've listened in on so many conversations that subconsciously your probably an expert in conversations and you've just gotta learn how to apply what you've observed.

Hi, I've noticed I haven't left the house much in the last couple of days apart from to get food, so spend like an hour out the house and then come back. I'm working on Fiverr atm and making quite a lot of money from it, much more then a 9/5 job would give me. And its freelance so I can set my hours etc. I guess my question is a two part thing. The first thing is that i'm aware that my job working from home in my music studio is quite isolating, but also if im more comfortable working this way and am making way more then a 9/5 anyway do I really need a 9/5? I still go out and socialise and see my mates on the weekend at least, but most of my days im alone working and then go out for nights out if im invited. My days atm basically is mostly making music for people all day and then I try and get out for a run or go to the shops for an hour or so in between. But sometimes if my mates don't have work they will invite me to stuff and ill go. Second part of the question is does anyone else do this? like find themselves staying at home a lot. Like say if there's a day where I don't have work to do id still choose to stay at home and chill instead of go and walk around the city aimlessly. Like if I don't have a plan ill just spend my day at home. I don't even view it as an anxiety thing really, im just not great at doing stuff on my own and if I do like I don't really see the point in just aimlessly walking around the city with nothing to do because.... there's nothing to do ahahah.  and#x200B; What do you guys do when your alone and don't have work that day? do u guys stay at home all day and chill also. is this ok to do? assuming you've got work on other days like I do.

            "{'sequence': \"('How social anxiety ruined my life. Hi there reddit, since i am not a native English speaker i'll be using Google Translaitor. I am not seeking for help or life advice i just want to talk. I am 20 and half years old and only now i realised how completely i ruined my life because of the anxiety. And there is no way out for me. As far as I remember myself, I was always a rather shy and closed child, I did not go out outside unnecessarily. My first friends (and the only ones) appeared in my 5th grade. I well remember how we met, it was some kind of event and a couple of guys from my class came up to me and we just started chatting about everything - games, films, football, we chatted for at least two hours and then headed home and exchanged each other with console games. And in my opinion, it was a lot easier to communicate with strangers then. Secondary school, and then in my opinion the first problems appeared. When the homework was a pubic presentation or recitation of a verse by heart, I never completed these homewroks, as a result of which I got F grade and I had to hope only that in future we would no longer have such tasks, I was also afraid to go to the teacher and give me an individual task. In high school, the situation did not change, I was still afraid of public speaking and did not leave home unnecessarily, and when friends called for a walk, I always said that I was busy. A quick fact, in all my life I have never been to a cafe, to the cinema i wasnt even in a store alone. If I needed something, I asked my parents or sister to buy me. In 2016, I passed the exams and entered the pedagogical university at the Faculty of Philology, this was one of the biggest mistakes in my life. Due to the fact that I did not really care about where to go, I had to quickly choose the direction. I had to move from countryside to city (not to far tho, about 130 kms) and learn to live on my own, buy groceries, pay utility bills and most importantly communicate with people, from that moment I no longer saw my friends live, both moved to other cities. Speaking of classes at the university, each English class needed to stand in front of the audience and tell the learned text, there were also quite often group work, and if I could barely cope with the first example, then when we worked in groups I was ready to disappear, run away , do anything if only I were not here, cause i simply cant talk to people which i dont know, My palms and forehead began to sweat. No kidding, when I reached the bus stop and went to the university, for me it was a real challenge. What makes me even more anxious is that there were 22 girls and 6 boys in the group keying me. I went through anxiety for two months until one day I decided not to go to university, and from that moment on, my life went awry. I began to skip classes more and more, sleep problems started, I went to bed at 8 in the morning, and got up at 7 in the evening and my parents didnt even know about this situation. With bad points, but I still went through the first semester. But in the second situation did not change, I was not at the university for exactly a month and none of my classmates, headmen or curator were interested in what happened to me. By the way, in January 2017, I stopped talking with one of my friends, the communication just broke due to some little trifle I don’t even want to mention it. April 2017, the curator told his parents that I did not attend classes, but I in turn made promises that I would attend classes. One day, after a long absence in class, the curator called me to his place and began to ask me what was happening to me, I had good points for the first months of my studies, and then everything went awry. After the conversation, she advised me to turn to a psychologist, but I immediately rejected this idea, although now, I understand that it might be worth giving this idea a chance. Even the girls from the group offered me their help, but I refused, i decided that it will be extremley hard to comeback.I just don’t have the courage to approach the teacher and ask for additional classes. As a result i was expelled from university. While I was in the city alone, I talked a lot about what to do next. They set me up as an example for my sister, laid more hopes on me, but I just didn’t live up to these hopes, I myself was not in awe of myself, I considered myself miserable and that there was no place for me like this in this world, so I decided that the best option there will be suicide. I decided to hang myself in the closet and when I felt cramps and lack of oxygen, a stupid thought crept into my head and said to me “Do not do this, give yourself a chance”. Now, I really regret that I succumbed to that thought and did not finish what it would be worth In September 2017, I entered college and again, in November 2017, I was expelled. Classical history, anxiety, unwillingness to leave the dorm room due to loneliness, although I understand that I had to go to college and university not for communication, but for education. For almost 2 years now I have been living with my parents in the village, I leave the house only to throw snow from the yard, I haven’t been talking with my last friend since January 2019. My younger sister graduated from college, works and receives money, while I just sit on the neck of the parents. Guess, i messed up my life, opportunities, goal and there is nothing i can do about it. I dont watch movies, series, anime, sometimes playing games but right now nothing interests me, i just lay down on the bed and thinking about my pasy and what i have done.

But I grabbed my phone took a picture of them send it to her and told her with a message \"I just saw you And I dont think we can be friends anymore\" and I ghosted her after that I cut all contact with friends of hers and family (first time I ghosted someone). I like to tell myself its no big deal but it really hurts when someone you trust betrays you like that. This event isnt really the reason for my anxiety but it sure made a bit worse I think. I had a rough childhood parents were really aggrasive and both are introverts and when I was diagonesed with anxiety as a kid my parent decided to try not to fight in front of me anymore ( they didnt do a good job at it ) aslo tey started ignoring me becuase they thought they were toxic for me to be around them. So I grow up with introverted parents that argued violently in front of me and isolated me. Afcouse they werent bad parents they did the best that they good. They fucked me up mentally but I didnt starve, I have a home, education I am doing fine so they did great job and I love them for it.\\')', 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with positive effect', 'outdoor activity or space with negative effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect'], 'scores': [0.4388313591480255, 0.3490285873413086, 0.21214011311531067]}\n",

Or he finally decides to throw it to you and sadly the catch is not received.

The rest I would just try to make jokes on them I would feel the anxiety but I wasn’t scared of doing the sports. I was scared of failure and of losing. I was real competitive back then.

I tried reading the card but they couldn\\'t really understand me so my boyfriend had to take the card and read it. I felt embarrassed and just sat there feeling really anxious. I felt so out of place in that moment and I just wanted to escape. I snuck away from the table and sat on the couch by myself and started hyperventilating.

Back in my home country, I did not have this debilitating sense of dread whenever I needed to go outside. I have lived in Asia and went to an international school since the second grade. I had a lot of confidence in myself, as well as a decent group of friends. I still wasn't the most social guy, but I had friends I could relate to. I was able to go to malls, shopping centres, cafes and what not, and converse with the cashier/waitress as a normal person would, although I was a bit awkward. Since then, I've moved to the UK for my undergrad, and man I've basically become a shut-in here. I am too shy to make friends with the local students, I feel like my english despite being good enough is different from the way its spoken in Britain, hence whenever I try to start a conversation, my sentences tend to be incomplete and simply words strung together without a proper structure. My self-esteem has suffered deeply because of this. It's been a year and a half now, and its not getting any better. I'm feeling a mixture of denial and knowing that I shouldn't feel this way because I could function normally back home, as well as anger at myself because I just can't help myself to get out of this condition. I refuse to acknowledge that I have a problem, and I keep looking for reasons as to why I might be the way I am now. Here's how my daily life feels like to me: I leave my apartment complex and walk to university. On my way, I feel that everybody is looking at me, judging me for being so awkward and lame. Once I get to the lecture rooms, people are conversing outside, talking to each other while waiting for class to start. I see people I've talked to before, but for some fucking reason I decide not to make eye contact and sit/lounge around alone. I take out my phone, hoping that nobody notices that I am a loner. I walk into the class, and am greeted by the sight and sound of hundreds of students in this massive lecture hall. I try not to make a fuss about it but I am actually panicking about where I would be able to sit down, without attracting attention to myself. I finally find a place and a couple of people in a group decide to sit next to the empty spots next to mine. They're talking, having a lot of fun, asking each other about how last night's party was and what not. And I'm just there, probably they're oblivious to me even being there. Once lecture finishes, and classes are done for the day, I immediately walk back to my room. This walk back is often filled with bitterness and intense feeling of loneliness, as I pass by other students walking with their friends. The worst part of all this is that I can't figure out why I am the way I am now. Why could I function normally, and live without fear back home but once here I'm afraid of the outside world. I'm afraid of the eyes that aren't probably even looking in my direction, of the laughter I hear around me, thinking that it must be at my expense, while simultaneously knowing that it isn't.

NO. It's not. You don't quite know how I feel. This is more than being shy. It's fear. I have never been one to make a fuss of anything.

I\\'m 14 and I believe is have had social anxiety for pretty much my entire existence so far. Let\\'s take it back to preschool. I remember looking at myself and always thinking \"I\\'m fat\". I know I was young, but I was extremely skinny, but all I saw was fat when I looked down, and actually tried to keep it a \"secret\" from school and my family.i guess the next instance started around 3rd grade. That was the summer after my great grandma died. She used to live next door, and every day I thought about seeing her. She was an amazing woman that I miss so much. After she passed, I felt at loss for quite a while. The year after, bullying started kicking in. I actually became overweight, really saw no difference than before. I was teased for being fat, or stupid, or told I \"liked boys\". I pretty much felt no need for social interactions any time after that. I know I was young, but of course that shit still happens today to me. As of my current situation, doing almost anything social wise is difficult. The best way I can describe it is like a huge amount of embarrassment before the actual event. But it\\'s really worse than I am describing it. It feels like any action I take in some sort of social area (school, restaurant, store, park, ect.) someone there is either watching me do it and thinking badly of me, which I hate, or I am constantly going over in my had be bad things people will say to me. Confrontations are another big issue for me. If I want something, I would rather miss out than ask for it. It makes me feel like I am burdening someone else\\'s life for my own needs, and that they might think badly of me. This ranges anywhere from asking my brother to help me with homework to even just asking someone to point me in the direction of the soup isle in a store. It is also very difficult for me to do anything social wise that could result in me screwing up, even tho 90% of the things that get to me have a 0% screw up rate. This anxiety has gotten to the point where I cannot even enter a grocery store alone out of fear that someone is watching me (although when I am forced to, i always use self checkout) so that is most of my anxiety.

To start things off: i\\'m 21 years old, i\\'ve been a shut-in since i ended highschool (4 years now...) and i\\'m struggling, really hard, to start something up again. Mostly out of anxiety and fear. God .. okay. So i became a shut-in after some personal issues, including trying to figure out what the hell was going on with my life... having a huge fear of failing things and getting nervous about anything social. I remember my mother telling me that it\\'s just shyness in general but i knew that it was way different, it wasn\\'t shyness, it was actual fear. I\\'m always been a little bit afraid of everything that i\\'m doing. An obvious thing is the pressure of being interesting and not a bore around others. Another one is cooking for others: it feels like they expect me to do at least a good job, but if i mess up i get a hard anxiety attack and start crying. And if i\\'m tasked to do something for someone, like a job task, which i\\'m paid for, i think about it in circles before i even do it, and i imagine what things could go wrong, and how i should do it perfectly, or else i picture people around me laughing or making fun out of me. I was kind of teased that way while growing up... Anyways, things like going outside, making phone calls, interacting with strangers all day makes me feel terrified and sick to my stomach. Work makes me anxious. I\\'m absolutely afraid of starting to work, even though i know i should. I feel like a leech to my parents. I just can\\'t bring myself to start working, because it seems to be this huge terrifying place where people are yelling at me what to do, and if i mess up i\\'m going to be punished, in the social sense. I have this screwed up idea of how the world works, even though i haven\\'t been outside... at all. It\\'s like something i rely on and believe is true even if i agree that the world doesn\\'t work that way. It\\'s hard unsticking myself from it... This is rambly. Anyways, the stupid thing is, if i force myself to go outside, and for example, take a walk... then after i\\'m done with it it doesn\\'t feel that bad. I feel, okay, i can handle this, this wasn\\'t as bad as i thought. So clearly i just have to force myself out to experience it even if it wrecks me. It\\'s still really difficult. While inside, shielded from the outside world, a (figurative) voice in the back of my head tells me that the outside world is still scary, and the times i\\'ve been taking a walk doesn\\'t matter. I feel like i\\'m completely submitting myself to the inner fear, \\'ego\\', whatever whenever this happens. It tells me that i should feel scared, and worry about things, and think \"what if\"... it fools me in to thinking that it\\'s for my own best. I can recognize this yet i feel powerless to change it. Until i actually take the first step, which feels like the hardest thing in the universe, and it dissolves right in front of me. I recently did an experiment with my boyfriend, where, when he would be brutally honest and criticize my bad habits (which i\\'m thankful for) i would stop fighting and just \"give up\", something i fear a whole lot. Whenever someone would criticize me, i would feel a need to fight back, in order to prove myself, to not be seen as weak, or whatever. I gave up and admitted that i was wrong, and it gave me such a relaxed feeling that i have never felt before. It felt like i could finally relax my muscles, and stop worrying about what he, or other people thought about me, and as a consequence i didn\\'t feel any social anxiety, or any anxiety for that matter. I think this \\'ego\\' is the root of the problem, making me worry about behaving in a \"good\" way, so that people will like me. This makes sense as when i was a child/teen, people used to avoid me for some reason. So at least i have something to work with. I hate worrying about things way too much, i hate thinking about things in circles before even doing something, i hate thinking i know how it\\'s gonna play out even if it never does. I never am right in my predictions and yet i think it\\'s the safest way to go. It\\'s stupid. I wish i could do something as simple as getting a job, and handle my own life, but i can\\'t.

Here are some things about me: When I'm walking outside in public, WITHOUT a friend, I get self conscious and anxious, which causes me to walk faster and take routes with less busy streets. My main fear when I'm in public is that I will meet or be noticed by someone I know, causing them to make false assumptions about me depending on my location and situation. E.g if someone sees me walking in a bad neighborhood, I'm afraid of them assuming I'm a criminal When I am in public WITH a friend, however, it's much easier and I get less anxiety. I freak out when I am called on by the teacher to read or present in front of the class. When my class is taking turns reading out loud, I will quickly skim through the paragraph before everyone else to prepare in case I get picked to read next When I present to the class, I stutter and can't keep my body still (moving my hands excessively, walking around, etc.) Unless they are my close friends or family, I stutter and tend to look down when I'm having a conversation with another person. I get anxiety when making or receiving phone calls. When I receive a call, I ignore it and later text the person saying that I was busy I reread my emails and make revisions several times before sending them. When I want to say something out loud to another person or a group of people, I repeat the sentence in my head a few times to make sure the wording doesn't sound wrong.

Anyway, here goes: I feel like some kind of imposter here, I haven\\'t been diagnosed with anything, but I know there is something wrong with me. Where to begin... So, I think I could be described as a quiet, shy, introverted (I know being shy and introverted are two different things), and reserved person. I always have been, so far, at least. I\\'m 15. It goes a little further than that though. I\\'m incredibly socially awkward, and I really don\\'t know what to say a lot of the time. If a conversation dies out, I feel like it\\'s all my fault because I\\'m not interesting. I\\'ve avoided Skype calls with a close friend numerous times because of this, and I feel like every time I decline a request to call, they\\'ll stop being my friend. Like they\\'ll hate me or something, even though I know that\\'s bizarre. Also, I have friends I\\'ve met online that I\\'ve known for well over a year now, and I even feel uncomfortable talking in calls with them, so I usually lie and say that I can\\'t talk right now, and just type instead. I also hate going outside, ever since I was a kid. My sister loved(s) going to the park; I didn\\'t want to, I wanted stay inside all day, but my mum made me go. But recently it\\'s gotten worse. A lot worse. I took a day off school two weeks ago. I pretended to be sick. Long story short, I\\'m not exactly in a happy place right now, and I just couldn\\'t go in. Fake smiling, fake laughing - I was sick of it. Then there\\'s also, what I can only presume, are panic/anxiety attacks (quickened breathing, shaky hands, tight throat). Which is kind of why I\\'m here. I\\'ve only ever had one of these (I think) months ago, way back at the start of 2016 in my house. And that sucked like hell. Now I\\'ve started to get them at school. They usually occur just after a maths lesson has finished. I just get this overwhelming feeling of fear, and all I could think was \"What the fuck is wrong with me? I need to get out of here now,\" and \"There\\'s nothing wrong with you, it\\'s all in your head; man up.\" \"Man up\" - that phrase has been drilled into me. After the bell goes and we get to leave, I usually go straight to the toilets in one of cubicles and stay there for 5-10 minutes (during break/lunch break) to calm down. Then I have to leave so I don\\'t look weird and my friend(s) ask me where I\\'ve been. That brings me to today, I pretended to be sick again today to have the day off. Same reasons - unhappy and panic/anxiety attacks. I also feel constantly uncomfortable in social situations (so, all 6 hours of school. Yay), I have a big fear of judgement of others and base my self-worth on that - which is why I have very little of that, but also self-esteem and confidence. I only ever feel normal (mostly) when alone, and even then I\\'m thinking how I have to get up at an absurdly early time in the morning to go to a school I hate and talk to people when I\\'d rather shut myself in all day.

            "{'sequence': '(\\' High school baggage (self-therapy; long rambling). I\\'m trying to work through some stuff in my own head, so no one needs to read or reply to this. I visited my high school on the pretext of seeing the new renovations, but I actually just wanted to feel like I could walk everywhere without fear. Even though I graduated five years ago, I still felt nervous. Even though the school is on winter break and campus was empty, I found myself hesitant to walk where there were usually people. Even five years later, my automatic reaction was to walk away the moment I thought I heard someone and to put on my practiced facial expression as if someone were watching me. I was still scared to walk around campus, but I made myself do it (albeit there was no one there), telling myself that this is my campus too, that I didn\\'t have to run away and that I have a right to be there. High school was about hiding. During lunch, I sat behind pillars and bushes, in bathrooms, classrooms and locker rooms. I walked quickly from class to class with my head down. I stayed in a corner in the library as much as I could. I didn\\'t have a single friend in high school in spite of my initial efforts to reach out to people. I joined a soccer team; I quit because of the name-calling. I joined voice lessons; I quit because of the name-calling. On my first day of class in my first year, someone came to sit next to me, but his friend pulled him away saying loudly, \"I\\'m not sitting next to *her*.\" These were all people I\\'d never met, I was totally new to the school district. In math class, my table group never worked problems with me. Instead, they ignored me, talking to each other in another language, sometimes about me, not even realizing that I understood everything they said. A few times, I tried to sit with people during lunch, people I had met and managed to talk to in a friendly way during class, but they all got up and left together each time. Of course I had to save my dignity and stop acting desperate. From day one, I was marked as a pariah. I don\\'t know why or how I became the constant outcast except that I was new to the district. But for four years, I couldn\\'t eat before or at school. I developed a binge-eating disorder, which still comes up once in a while. I shut down and did nothing but academically-oriented work, never going to a social situation, except prom, which my parents forced me to attend. Those same people I had talked to before said I could join them, probably because it would be rude to say no outright. But of course they walked away and avoided me the whole event. Visiting the high school campus was painful. Objectively, I know that all of this is in the past and that I should be able to move on. But the reality is that the SA that I face every day is in large part due to the ostracizing and name-calling from high school. The past is still a living part of the present. I thought that by visiting campus, I could get some closure. Instead, it\\'s dredged up all the stuff I try not to think about. The only thing I can say is that I can see a bit more clearly what my behavioral pattern is--hiding and making myself as invisible as possible because if they can\\'t see you, they can\\'t hurt you. But I\\'ve gotten so used to making myself as invisible and unobtrusive as possible that I can\\'t make friends. I\\'ve never dated. The one time I mustered the courage to ask a guy to hang out with me, he invited his roommate to join, making it a group activity and proceeded to leave me with her. Writing that out makes me realize how calculated that was; that was actually quite mean. I\\'m always on the defense from people and their attention. But all of this isolation hurts. I\\'m hurting myself in the present because other people hurt me in the past and because I\\'m convinced that people will hurt me in the future. I don\\'t know how I can try anymore.

Here is some more background info for anyone who may be able to give me any good advice, I would really appreciate it. I\\'m a 20 yr old female and I fell in love a couple years ago and moved countries for my boyfriend, we are still together and i believe things are much better than before. You have no idea how hard this move has been on me. I used to be so happy and outgoing and have my close few friends and old high school friends. I used to do my own thing, I used to be so independent. First let me say that I love my boyfriend incredibly and we both plan to spend the rest of our lives together and have a family, build our home and we are already working on our business together. It has been a couple years and I still don\\'t know how to speak the language here. I do not have a car or a drivers license and I work from home. I feel I am so reliant on him for everything. I feel I am so needy and attached to him always. We spend every day together and yes we take our space but I wouldn\\'t want it any different. Now with the crime etc here and with how I stand out we both aren\\'t comfortable with me taking the bus let alone running in the area we live. This is another problem. I know a group of people that speak English and we sort of get along but I feel no matter what I do not click with any of the girls here. I have always had troubles being friends with girls though, they don\\'t seem to take a liking to me and I\\'ve accepted that and continue to be as nice and genuine as possible. I used to have a bunch of guy friends but now that I am in a serious relationship ( I should note this is my first relationship ) I don\\'t think that it is very appropriate to make close guy friends but I get along well with my boyfriend\\'s friends though. With the language I\\'ve been excusing it and excusing it and Now that I live here I feel I have become shy because I hate being laughed at for not knowing the language, I get so much anxiety when we are out and there is lots of people and my boyfriend is talking to people I don\\'t seem to recognize or know, or even people I do know and it\\'s in their own language and I just close in and feel so alone and so invisible to everyone. I try to learn a bit but guess I get frustrated and shut down easily. I am forcing myself to pay for 1on1 private lessons though and I feel this is a huge block that is one of the main problems for me. I hate being the center of attention as well and I think that I am a very insecure woman now that I am in this relationship. The way I think about myself can at times be terrible, I\\'m great for overthinking and my poor boyfriend gets to deal with it all. I know that from a young age because of dad issues or whatever I have abandonment problems and although I think my boyfriend would never and know that he has never done anything behind my back involving another woman I still feel like I will lose him at times and I feel like i am not good enough. As you can probably tell I have serious insecurities about myself, what I believe are abandonment issues, social anxiety, a language barrier, I am too dependent on him, uncomfortable to walk the streets alone, a hard time making friends, a hard time even going out of my comfort zone, sometimes suffer from bouts of depression etc and it is hard on both me and my boyfriend. I broke down yesterday because I was holding it all in for so long and I didn\\'t want my boyfriend to know because honestly he is so used to me crying I feel like it doesn\\'t even phase him but he came in the room and I couldnt hide it anymore and he actually cried with me because he couldn\\'t believe how I was feeling about myself etc. But today we went to an event and it was so overwhelming for me there was so many people and I started panicking inside and tried to keep it to myself but he sensed it and then as we were leaving I asked if he wanted to get a beer before we went to this other event (work) and he said no and that we had to go to that event right away but then he saw his friend opened a bar and we went to say hi and the guys completely ignored me and they all talked to eachother in their language and again it hit me and I felt so worthless to be standing there just looking at the ground trying to keep it together and then he asks me if we can have a beer with them and that stung because I just got turned down when I asked. We ended up leaving anyway and he noticed I was a little upset and I asked him about the beer thing and the friends who wouldn\\'t even look at me and then he started getting pissed off and He makes this comment \"why can\\'t we go just one day without it turning bad \" and I started crying and there was a point I was upset with him and said fuck you and had a short rant and he said \"you don\\'t even try to get better\" \"I don\\'t deserve this\" \"I can\\'t even say hi to my friends\", he totally lost his cool and was yelling and speeding at times and I just kept fucking crying, he also asked why for once I can\\'t make it all about me and even though i feel he took things way too far I understand and I feel like a peice of shit and am so upset with myself.

            "{'sequence': \"('What is it?. Hi, I'm a 22 year old male from the UK. It has just hit me that I might be suffering from some form of social anxiety. I know it's not something you can easily diagnose, as being shy is common and often just a stage in someones life, but I think it's more than shyness for me. I can speak to other people fine, and will smile at the barista or laugh with somebody if the situation is so, so I wouldn't class myself as shy. I can hold a conversation with a stranger well enough. What I think is my problem is that I always feel like I have to prepare myself before I go out. Regardless of how well I think I'm dressed, or whether I have a fresh haircut or whatever, I feel unready to be in the gaze of others if I'm not physically and mentally prepared. If I don't know that I'm being looked at/am in the presence of others or if I'm not prepared mentally to be looked at/to be in the presence of others, I feel very uncomfortable. Don't ask me what my mental preparation is, because I have no clue. My physical preparation is fairly normal for a young male, it's just the mental side. I also just always feel like I'm being watched when I'm walking in public. Like everyone I pass stares at me for a second longer than they do at other people, because I don't fit in. Truth is, I look 'normal'. I'm from an ethnic minority, but who the hell cares about that (especially at uni). I don't think I look particularly attractive or unattractive. The issue came to fruition in Uni, when I began to be out and about more generally. I was a bit overweight, but not by majorly so, and my self-consciousness with that made me hate being in public. I'd want to be out of sight as soon as possible, and it was like a massive burden was lifted off my shoulders when I'd reach my room. Since then I've lost a lot of weight so that I'm really like any other young adult male (if a bit on the skinny side, but that's because I'm into running), and yet the feeling of being out of place still hasn't changed. I'm still at uni (in my final year), and it has improved a lot. Losing weight helped, and generally becoming more comfortable with how I look. I think that was one of my major problems. I was very self conscious with my looks. I hated the way I looked with glasses because I thought it made me look even weirder, to the extent that I wouldn't wear glasses when my prescription is such that I should wear them all the time. I'd rather be basically blind and live in a blur than to look that extra bit weirder. That continued on for a long while, until I realised that it was affecting how people I knew thought of me because they'd pass right by me or wave at me and I'd blank them because I couldn't see them. That's different now, I think I've come to terms with my image. I look different, but I'm fine with that because we all do, and I'm no beast or whatever. I'm a lot more comfortable in public too and will go out even when I don't particularly need to, but there's still that something that makes me falter before I go out in the morning, and sometimes I don't even want to leave my room. That is what has made me think that there's something more to my condition than just having body image issues. There's no better feeling than getting back into my room and being out of sight after a long day at uni. I read somewhere that this is just a symptom of being an introvert, but I don't think I am your usual introvert. I enjoy meeting new people, and sometimes I really crave it. It's not social interactions that exhaust me, because I get this need to hide away after simply being out and having not even talked to anyone. So is this the right place for me? Do you think I have social anxiety issues? I don't think it is the body image issues that I've had in years gone by, but then again I've never really looked for professional help for anything like this. I don't know.. honestly I'd just be glad if there was someone else who had the same issues, someone that I could to talk to about them? Thanks for reading all of that. It's the first time I've ever actually typed out my feelings about it, and really is a relief in itself, so thanks for being a part of that even if there is nothing you can suggest.')\", 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with positive effect', 'outdoor activity or space with negative effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect'], 'scores': [0.36659958958625793, 0.3216173052787781, 0.3117830753326416]}\n",

            "{'sequence': '(\\'22M, live abroad is killing me. Hello reddit, I moved to Europe, when I was 14. My mother already lived there for 3 years and I lived in Ukraine with my grandparents. I was never really asked if I wanted to move but I also didn\\'t think about living in other country and leaving everything behind as a big problem. First half of the year was a horror. I spoke to almost no one. I learned German for a year prior to moving to Europe and it was not enough for me to instantly make friends. Also, the last couple of years at school in Ukraine were pretty difficult for me, as I was constantly bullied. I was weak and skinny and didn\\'t know how to protect myself. But even then, I didn\\'t have any other problems outside school. So, back to Europe, from my first days here, I tried to speak to my new schoolmates as good as I could. But I also started to shield myself from people. Like, if I try to look unfriendly or dangerous, nobody will try to make fun of me. I behaved myself like this, when I was in public. It\\'s not, like I was being impolite to people, but I tried to always have this \"don’t mess with me look\", if this makes any sense. However, knew country, new rules. I didn\\'t have to be afraid of being attacked physically. Instead I couldn’t argue or counter jokes from my classmates. This time I was vulnerable not, because I was weak, but because I didn\\'t know the language well. I also went to a second school simultaneously. My week looked like this: twice a week a returned home at 8pm, because of two schools, where I hadn\\'t time to go home between them. The rest of time I had to study. My first winter holidays, which I spent back in Ukraine, were both a relieve and a horror. I had to go privately to a German teacher almost daily. In first summer I had about 3-4 teachers to prepare me for both schools. All this was awful, but stilly I had my friends at home and was overall happy. **Until one day it started.** I was going back from my German teacher (who was a really nice person, and who taught me really a lot grammar, that helped me immense with my German, so it\\'s not like I totally hated learning German). But let\\'s go back. So, I was going back from my \"class\". I was a usual way for me: just a bit uphill along the road towards the bus stop. Suddenly it was more difficult for me to breath and I felt like, if I would start breath more, people would notice it and, that I looked really awkward. After that, I drove back home and felt myself completely normal. But this situation repeated itself more and more during that summer. I started to notice the way I breathe even on my way to the teacher. I think, this is where it all started. As I was back in Europe, I started being conscious about how I move my feet or my arms. I was always aware of where I was looking at, how my lip was positioned. I didn\\'t know how to look in people\\'s eyes, whether I looked unfriendly etc. I still had no friends at European school, I haven\\'t had any walks which I had constantly with my friends back in Ukraine. It looked like the kids where either going out the way I didn\\'t understand or the didn\\'t do it at all. Years went by, the only time I enjoyed my life, was when I had winter or summer holidays and was back in Ukraine. There I could talk to people, I even managed to make new friends, with whom I still have good contact. I just felt myself normal. After about 2-3 years later, I managed to tell my mother, that something was wrong with me. (It\\'s not easy for a kid to admit, that something is wrong with his head! And I didn\\'t have a good connection to my mother at that time) She took me to her psychiatrist. I was prescribed with some weak antidepressant. I guess I helped with my mood a bit, but it had done shit to my social anxiety. I just tried to suppress the way I felt and had from time to time breakdowns. My only dream was to finish school and University and leave that fucking country. Since no one here needed me, I decided, I would manage everything on my own. I finished both schools. It may sound like it isn\\'t bad after all. Well, no. All this time it felt like I lost that autopilot and had to manually control the way I move, or where to look at the person I speak to. I still didn\\'t feel connected to people around me. I could not make jokes, which the class would find funny. I didn\\'t speak to anyone outside my class. I felt isolated and people around me perceived me the same way. I wasn\\'t interested in my future carrier or, in what to study. My only dream was to leave this country. Instead of leaving, I thought, that it would be a waste to give up an opportunity to study in Europe. I also didn\\'t want to disappoint my relatives. And, to be honest, I was afraid to change anything, go back home and take exams to be able study there. I also didn\\'t want to look like an idiot, coming back, when everybody else wanted to leave Ukraine for better future. I think, I should have done that. If not for studying, but just to have a year off, relax, get rid of SA and may be come back to study. (It\\'s important to mention, that most of the social anxiety symptoms weaken, after I get back home for, at least a month. But even from the first day on, I always felt myself a lot better ) But I haven\\'t done that. Instead I thought, I could power myself thought University, get a bachelor and leave this fucking country forever. I tried studying two different faculties, I hoped, that at the University I would finally able to connect to new people and have fun (so that I would even decide to stay in Europe). That never happened. I tried to study mechanical engineering, but from the beginning the math was just unmanageable for me and I couldn’t find a group to study together. Well, if I can\\'t have fun talking to someone new, since I am to anxious, I can\\'t fit in a group to study, because you must speak there and, like, make friends :) In Europe there are no persistent classes at the Universities. You either have a lection in a huge auditorium or have smaller classes, with 20-40 persons for something like practicing math, where you must solve your prepared homework in front of whole group. I had to do it twice and I felt almost like I am fainting. The most time I spent at home, where I didn\\'t have to feel constant fear and be in fight or flight mode. During one summer in Ukraine I met my current girlfriend. Later, I decided to study CS at a so-called University of Applied Science, where after three years of fixed classes I would have my bachelor and could go back to Ukraine. I had to wait almost a year to sign me up for that University. In the meantime, I found a job, where I am basically all levels of support and a junior sysadmin at same time. (Back in European school a had a specialization in IT because of which we had one year more of school. And the specialization made me hate IT so much, that I didn\\'t realize, that I actually like it) The job was fantastic the only \"problem\" was, that every year in August they organized an event for different political, technical, economical, etc topics) and I had to be there for month. During that time I had both to do IT Stuff and help prepare everything for the conference (cheap student labor :D) But that one month of constant work (not 8/5) just crushed me. My anxiety escalated to some new levels, I was constantly stressed. I was still extra anxious after work but also looked forward to study something I wanted, the way I thought could be the best for me. I expected, that only mathematics would be hard for me, but I also knew you that it would not be as difficult as in a normal University. I was so fucking wrong about everything. The amount of information was huge. We had constant projects in most of the classes. Moreover, there are supposed to be a lot of group projects. The groups where created all by themselves. I didn\\'t want to be that person without a group and be assigned to somebody I didn\\'t like. All of this made me extremely anxious. Additionally, to my social anxiety I became anxious about everything else. I had to finish every assignment, otherwise I would fail either the final project or the test and then after 3 repeat I would have to repeat the semester. And if you didn\\'t manage to do the first assignment, you will still have to do it, since every next assignment is built upon previous. But most important, I could not manage to make social contacts. I was truly afraid of people. It seems, like we have no similar interests. I still do not know how to connect to them. People in Europe just feel so alien to me. Here in Europe, at my University I felt like a totally different person. I had a lot of breakdowns, I started to cry in the evening and I somehow managed to survive till end of the December and have two weeks off, during which I had to prepare for math exam. But still I was in Ukraine with my girlfriend. What was really killing me is, that I still can perfectly speak to my Ukrainian friends, we can argue, discuss stuff, make fun of each other etc. I have a very nice and understanding girlfriend. I have no problems socializing with them. Or even with meeting new people in Ukraine. After final exams my girlfriend was here with me in Europe, and I still could not relax. When we were in public I constantly was afraid, that I cannot protect her, due to my SA. I also failed two exams and had to retake them after holidays, which made me even more anxious. My doctor gave me some new medication, which, for two weeks seemed to lower my social anxiety and it felt awesome. I already lost my belief that there could be any meds that could really help me. And that belief was restored. The only thing I feared, is that it won\\'t hold, like with all previous things that seemed to help me. And, well, it didn\\'t hold. Something happened during the weekends, I can\\'t explain what it is. But it set me off. My fear became true. The amount of work for the University increased even more and became unbearable to me. At this point I cry for hours. Last week I spent home, constantly anxious. At this point, I don\\'t know what to do. I should have left this country for a year after school. Now I feel, like I can\\'t do it. I also feel, like I am already too old to stop studying and make a pause. I don\\'t think, that I will be able to finish this semester, since I have already fallen behind all the classes. I also get very anxious if I try to study and more anxious after every minor difficulty. My relatives think, that it wasn’t that bad previously. I think, I just was very good at suppressing it and just can\\'t take it anymore. When I felt myself worse, I was usually prescribed new medication, talked to the therapist. After that I felt a bit better and it was enough to continue suppressing and working on \"more\" important things. How long can a person live in a foreign country feeling lonely? I know, that there are people, to whom I am interesting, who like me and care about me. My family is also very supportive. But it\\'s not them, who feel anxious about going outside. It\\'s me who is constantly afraid of masses of people, who can\\'t relax outside and can\\'t protect myself from. Any verbal or nonverbal assault. It almost feels like I am at a warzone. I remember, when I didn\\'t care, how people look at me, ignored if somebody was rude to me. I was able to respond the way I wanted. My head wasn\\'t empty. Now I just slowly fall apart. I am not suicidal, I guess, because I don\\'t believe in the afterlife and am afraid of death. Hell, I even was more relaxed during this two weeks in Ukraine in winter. It wasn\\'t enough time, but I felt myself free on the streets. You probably gonna say, why the hell wouldn\\'t I leave. I know, people would support my decision, I could probably come back later. But I don\\'t won\\'t to let down my girlfriend, even if she says, I don\\'t. I didn\\'t finish a university, so nobody would really want to have me work for them and I want to work, so that I won\\'t be an abuse. I know my options. I just don\\'t have the will to make a decision. I feel like I would get better a bit, like usual and would continue ignoring the problem and maybe in 5 years will slowly finish CS at the University. I just don\\'t think, it is going to be a life. Maybe you together with my girlfriend, it would be easier. I don\\'t know, why am I even writing this. I don’t know, whether it’s a right subreddit. Even posting something on the internet makes me anxious. I do not know, what I want to hear from you. Therefore, I will just share this story and hope for something. I also hope, I won’t be deanonymized by somebody. I just feel, like for the last 8 years, I lived only episodically, not being able to open my true potential or take the opportunities, I was given. And I feel like I am slowly going insane. I hope, that this text isn\\'t totally unreadable, since I guess, English is not even my second language . I tried to keep it as short as possible, but I also don’t expect, that anybody would like to read almost 3k words text. **TL;DR** A lot of autobiographical stuff. Moving abroad as a kid literally ruined my nervous system as the years passed by. And my will was never strong enough to decide, what is really important for me and to change my life the way I really wanted. Now, I just can\\'t take my social anxiety anymore and overcome any difficulties of being an adult. The difference between, who I am in one country, and who I am in another is just killing me.\\')', 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with negative effect', 'outdoor activity or space with positive effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect'], 'scores': [0.33367204666137695, 0.33342066407203674, 0.3329073488712311]}\n",

            "{'sequence': \"('My Social Anxiety. I wrote this as a bit of a vent for myself but thought I would post it here because I’m sure many of you can relate to this. It’s a bit long but here goes... As a kid I was always “shy.” I wouldn’t make direct eye contact with people most of the time. I would put my head down in situations where I had to meet new people. At family gatherings I would mostly keep to myself only talking to people if they asked me a question. Even then, it would usually be a short response. In school I didn’t have many friends. I had more in elementary than I did in middle school. More in middle school than in high school. I can count the number of real friends I had in high school on one hand. It sure didn’t help that I went to three different high schools throughout my high school years. One of those I left and returned to a few times. I changed elementary schools in the 4th grade, and then changed middle school in the beginning of 7th grade. So it didn’t make it any easier to make friends with people that already had established groups of friends that they had grown up with. I remember hearing this girl in my class talking to her friends about how it was weird that we keep leaving and coming back. (We being my sister and I) In high school people thought I was rude or mean because I didn’t talk to anyone. The truth is I just didn’t know how. I wanted to have friends. I didn’t want to be popular or anything but who doesn’t want to have their own circle of friends and people to relate to? Even the people I “dated” didn’t get to know the real me because I was too afraid to be myself. I don’t know why I felt this way. I’m sure it has something to do with my developmental years but I’m not an expert. Going to school every day was hell. Thinking that everyone is judging you all the time or talking about you or laughing at you is rough. Being made fun of for being “too skinny” or “too quiet” or “too rude” is rough. I would walk in every morning with headphones in and make a beeline for the classroom and I would leave the same way. I wonder if you know what this social anxiety feels like? It can come and go at anytime. Some days are worse than others. Some days it’s insomnia, heart racing, palms sweating, mind racing. It’s uncontrollable and it feels like you’re mind is going to explode from the craziness inside it. Some days it lurks in the background. On those days it’s manageable. You can go to the movies or to the mall and feel somewhat okay. Some days it’s canceling plans you’ve had for weeks because you just can’t bring yourself to leave the house and face human interaction. You can’t face the feeling of everyone’s eyes on you and the negativity that you assume is associated with you. You can’t force yourself to act like you’ve got it together in front of other people. It’s too hard to put on a smile and make conversation. The hardest part for me is self doubt. I’m always second guessing what I’m doing. Always thinking someone is watching. Always afraid of messing up. It’s also people thinking I’m lazy because I don’t work and when I do it never lasts too long. Even the job I have now which is a good job with good pay, it’s hard. It’s hard forcing myself out of bed in the morning knowing for the next twelve hours I’m going to be mentally exhausted which is much worse than the physical exhaustion. That may seem like an over statement to you but it’s not for me. Walking down the long walk ways at work hoping no ones walking the opppsite direction. What do I do when I cross someone’s path? Do I make eye contact? Do I look straight ahead? Do I smile? Nod? Wave? Am I rude if I just look down or away? These are all thoughts going through my head. As irrational as they are, they’re real. What happens when everyone is standing in a group talking? Do I go and try to be part of the group? But then I have to talk to people. But if I don’t I just look like a weirdo or like I think I’m too good to talk to them. What if I think I know how to do something at work but I’m not sure and I’m afraid to mess up so I ask someone for help? Then I feel dumb because I should’ve just done what I thought was right in the first place. Sometimes I avoid doing things altogether just so I can’t fail and look dumb in front of my co workers. But doing nothing also makes me look lazy and like I’m not a team player. Do you understand the problem? This is also the reason I don’t drive. I know I’m capable of driving and would probably enjoy it, but I’m terrified of taking the driving test. I can’t bring myself to go and be on the spot like that. I don’t even want to drive in front of my fiancé so how am I supposed to do it for a test in front of a stranger? Everyone tells me you need to get your license. It’s such an obvious and easy thing for everyone else but for me it’s the hardest thing in the world. It’s the same reason I wouldn’t cut the grass when I was younger. I didn’t want people to watch me out in the front yard anyone passing by could and I didnt want to mess up and cut it poorly. I hope this will help you understand what this anxiety is like for me. It’s not getting better. In fact it’s gotten worse. I’m getting more general anxiety now. Unreasonable worrying about things I have no control over. Checking to see if my loved ones are still breathing when they sleep or worrying about getting into car accidents. Living with this anxiety is getting harder and harder. All I want to do is give up and just lay in bed at home in a safe place all the time. I’m looking into getting help because this is too much to handle and I just want to feel normal for the first time in my life.

However this incident has made my anxiety worse, and I\\'ve never really recovered since. When I was young, I used to always be a teacher\\'s pet. Teachers used to love me, and I was always their favorite student. I used to always get special acknowledgment from teachers because of this. In 8th grade (2010-2011 school year) I had a history teacher. At the beginning of the school year he would acknowledge me and give me attention. However, one day after lunch I was walking to his classroom to get to his class. I was down the hall and he was at the door. I guess I was walking a little slow and he yelled, \"Devin hurry up!\". (Looking back on it he didn\\'t even say it in an angry way and I\\'m mad at myself for letting that get to me.) Ever since that incident I felt like he was mad at me and he didn\\'t like me. Because of this I was always desperate for his approval again. However, I never got it! He never acknowledged me or called on me in class ever! He would acknowledge all of his students except for me. I would stare him down in the hallway or in his classroom hoping he would say something to me, but he never did. I didn\\'t like how every one else got attention from him except for me. I even raised my hand once in his class to answer a question, and he looked at me and didn\\'t call on me! All I wanted was his approval. I have never been treated like this by a teacher before, so it was hard for me to take. I was so used to being a teacher\\'s favorite student. He pretty much ignored me the entire school year. Because of this incident, I\\'m now desperate for approval from everyone! When I go shopping I get upset when an employee chooses to acknowledge the person I\\'m with and not me. When people choose to acknowledge someone else over me I get jealous! I struggle making eye contact with people! I\\'m very sensitive to how people look at me and what people think about me! It\\'s hard for me to relax in public! It\\'s like I want approval from everyone! If I don\\'t get it I get upset and feel like there\\'s something wrong with me. Before the incident with my History teacher, I never had these issues! I\\'m so upset because I feel like if it wasn\\'t for that situation, my anxiety wouldn\\'t be so bad now and I wouldn\\'t have all these issues. Ever since this incident, my anxiety has been horrible! My anxiety was never this bad prior to this incident. I just feel like I will never be the same person I was before 8th grade. I still had anxiety, but I was able to enjoy life more and interacting with people didn\\'t make me so anxious. Now my anxiety is debilitating. Every time I go outside I instantly get nervous. When people look at me or when cars drive by me I get uncomfortable. I just feel like I will never get better and I\\'m going to spend the rest of my life being a people pleaser with crippling anxiety.

Hello, This is going to be a little long, but please take the time to read this. I don’t know what to do. I’m not trying to gain sympathy or pity, I just need to pour my heart out. I’m 20. I’m a boy. I have social anxiety. It’s something I struggled with my whole life. In school I was always quiet because I was very shy. Students used to always ask me “Why are you so quiet?” Teachers would call my parents and tell them “Your son is very quiet.” My parents would get mad at me because of it. When we would visit family, I was always quiet and in my shell. They would ask me, “Why are you so quiet? You can open up.” I was always shy and uncomfortable around family I didn’t see very often. My father always scolded me after we visited his family for being so quiet and acting uncomfortable around them. I spent a lot of time in the house. My father never liked that. He always wanted me to go outside and play with the other kids in the neighborhood, but I never wanted to out of fear. He would always give me a hard time for always being alone and not having friends. He would say, “You’re always alone, you have no friends.” I know I don’t have any friends and I’m always alone. It was very hurtful to listen to him and hear that, but he’s right. The truth hurts. He still says it to this day. I would talk to people in school, but I would never hang out with them outside of school. I couldn’t take that next step. And people never wanted to hang out with me anyway. They would never ask me if I wanted to hang out with them. They never asked for my phone number. I could never open up to people. I was always awkward and uncomfortable with other students in school. They definitely picked up on that. I went to the same school district since third grade, and I don’t have a single friend from there. My anxiety hit rock bottom out of nowhere during my freshman year of high school. It could be attributed to the fact I was going through puberty and my hormones were raging or it just progressively got worse. I started developing so many issues that were not a problem prior. I started having a hard time making eye contact with people. Being sensitive to how people look at me. If I get dirty looks from someone or a weird look, I feel like something is wrong with me and I’m devastated. When I’m out for a walk and someone is approaching me I either put my face down and look at the ground to avoid eye contact or I try to make the effort to make eye contact with the passerby, but they just look at me funny and I feel awkward. Going out for car rides and feeling like people in other cars are looking at me and judging me. Going out for walks with other people around. People noticing that I’m nervous or uncomfortable and judging me for it. Walking into a room full of people with all eyes on me. Always feeling like people are staring at me and judging me. Just so many issues that became so severe. I always had anxiety, but during my freshman year of high school my anxiety got much worse. Prior to this, my anxiety wasn’t that bad. I was more care-free. It was easier for me to interact with people. I was able to enjoy life more. The issues I started developing weren’t much of an issue in the past. I became so upset that my anxiety gotten worse. I let my mind convince myself that I’m never going to get better. I’m doomed to have social anxiety for the rest of my life. I’m never going to be able to go back to how I was before my freshman year of high school. Going out period around other people became too anxiety inducing for me, so I became a shut-in. I went through the rest of high school with debilitating anxiety. During sophomore year, I started eating lunch in the counseling office because eating in the cafeteria with all the other students became too overwhelming for me. I always walked with a book in my hand for a comfort. I was and still am very self-conscious of the way I walk. People say I walk very stiff or like a robot. Going to school everyday made me extremely nervous. Sitting in the classroom amongst other students and feeling like everyone is staring at me. Walking the hallways. Giving presentations. High school was hell. However I made it through and I graduated. I started college and I didn’t have the college experience. I struggled with anxiety. I just stayed in my dorm all day and did nothing. I didn’t make any friends, join any clubs/organizations, party, etc. I was too afraid to open up. I was too afraid to step outside of my comfort zone and make friends and just have fun. People would try to be my friend, but I was never comfortable. Everyone around me was having the time of their lives, making friends, etc. It was depressing because I wasn’t having any of that. I don’t even want to go back to school next year. I have no life. I just sit in the house all day everyday. I don’t work because I’m too afraid to get a job. How am I going to get through the interview? What if my coworkers won’t like me? What if my manager won’t like me? What if customers or my coworkers think I’m weird because I’m socially awkward? I try to get out of the house, but being out just makes me nervous. I want to have friends and I want to have a life. I feel like I have so much to offer, I just need to get past this awful fear. I go on social media and look at people I went to school with. They are having the time of their lives while I sit on my behind and do nothing. It’s upsetting. I have no personality. I feel like a robot. Everytime I interact with people in public I’m very stiff and robotic. People tell me I’m extremely nice, but honestly I feel like I have no personality. I can’t open up to people. I’m never comfortable and I’m always on edge. I’m living in fear. I just feel like I’m doomed to have social anxiety for the rest of my life. It has gotten so severe to the point where I don’t think I can ever recover. Sorry for the long post, but I needed to pour my feelings out. I’m sick of people telling me I’m just a lazy bum.

One, frack you guys who say “just get over it”, you’ve probably never dealt with anxiety, it’s like you are carrying the weight of everyone’s judgements and eyes on you with every possibility of any and every event running through your head all the time. It’s traumatic and we live with it everyday and in the end some of us can’t take it any longer, we can’t stand the pressure of living under the umbrella of our own minds. Two, you think I’m not dealing with it? I’ve done therapy, I’ve had over half a dozen different therapists and psychologists, I’ve done the meds and meditation and I still spent over half my junior year of high school locked in my bedroom crying and trying not to end it while my mother thought I just had mono and was “tired”. I am trying, I force myself outside and to interact but it’s terrifying and people just don’t seem to get that. When you’ve lived your whole life with these voices in your head telling you that you’re useless, you’re worthless, that no one likes you or that you’ll mess everything up, it’s hard to just shut it out. They echo all the time; you want to go out for ice cream, they’ll tell you people will think your ice cream choice is weird or you’ll drop the cone all over you or on someone else. Rinse wash and repeat with any and every social situation. Yeah I’m getting better, I’m moving forward.

All of these issues I still struggle with today. However, the most severe out of them is my anxiety. I worry over everything; no matter how big or small. The most insignificant thing can send me off in a fit of nerves and panic. I’m plagued with what ifs constantly. I’ve avoided social events because of anxiety. Most of my daily life is fucked up due to anxiety. My anxiety stems from the root of being afraid of messing up. As a kid, I taught myself to be a perfectionist; if I did everything perfectly I wouldn’t get in trouble. If I did everything right and was perfect inside and out, then my parents and friends and family wouldn’t have to worry about me. This has had a disastrous effect. I can’t go outside due to being so nervous of fucking up, doing something stupid, looking dumb, etc. I’ll get this knot in my stomach just thinking about going out with friends. I can’t talk to new/ somewhat familiar people because I get nervous that I’m not talking right or looking stupid or saying the wrong thing or just being overall disinteresting. Anything outside of my daily routine of work/school/home fucks me up. This also relates to new experiences. I’m scared of dating. I’m scared of sex. Whenever I think about these things I get this extreme burning sensation, a heavy fit of nerves, and I have to calm myself down because it gets so intense. I hate going on vacations because I get the what if’s and at the end of the day I just count down to the day I can be back in the safety of my own home. It’s killing me. I hate myself at the fact I can’t do regular things. I don’t have fun. My life is so mundane and basic that it frustrates me, but the anxiety and fear of the outside is what keeps me isolated. I can’t go places. I can’t talk to people. I can’t make new friends. I can’t live my life. I can’t take it anymore. It’s not even the fact that I won’t do it, I physically cannot do it. And it’s not like I can just shove myself out there. I’ve done that before and it’s just made everything worse. I’ve tried going out with a close friend and I hated it so much I just wanted to go home.

I've sought help from others online, from self help videos and books to personally researching mental illnesses and finding strategies to combat it, but nothing has helped. It continues to grow worse and worse.

Both mentally and physically. Really, what I want to do is see a therapist. An online one. I've tried everything I can on my own, but maybe talking with a therapist online could help me with my anxiety at least to a point where I can get myself outside to go to a doctor and a therapist in person.

Having suffered from it since I was 15, I understand how debilitating it can be to just go outside and how the fear before just doing the simplest of tasks can make you feel. I am making this post because, although I know this subreddit tends to be mainly memes and jokes, and I love it for that, we do all share one common thing - we all suffer/do suffer from social anxiety. And for many, this post will be useless, but when I first subscribed to this subreddit, I’d never done anything significant to truly address and deal with my mental health. I had a feeling of hopelessness that I no longer have, and if I could go back in time and give these words to myself, I would. If this post can help just one person, then I’ll be happy! But right, in the last year, I met a girl. I struggle with going to University, but I need a future. She made me NEED to get better, and I wish I had the self control to make MYSELF force myself to take steps in getting better. I know for a fact there is someone reading this who hasn’t taken these steps to try and improve their social anxiety, because the social anxiety itself prevents people from doing so. Getting help involves speaking to say, a doctor, or a therapist, and this can be a massive, scary deal. So, with having social anxiety, it can be tremendously difficult to take the first steps to recovery. This is unique, in that suffering from a mental disorder such as OCD or depression doesn’t necessarily restrict you seeking help in the sense of being unable to get yourself, on your own, to see a doctor or a therapist. However, you have to want to get better. You have to know that you deserve better, that social anxiety is NOT normal, is NOT something anyone should suffer with, and that it IS a strongly researched mental health disorder which is legitimate and known by every health professional. You need to enforce this desire, and you have to make a doctors appointment. This will create a dialogue with your GP. You have to see what support is there for you. Your GP speaks to hundreds of people every week, with a whole host of different issues, both physical and mental. Mental health is a massive public health issue and is finally being treated as such. SEE. YOUR. DOCTOR! Doing this was the best thing I ever did, even though I was terrified when I had my first appointment. I am not ashamed to admit that I had some alcohol before going, thought about cancelling in the week leading up to the appointment and was just downright terrified of going. But I did, I said that I had anxiety, in social situations, and guess what - he understood. Doctors. Don’t. Judge. I was put on a small dose of medication - was a bit weird for the first few days, as it made me lose my appetite and feel a bit weird, but it settled. You don’t notice the affects of anxiety medication too much, it takes about 6 weeks for it to have any affect. It’s likely you’ll also have your dose increased after your body settles on it. It can feel like a long process, you just want to stop having these feelings of anxiety, of dread, of fear going somewhere and having the physical symptoms of your anxiety presenting themselves and embarrassing you. But it’s just the first step to getting better - medication CAN work. Some say it doesn’t work for them, but it definitely makes some difference for some, and I am living proof of that. Next - therapy. I wouldn’t have been able to do a single therapy session if it weren’t for medication. Some will be able to, and if you are, great. Secondly, money. I live in the UK, and here the NHS offer therapy for free if the patient needs it, so I’m lucky in that sense, although the waiting list was 3 months. I am aware that in many countries, therapy isn’t cheap. However, even where money is tight, please realise that your mental state is so important, and is ABSOLUTELY worth spending money on in looking to improve it. Social anxiety is not normal, and is not something you should have to be subject to every day. You deserve to get professional help. For those who literally cannot afford therapy, I sincerely apologise and ask you to see if there is anything you can do to get the help you need. Therapy is scary, at first. But it’s also the best thing I’ve forced myself to do. You become familiar and comfortable with a therapist. They understand social anxiety, they put you at ease and remind you that this is their JOB, and that they deal with patients with social anxiety EVERY SINGLE DAY. These are things you can do, that WILL make an improvement to your social anxiety. It will make your quality of life better, and it is absolutely worth doing. You only get one life on this earth, don’t live yours in the shackles of social anxiety because you deserve better.

Hi, I’m 13 male and i like to play street basketball with friends, play soccer and play basketball on my school team. So anyways i have something that is still really bothering me that happened 2 days ago. I was hanging out with my friend after school and his name is Dylan. We were wanting to get a street basketball game going so we called a bunch of guys and planned on playing in a hour. We had 8 guys interested. My brother was also interested and wanted to play so we said he could play. Then my mom said little later. I have a doctor appointment booked for you in 30 minutes and you have to go before you can play with your friends. She suggested all 4 of us (me, my bro, dylan) drive together to my doctor appointment and then she would drive us to the game. I said ok and quickly ran upstairs to my bedroom and put on my basketball jersey with shorts on. Then i said i’m ready to go. So we all drove to the doctors. Once we were there we didn’t have to wait long because it was booked already and the nurse comes to the waiting room and calls my name. I get up and saw my bro and dylan still sitting. I told them they could come too if they want. My mom then said are you sure because your your going to get a physical exam done. I didn’t know what that was and thought it meant was going to be showing how physical fast and strong i am. So they know im not weak for my age. So i told them yeah i don’t mind them coming in. So we got in the doctors room and we are waiting for 5 minutes and the doctor walks in. He says hi to me and my mom and then notices my friend and brother sitting in the room too. He then said are you sure you want your brother or friend in here when we do your physical exam? I said i don’t mind. Still not know what that really means. The doctor then said ok can you sit on the bed and take off your jersey? so checked my heartbeat and measured my waist. Then said ok can you remove your shorts. I was wondering why he was telling me to do this and was little embarrassed taking my shorts off in front of my brother and friend because both of them have never saw my in my underwear before or naked. Besides when i was 5 years old having a bath with my brother was the last time. So i take off my shorts and he told me to lay on the bed. So i did and pushing my tummy and using this triangle thing on my knee that makes my knee jump. He then told me he needs to check my bowels so told me to lay on my side facing away from everyone. He then lowers my underwear and my butt is now showing to everyone and i was so embarrassed! i could hear my bro and dylan giggling a bit. So then the doctor uncomfortably puts his finger in me and kinda hurt and then it was done and got me to stand up. I felt really embarrassed already and noticed my friend holding his phone and smiling. He had his phone down so i don’t know if he took a video or picture of me. Then the doctor said Can you please remove your underwear?! I was so nervous and felt anxiety coming in and looked at my bro and dylan who looked really excited. So i took off my underwear and covered myself and the doctor said put your hands on your sides. I could hear my bro and friend giggling but didn’t want to look at them. The doctor then checked everything including my frontal area for 5 minutes and also told me to turn around. Once everything was done and we left the doctors i felt so embarrassed! I didn’t want to talk to anyone. It was nobody’s fault but mine because my mom and the doctor both warned me and i didn’t know what a physical exam is. I can’t blame them. So my mom dropped us off at the basketball game but i really didn’t want to play cause i was having social anxiety and i sat off to the side. My bro and friend i noticed were talking to some guys and looked at me. I don’t know if they took a picture of me or video something but i felt embarrassed.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'I\\'m near your age and have had two jobs thus far. My social anxiety is very crippling, but I realize I need money to make my life better in the long run (i.e college funds, rent, etc). So here are some personal tips: nn1. Volunteer. Local pet shelters are great for this as they accept everyone who is willing and not a crazy psycho trying to skin cats. This will introduce you to the social environment of work, and if you volunteer at a pet shelter you will have animals to calm you during the stressful moments. Plus you can literally decide to go whenever you want. For me I go once a week for an hour or two and I even lead shifts now. It helps.nn2. Apply for quiet places. Like a fabrics store or garden center. Something very mello will help your anxiety. My first job was at Walmart in the produce section. The worst you\\'ll have to deal with is someone asking you where the oranges are while standing in front of them. You don\\'t have to work at McDonald\\'s boo, you can be a recluse and water plants for 6 hours a day.nn3. You have phone anxiety like me, so don\\'t pick up! Let them leave a voicemail. I got so many calls when applying for my first jobs and never once answered the first time. They would leave a voicemail and I would promptly call back within 2 hours to a day and give some believable excuse as to why I couldn\\'t answer such as I was in school, on the road, personal issue, bad cell service, etc. They\\'d always be happy to hear back and I would schedule interviews that way. Once you have an interview, save their number and wait for a call back and pick up if you can that time.nn4. Practice practice practice! Write down possible questions and answers to them. Go over them outloud. Take phone calls in a quiet or calm place. Practice common interview questions and prepare to be nervous.nn5. Set your hours low at first and work later or in the mornings. Go for about 18 to 20 a week and work from there. Do NOT, I REPEAT, DON\\'T set hours you\\'ll hate out of desperation that they will only want you if your availability is from 8am to 10pm Monday to Sunday. Also, pick late or early shifts. I.e pick shifts after people go to work for the day to before they get off (9am to 3pm) or after they are usually at home or asleep (9pm to early am for me personally). This is a great time to work at a store like Walmart, Target, etc. The most customers you\\'ll face are nurses or old women who are looking for plants in the meat asile. Get to know your city\\'s schedule and schedule yourself for times when the mass of people are typically busy or elsewhere. 24 hour stores are usually in need of people for these shifts.nn6. Finally, tell them you have anxiety. I have had two jobs, but have been offered over five and have applied to about 15 places. All of which, if I was interviewed, I explained my social anxiety. Employers nowadays are a bit more sensitive to this. You can say \"I have very bad social anxiety, and would prefer doing things mostly in the back or away from people until I am used to the work environment to prevent any problems from arising.\" They\\'ll usually say \"well we will train you to do x thing, but if it takes some time we\\'ll work with you.\" That\\'s when you know they\\'re interested. Don\\'t hide your anxiety to someone who can affect your future employability. My current boss and assistant manager both know how bad I suffer and often coddle me when they see it affecting my work performance. My fellow employees, though I am not friends with them, also understand this and will help me. I work in a pizza place and I take orders on register, give out food, and answer phones. When I need to step away I ask someone to take over and they will. Getting overwhelmed isn\\'t bad, just take a second to step back.nnSome other general tips to remember: Always apply for jobs you\\'ll like FIRST, wait a few days, and then apply for jobs you can deal with theoretically. Try to really go for jobs that match your interests as it\\'ll be easier to adjust to.nnIf you get denied, don\\'t freak. I did this before and it does nothing but take away all your hard work. An interview will happen again.nnI hope I helped.\\')', 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with positive effect', 'outdoor activity or space with negative effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect'], 'scores': [0.3448463976383209, 0.33540621399879456, 0.3197473883628845]}\n",

Ask yourself what your dream job would be. Then do research about what you should be doing to to get closer to having that job. If having a university education improves your chances of fulfilling your dreams, then go for university. Once you have figured whether you want to study or immediately start working, it's time to take the necessary steps to achieve your goal. Research universities you want to apply for, research employers you want to work for. Then rank them according to how attractive they seem, this will significantly reduce anxiety, as even if you don't get your first option you will likely have dozens of good alternatives on your list. You said your grades were good, so someone is very likely to accept you. nnThen try to figure out what each institution/workplace requires from you. Start writing your CV, your letter of motivation or whatever else they might need. You still have until summer before you graduate, and if you spend half an hour per day on these things the time will add up.nnRegarding your social anxiety there are many techniques you can use to reduce or remove it completely, but it does require some work. A good first step is always to ask yourself what gives you the most anxiety. Is it public speaking? Is it conversations? Based on your story it sounds like you have anxiety about meeting new people (a fear I know all too well). The best solution to this is, of course, to keep meeting new people. Find out about social activities you can do in your town or neighbourhood is there a sports-club, movie-club, hiking group, debating society? Another advice is to build a social anxiety ladder, where you will rank your anxieties from least to most anxiety provoking. Then work yourself up this list. Start by exposing yourself to situation that only makes your slightly anxious, once you feel that you can handle these more easily, start on the next item on the list.nnAlso, I need to add that just because you feel anxious around the people in your class doesn't mean that you will feel anxious around other people in the future.

            "{'sequence': \"('My old friends planned a trip and didnt invite me on the same weekend as my birthday. I (23 years old) have some old college friends I still see about every week. For various reasons, a few of those friends, have grown closer to each other, and they are closer to each other than they are to me, although we still go out for drinks, bbq, have movie nights, and have fun every week, or every other week. Their social networks are also much broader than mine, because their careers all require extensive networking. I have also made different groups of friends since college, but not to the same degree as them. I know I feature less prominently in their lives than they do in mine at this point, and it’s not personal. We still have a good time, and just because things change doesn’t invalidate the friendship we do still enjoy. And when it comes to planning any kind of party, they are definitely my favorite friends to go out for a crazy night or a drink with. All of this is fine, until it comes to my birthday. My birthday falls on Labor Day weekend. Last year most of my college friends took advantage of Labor Day weekend to go on a trip to a cabin and have fun together. The person coordinating the event (whose parents own the cabin) obviously chose who would go (only a limited number of people were allowed to come with his parents’ permission). While this same person is a friend of mine, I was not a close enough friend to make the cut to be invited on the trip. Those invited on the trip, however, included most of my friends from college. This forced me to push my birthday party to a different weekend, as I still wanted my old college friends at my birthday party (I didn’t have as many other friends yet that year). But it really made me feel pathetic to plan my birthday around people who had decided I was not important enough to include on a trip the same weekend as my birthday. From what I understand, this same group is going on a trip this Labor Day weekend—once again on my birthday. Obviously a lot of people travel on the 3 day weekend, and I’m not a narcissist who expects no one to travel just cause it’s my birthday. I am also mature enough to not be overly offended if some of my friends plan trips without including me sometimes. But it really hurts me that my college friends all have a yearly tradition to go on a trip I’m not invited on every year the same weekend as my birthday. I know we all are going our separate ways, and I know I am making too much of a deal of my birthday, but birthdays are miserable reminders of life passing by for most people after a certain age, so I feel extra vulnerable around mine, and this is a bit of a punch to the gut for the past 2 years. I don’t want to be childish and tell them not to use the 3 day weekend (that would be dumb and selfish), I don’t want to force myself onto the trip (also dumb and childish), and I don’t want to cut out friendships over something that I don’t think is meant to be personal, when these friendships are mostly rewarding throughout the rest of the year. If someone could gently help me put this into perspective, or how to make me feel less in pain about this. However I celebrate on my birthday, I know I would feel the absence of those friends, and I don’t want to plan some elaborate trip in response—that’s just petty and wouldn’t actually help me stop being petty and hurt over this. I was also thinking about going on a backpacking trip alone so I can get some time to myself, because I don’t like how my relationships with other people are affecting my sense of self worth. That’s not how I want to live my life, and maybe I need to become more independent, and I am tired of having all this stress and pageantry around my birthday. I just know that I will likely be feeling bad because of this on my birthday (I know this is immature, and I need to work past this), and I’m afraid this will be in my thoughts no matter what I do.

            "{'sequence': \"('How I overcame Social Anxiety Disorder. This is my life story focused on how I struggled with SAD and what I did to overcome and cope with this horrible disorder. I hope that others that are suffering with Social Anxiety can not only relate, but can also see a path to success. It started in 4th or 5th grade or so and continued to get at its worst in 6th grade. In 6th grade, I would avoid social situations, I wouldn’t talk to most people around me and I was always known as the “quite kid”. I wouldn’t even talk to my own family.. I completely isolated myself from everyone except a couple of friends that I made in the previous years. But sometimes, I would isolate myself from them as well. I felt different, like everyone else was normal and I wasn’t. I did not understand how to talk to people, how to laugh, how to be around others without being judged. This was an all time low for me. So how did I go from an all time low in 6th grade to overcoming SAD? Well obviously this didn’t happen over night. Lets fast forward to freshman year in high school. At this point, I am not as bad as I was in 6th grade. I was able to make a few friends in middle school around 8th grade, but most of them did not go to my high school, only two of them. But despite having friends, I was still very quite. I kept to myself, constantly just on my phone. At lunch, I really didn’t have anybody to talk to most of the time. And every time somebody tried to talk to me, I just did not know how to communicate with them, I completely shutdown and I was just basically screaming in my head please just go away! So did I ever make any new friends? Not really. I avoided social situations, I kept to myself. Another reason why I did this, is because every time I got nervous taking to someone, my face would get really hot and I turn red very fast, this led me to avoid every single social interaction that I possibly could avoid because of the fear of blushing from how nervous I got. So that’s most of my struggles with this, I need to speed things up because this is turning into a book.. I got a job as a snowboard instructor (still freshman year in high school) and I had to teach groups of kids and sometimes adults how to snowboard. As someone who was very antisocial and a clear case of SAD, this was not easy. But while it was difficult at first, it actually wasn’t that hard. I didn’t need to make small talk with the kids, all I needed to do was to talk about snowboarding and show them how to do it. I had a step by step plan and I knew exactly what I was going to say. This was the first step for me to learn how to communicate with people like a normal human being. I did this for 4 years all through high school. This job helped significantly to force me to stop avoiding situations and to face my fear of social interactions and judgment The next step was college. The first class I took was a communications class, this forced me to speak in front of people every week. This class was proof that even though my speeches sucked, I could stand in front of people and not panic. I proved to my self that despite my SAD, I can do this. This class was truly the pinnacle of overcoming SAD. This class (Mindful Communication) tested how far I have come. I went from complete isolation from people and complete avoidance of all social situations, to standing in front of a college class of 25 people, which were all judging every word I said. I don’t think it’s this class that is what helped me so much.. but it was just the test to show that I can do this. What helped me so much was a combination of things. But I think the biggest help my was my experience as a snowboard instructor. It forced me to communicate with parents, kids, and other snowboard instructors. Putting yourself in the situation that you don’t want to be in is the best way to learn to cope with social anxiety. This is what worked for me, I’m not saying you all need to become snowboard instructors, but find something that will force you to communicate with people that you also enjoy doing. It’s not easy, but this is what it takes. So am I cured? No not completely. But I do not let social Anxiety run my life like it use to. I control my anxiety and I learned to cope with it. I do not avoid social situations like I use to, and I no not get super nervous when talking to people. I have a much better relationship with my family, and I now work as a software developer. I am 23 years old, and I have overcome SAD. I still have some social Anxiety, but it is not a disorder and it’s significantly improved. I hope my story is able to help somebody out there.

            "{'sequence': '(\\' Social Anxiety: The Essentials. After looking around, I felt that sharing my story may help others. And in some way make all the pointless suffering mean something if it helps or resonates with one person. Preface: I am a 24-year-old college grad whos spent countless years languishing in deep thought/fear/pain about their own behaviors and emotions. Probably have had more internal conversations than external ones. Crushed at times under the carousel of depression/self-loathing. Other times crippled so badly by fears of judgments that basic human tasks become sources of complete life-threatening terror. This becomes further compounded when those \"loved ones\" around you gladly and publicly point out your fears as if exposing you will somehow make you stronger. All of this and more! As I share my failures, my victories, and continuous battle with social anxiety. &amp;#x200B; The best way to tell this story is perhaps through pain points of the past, present,(and even future). So I will just dive in no particular order. &amp;#x200B; The Phone Who knew a modern wonder of tech that is supposed to connect us could also be the source of such bone-numbing fear. I think it all started back in 1st grade. A girl gave me her phone number (remember I am like 7). After school I called, and we engaged in the most 7-year-old conversation ever. So basically a conversation about nothing. Afterward, I found out that my Mom and Brother had picked up the downstairs phone and listened to the whole thing. They then for weeks afterward mocked me and repeated what I said on the phone. Talk about traumas to an undefined child. It\\'s events such as those that drive you to form opinions about yourself and make an early association with fear and speaking on the phone. Fast forward and think of all the times (starting from age 7) you have had to speak on the phone. Now imagine each time the thought of using a phone is so horrible it turns your stomach over. Social anxiety in a nutshell. I\\'ve found that with time receiving a phone call was the easier evil. Somehow it being unexpected and someone else initiating the conversation took the edge off it. Having lived into adulthood, phone calls are inevitable so you eventually (through exposure) adapt and develop a tolerance for them. Yet even so to this day placing a phone call to someone is still sometimes a shaky voice and sweaty palm event, particularly when its phone interview. I have one coming up in a few days and dread the idea of literally taking a phone call to be judged by someone. And don\\'t even get me started on making or taking a call in a quiet office space. Advice: Slowly Expose yourself (naturally through time or forcibly by need) to phone interactions. Next time you order food try calling instead of making your mom do it/using an app. Make a doctor\\'s appointment. Usually calling places that handle constant phone calls ( docs/food/customer service) are the easiest to make because you know what you need to say and the person usually is going off a script. It\\'s scary (trust me), but you can work up to it. I avoided using the phone until it became ridiculous for my age and just faced it through trial and error. &amp;#x200B; The Checkout Experience For the LONGEST time growing up this was another point of contact for me and my social anxiety. Having to go alone to a counter and ask/buy something. I really honed my avoidance maneuvers. Giving money to friends to buy my ticket. Walking together up to the counter with someone and throwing my order on theirs so at least I wasn\\'t alone doing it. Or just flat out avoided buying things or asking for help. It\\'s so ingrained in me that I walk into places today and am still so determined to figure out things for myself and not ask employees/help desks for information. Just the thought of having to do it/entering a situation where you know its coming would fill me with red hot anxiety. Like I could run away on the spot. This one really holds you back in life. Today I am more accustomed to it. I worked in retail behind the counter for 4-5 years through college. (that was it\\'s own personal hell). But I kinda reduced the fear a lot over time. I went to go buy a cable recently from an electronic store. I couldn\\'t find it anywhere. Eventually, I approached a worker and said \"Where are the ethernet cables\". He looked so confused and said \"WHAT?\". The worst thing to hear with as someone with anxiety. In a split second you feel nervous, ask yourself \"What did I say wrong? Is this guy going to yell at me?\" Turning inwards and feeling all insecurities explode out into your focus. I said again more loudly \"ETHERNET cables\", and he turned and showed me where they where. Little moments like this, I imagine other people don\\'t remember or acknowledge the way I do. The fact that something so small and unimportant stuck with me for me to be able to write about shows how impactful anxiety is on you. The fixation on past \"failures\" or \"awkward moments\". Yet logic tells me that It\\'s unlikely the worker in that story noticed or cared about my behavior and certainly did not judge me at that moment. If he did, why does it matter so much? These are the sometimes underlying thoughts one must grapple with. The emotions V.S rational thoughts. You feel things that are unpleasant caused by common situations and don\\'t understand/get angry with yourself over those feelings. Then you tell yourself what other people think doesn\\'t matter, then go back to feeling those emotions again. My advice: This one is more tricky because as long as your polite and to the point you can minimize how much you actually have to speak to someone behind the counter. And often if you come into a place prepared you don\\'t have to interact at all (Digital tickets/know where you\\'re going). If this is something you want to overcome, try ordering food in person at McDonald\\'s. (Probably where I first started practicing unknowingly). It\\'s simpler because your just reading from the menu and someone can stand near you if you need it. If you\\'re like me choose one that\\'s not so busy, sometimes the energy of a big crowd can overwhelm your senses. I think remembering the person your speaking to is usually trying to do their job or just answer your question or help you can ease the nerves. &amp;#x200B; The kids \"going through changes\" Not here to repeat any cliches about puberty. Just to note how much more difficult it is to adapt to changes when you\\'re socially anxious. My mom would always say \"you\\'re going through the CHANGE\". I grew leg hair early and it was a lot. It was something my mom especially would comment on. She/ other family would ALWAYS highlight imperfections or changes they noticed on my body. Leg hair, arm hair, acne, height, weight, posture. It\\'s hard enough braving middle school with asshole peers but your own fam making you feel inadequate through teasing is hard. I started just covering everything. Wore long pants all summer, stated avoiding the pool, or exposing too much. Essentially lived like a victorian woman in 1890\\'s. I was so uncomfortable with showing my legs or anything I felt was \"not normal\" I would rather sweat and boil in summer heat then show off my body. This lasted through to high school. Eventually with time It stopped being such a big deal to me. I can only describe it as one day, you wake up, and feel no emotions(or fewer emotions) triggered at the thought of doing the act. So then you just wear shorts. Or show off your body more. Today I am mainly uncomfortable about my weight. I still feel embarrassed about taking my shirt off. I rationally acknowledge that I don\\'t think I\\'m actually as overweight as I think I am and people probably don\\'t see me as fat as I see me. I CAN take my shirt off, but I avoid going to the beach or pools because I compare myself to other more fit people, and feel so unhappy with how I look. This may sound all cliche, but anxiety really takes these things and cranks the dial up to 11. It really impacts your ability to function and changes so much about how you act/what you do/where you go. Advice: This one I\\'m still working on. I think it\\'s an uphill battle (than can be won) if you change how you think. Maturity helps a lot. Getting older and leaving behind all those teenage ideals about judgments. And judging yourself less harshly. I think that\\'s a key to a lot of this. Remember that nobody externally can COME CLOSE to judging as nastily and self-degradingly as yourself. Other people don\\'t experience your day from begging to end. Only you live with all of your memories, behavior, experiences. And therefore the only thing in your control is to slowly change how you react and feel about them. I often say to myself \"be kind to yourself\". It sounds like something you see on a motivational poster in an elementary school hallway. But it\\'s truly worth working on. I think if you stop judging yourself and holding yourself to unrealistic standards of \"perfection\", you can start working on overcoming challenges and having small victories. I saw the path to overcoming anxiety as a straight line with total victory as the goal. But this is not a pass/fail experience! Every phone call, every conversation, I got a little better. You just gotta keep focusing on the victories. (This one sounded preachy but it\\'s my truth.) One thing I heard was this: Imagine your traveling along the same road each day. The road is full of potholes. You keep walking along and without fail always fall into the potholes. For years you keep traveling the same road and keep falling in the potholes. Eventually, your become a little more alert and move out of the way of one pothole. You avoided it. The next day you fall back into the same pothole. This cycle repeats. Yet over time there are changes. Sometimes you avoid potholes. The time it takes for you to pull yourself out of the potholes is shortened. (not doing the analogy justice but you get the point) I felt like this resonated with my life a little. It taught me that overcoming social anxiety is about the progress you make each day and not about achieving some goal of perfection or \"being more normal\". Take a moment and consider how different you are from 1 year ago, and then 5 years ago? I used to be so crippled by anxiety I basically couldn\\'t do anything. Yet somehow I graduated college, survived solo presentation and group projects, worked a retail job, then worked in an office. So if you really want to change, start small and don\\'t give up. The past few days I\\'ve been really anxious and depressed on and off. So it\\'s still something I carry with me. But I\\'m still here pushing and fighting.

            "{'sequence': \"(' I feel like my SA is ruining my life. Hi, I hope this is okay to post. I'm 17F, and I struggle majorly with Social Anxiety along with a mix of Aspergers, depression and extreme highs and lows. I am in desperate need of some advice from someone who doesn't know me. I was intending on posting this in the discord server I made and own for people struggling with mental health but ironically I couldn't get over the fear of people judging me for ranting in my own server (laughing in pain), so here I am. My current situation is that I am a year and two months into an art college course. I have eight months to go to get my diploma. Easy right? I've come this far, I can do the rest. Except, I can't. Every day that I'm there, I sit alone, trying to get my work done but for some reason I feel like absolute shit every second of every day spent there. I can't nearly begin to explain how it feels, the best I can describe it is as a physical heaviness on my chest, different from my normal anxiety. Even just thinking back to the feelings is enough to send me into panic. I mentioned at the beginning of this post that I deal with extreme highs and lows, and what I mean by this is that I have two bigger moods in my daily life, (high and low) and then I have normal mood me which for a while I didn't think existed but following therapy I have discovered that that middle mood is there. When I'm experiencing a high, it's almost as if I switch into a completely different person, like an extrovert. I start cracking jokes in front of people, I participate in all conversations, I feel confident and on top of the world, I feel restless and hyperactive. Having a high is completely random, there's no triggers that I've noticed. I also haven't noticed any triggers for my lows. When I'm low, I feel worthless; sad; emotional; silent; slow; unproductive and I get urges to either SH or kill myself. When I'm out of a low, it's hard to look back and remember in detail what happened, as if it's misted up in my brain like an old memory. When I was younger I was extremely depressed, and I SH and attempted suicide many times, so maybe this is a factor in the sudden urge to harm myself when I'm low as a reaction to negativity? I'm not sure. My 'normal mood' is me feeling calm with not much anxiety and no negative thinking, which to me feels like a happy mood compared to what I experience during a low. Back to my situation - when I'm at college and I experience these lows, there's nothing I can do to handle it, I can't just go to bed and sleep to escape it, or wrap up in a warm blanket and avoid all social interaction. I have to sit in a studio with thirty other people, feeling like that, and often times it leads to meltdowns or panic attacks. I have tried listening to music; fiddling with fidget toys; going for a walk outside; watching netflix; talking to lecturers about it; focusing on work; taking a break from my work and doing different art; drinking water; breathing exercises; sitting in the bathrooms; texting my partner; planning shopping lists. None of these coping mechanisms work. One thing I have noticed is that I either have a low, panic attacks or I get that physical sad heaviness on my chest that feels suffocating every single day at college, which I think has created a fear around attending the course due to having no escape from these emotions and feelings. I've only had a high at college about four or five times. I do remember a time at the beginning of the course where I didn't feel the suffocating heaviness, just the casual anxiety around people. I used to have friends on this course, we were a group of five but this year they've expanded the friendship group, which is all the people on the course. Socialising with four other people was enough for me to come home exhausted and needing to recharge, but I can't handle socialising with a group of 30 odd people. Since then, I've isolated myself from the group - not that the original group have really tried to involve me in the new group. Another thing to add is that I've never been able to maintain a friendship for longer than a year, my boyfriend of almost two years is the longest relationship of any sort I've had. Is this just me, or does anyone else have the same issue? I went on holiday with my boyfriend and parents for three days last week and my god, I felt free. I did feel anxiety and some strong emotions but they felt reasonable because I was in busy environments like a swimming pool or a restaurant. This was great news to me because I thought, hey, this is what life can be like. Then I came home. Hell broke loose within me. I couldn't get myself out of bed to go to college, I haven't been there in almost a week and my attendance is poor enough as it is. I can't work up the energy to shower. I don't feel hungry. I can't even get up to brush my teeth. I don't even want to do art, I've tried, it gives me too much time to think. I've tried sleeping it off, but then the next day comes too quickly and I have to rinse repeat. I'm having about four or five panic attacks a day and a night. I'm keeping my boyfriend awake because we're both scared that I will end up in a mindset where I can't take it anymore and I give up. I can't think about the future without melting down. It's mental and physical hell. I thought it was because of college that I feel this way, that I've had a taste of freedom and I've realised that college isn't it for me. But I'm not sure that's it. I was going to drop out, frustrated and disappointed in myself that I can't make it another eight months to get my art diploma but was confident that I'd be taking a step towards healing my mental health. Then came the bad news, my mum told me that if I drop out then I need to get a job to pay rent because she can't afford to keep me here if she doesn't get government benefits for me. My boyfriend (19M and a full time worker) lives with us, and we're currently sleeping in my parents front room in the side of the house. We've already been told that if we don't move out soon they'll kick us out. We've been looking for places to rent but nobody considers us because we're so young. This has only worsened my anxiety, and I know that I probably seem quite pathetic because I'm scared of working but it isn't just that, I've worked before and I got fired for having panic attacks. It isn't just an unreasonable fear anymore, it's my worst fear at a job come true. So, my choices are: 1. Drop out of college to save my mental health but be forced to find a job and pay rent which will only worsen my mental health anyway, leading me down a path of feeling suicidal for a period of time and then attempting suicide. I've been down that mental path before too many times and I don't want to die so this choice doesn't seem like a good one for me. 2. Continue college for the last eight months, continue feeling this mental hell that I so badly wanted to escape. Get my diploma, be forced to get a job when the course ends anyway. Go back down on the same path of mental health and feeling suicidal. Again, I don't want to die. This is where I'm stuck. Both paths worsen my mental health which I don't want. And I appreciate that not many people enjoy school or working, but to me this isn't just about lack of enjoyment, it's as if there is something in my body that physically stops me from doing it. You know when you have two magnets that are facing the wrong way so you physically cannot connect the two? There's always that distance as you try your best to grip them in your hands and force them together. That's what I experience in my chest, and it's not just an emotion, it's as if there is actually a magnet in my chest. Like, no matter how hard I try to just push through and do these things like jobs or courses, there's a force that won't let me. Believe me, I'm frustrated at myself too for being such a failure. And to address the paths of feeling suicidal, I'm not talking about it like that to be dramatic, I mean it in a way that it's my life pattern and I can't fix it, no matter what I try. My mental health deteriorates, I keep going through it and try my best to get through to the light at the end of the tunnel, but it gets too much, too many lows, too many bad thoughts, too much for me to take. I either take myself to hospital, or I attempt suicide. And it's easy to just say well why don't you push harder, try for longer. I've tried, either way I end up in the hospital waiting room. I've attempted three times this year, the last was this Summer, where I was in the waiting room with my boyfriend from 9:45pm until 11am the next day after being promised a bed on a ward. I was discharged within an hour of being seen. Having been so many times with no help or answers as to why I'm like this, going to hospital isn't an option anymore because obviously there's nothing they can do for me. It hurts so bad that there's nothing I can do to make this better or to make this go away, I don't want to die and leave all my pain to my boyfriend, but I want to not exist anymore, it seems like the only option I have that isn't months and months of torture followed by attempting suicide as a result of it all anyway. My boyfriend is an angel, he didn't sign up for this when he met me and I feel like such a burden on him, but he insists that he'll always be there for me and he compares it to when I was his rock when he was depressed and anxious but he was strong enough to not give up, unlike me. Is this just bad social anxiety? Or is there something wrong with me? Does anyone else feel like this? I hope this made some sort of sense to somebody out there. TLDR; I have two options of continuing college or getting a job, but both feel physically impossible due to anxiety and bad mental health. I fear both paths will lead to me killing myself.

I think that would be a good way to gauge whether or not he has similar feelings towards you. In terms of talking to him in person, you don't necessarily have to give off the perfect impression every time you are with him. If he is a genuine guy, he won't judge you for appearing a little shy or vulnerable. But at any rate, my advice to you is to do whatever it is that calms you down (listen to music, take a short walk, etc.) and just go for it. Whether he responds positively to you or not, you will never know unless you try. Also, don't try and force yourself to act any differently and be true to yourself. This is all pretty cliche, but it really is the truth haha, and the older I get, the more I realize it.

Taking a walk is a great way, you can start in a residential place with less people and then move on to place with more and more. Going to movie theaters, fast-food, restaurants, conventions, also helped me. All situations where I had just a little anxiety but that let me see how people acts and let me understands them a little better. Another thing that you need to do, is stopping to be negative about yourself. You don\\'t seems to be that negative, though you do say \"anyone who bothers to read this\" which seems like it\\'s negative reading your thread (it doesn\\'t bother us, we are there to read theses threads, like any other one), but it\\'s important that you are aware that you should avoid negative though. Often we justify being negative by saying that this way you are aware of your flaw, which is better than not. Sadly often we are wrong, theses negatives though aren\\'t that important and they are amazing to lose any motivation to improve. Instead, you need to find the positive in the situation and if really there\\'s something negative important, don\\'t see it as negative but as something to improve.  at this point i have no assurances and putting my faith in a psychologist only to go thru months and years of no improvement would probably destroy me.

I can say it is not as severe as having to drop out of school but it was pretty close to it. A few things I can tell you: 1) Mindfulness. Something I SHOULD practice more of.. but mindfulness is a form of meditation to help bring your mind out of the constant state of thinking (i.e. about if others are judging me) and brings you to a complete focused state. Look up mindfulness audio sessions or something like that on google, there is plenty of tutorials and things to help. 2) \"Don\\'t break the chain\" ..its something the famous comedian Jerry Sienfeld talked about. This is a comedian who has done so many stand up routines that it seemed so unlikely he was able to write that many jokes! How does he do so many one hour specials?! He mentioned it was something he calls \"dont break the chain,\" or in other words he would write a joke every single day, good or not, but do so EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. The reason I say this is because you should find something to work on every single day, no matter what! I myself joined a gym about a year and a half ago.. it was not because I wanted to lose weight (though that was on my mind as well) but because I needed some constant factor in my life that I would put forth effort each day to complete, something I HAD to do, to keep my mind on it.. You should find something to do, even if it\\'s just drawing a small picture or running a mile.. do it EVERY DAY! And if for whatever reason you can\\'t.. just do it the next day! In all of my years in dealing with social anxiety (and a negative family putting me down) I realize that the anxiety stems mostly from overthinking. Is that person looking at me from their car as I walk down the street? Am I worthless because I don\\'t have a job? Is what I\\'m wearing okay? etc. the list is endless. For me, social anxiety has stopped me from my potential being fully realized. It has stopped me from having a healthy relationship with pretty much any woman. It has stopped me from going out on the few beautiful days I see here.. I still have it, but not as bad. I practice a few things every day and you eventually reach a point of self confidence.

When I turned 9, I started covering my face with my hair because I felt better if I wasn’t exposing too much of my face When I was 10, I started developing social anxiety and started wearing baggier clothing, I also started looking in the mirror for hours a day. When I turned 11, I started covering my face more than ever before, I’d only wear certain types of clothing that I thought were “less revealing,” my anxiety started to become worse than it’d ever been before and got pulled out of school for it. When I was 12, I started noticing changes in my appearance from hour to hour, or day to day, these changes were usually in my face. Everyday, I’d wake up and think to myself, “okay, am I gonna be pretty or ugly today?” I don’t really know what the real me looks like anymore, sometimes I barley recognize my own reflection. Sometimes I stare in the mirror for hours a day, just pointing out flaws or changes. Sometimes I avoid looking in the mirror all together. Most of the time I don’t even see myself as a human, or too ugly to even be a human. I’ve had thoughts of performing surgery on myself and imagining how perfect I’d be if I done it, but I try not to think about it. Everyday, I watch videos about plastic surgery. Somehow, I feel like all of my problems would be gone if I just changed some of my facial features, like I’d be able to live an actual life. I’d pay any price for it, I don’t care if it could kill me, I’d do it. When I used to go to school, I’d carry out certain ways of getting ready. I’d mainly go to school on days where I felt like I looked like an actual human, most of the times I’d just cry in front of a mirror saying to myself “you’re disgusting.” It’s gotten easier since I’ve stopped going to school, but it still bothers me a lot. Minor inconveniences like catching a person staring at me, or wind blowing in my face and blowing my hair away from it would ruin my day.

I’m excited to talk to my doctor about this, because I feel like it might be the start of me actually beginning to feel happier again.

That's kind of the nature of my volunteer work, but you could volunteer with a food bank or boys  and girls club, which would involve more social interaction. You're getting out there AND making a difference! Generally I think getting out of the house and doing anything is progress, whether you're interacting with other people or not. Because I'm not sure about you or anyone else, but when my social anxiety is bad, I retreat into myself and stay home where I'm comfortable. Just breaking that cycle by going for a short walk around the neighbourhood is a good idea. You could smile and say hello to people as you walk by, which may or may not be difficult for you or practice mindfulness.

Don't give up if the first place you call can't see you. Keep trying. Then you keep seeing them. Do your best to be as open and honest as possible and actually try the things they suggest you do no matter how stupid or or useless they seem. These are trained professionals, not someone looking to make you into a fool. With some time you will start feeling more stable. Not better, but stable. Then you start trying to work on finding something you enjoy. Games, movies, music, dogs, reading, helping old ladies cross the street. It really doesnt matter what it is. Just find something that sucks less than the other things and keep doing it. Try and see if there is a way to help the social anxiety while doing that. If you like dogs, go to a dog park or a regular park and ask to pet someones dog. If its movies maybe try to go to a movie store or something and buy/rent/look at a movie. If its music go to a record store and look at what they have. Just something you can do that adds a social element to whatever it is you find you like. And keep pushing that boundary. Hows your hygiene? If you arent showering at least every other day. Start. There is literally not a single excuse for not doing it.

Try and find something that is more enjoyable than other things. Something to look forward to doing and just enjoy it and once you are into it more, try and incorporate social aspects into it. 3.

They would always feel guilty about not realising and taking action and might blame themselves entirely. Please don't do this to them, you at least owe it to them to get help.

But i\\'ve been typing this for too long to delete it all so sorry I\\'m not meaning to rub it in anyones face, I\\'m just sharing my experience  and#x200B; I\\'m 17 and have had 3 girlfriends technically but only really count one. In middle school was my first relationship with this girl named C. It started when I asked her to a dance (which was extremely nerve racking), and that was before my SA got too bad. It was a pretty standard relationship. We held hands and hung out. Then we broke up like 2 weeks later. Then at the end of 9th grade I started dating a girl named M. We kinda dropped hints that we liked each other but never did anything about it. A few weeks into summer I mustered up the courage and sent her a long heartfelt text about how I really liked her and whatnot. I wasn\\'t really asking her out, but just making my feelings clear. Then like a week later she asked me out and I said yes. I think we hung out once during our relationship then she dumped me about 2 weeks in with the classic \"It\\'s not you, it\\'s me\" excuse. Fast forward 3 years to the end of summer before 12th grade starts. This girl named D that I kinda knew from school replies to a photo of my dog on IG and we start talking. I really like skateboarding and post a lot of videos of me skating and she complemented me on those. I told her that I could teach her if she wanted and after a little convincing we decided to meet. Initially I was REALLY nervous about meeting her. When I offered to teach her how to skate, I was just being friendly in hopes I might make a new friend to skate with. However she dropped some hints that she liked me which instantly made me 100x more nervous to meet her. I made one of my friends come along because I know he\\'s goofy and would take attention off me if I needed. Anyways the meeting went well and D and I continued to talk and become more friendly. After awhile we both know that we like each other and are basically bf and gf. For some reason D had this idea that someone had to explicitly ask the other person out for it to be a couple. She told me she wanted me to ask her out and I said that it\\'s silly to ask someone to ask you out. If you both want to date each other and both know that you want to date each other, then you\\'re basically bf and gf, no need for someone to ask the other out. Anyways she then asks me out a few weeks later and so I guess that\\'s technically the started of our relationship, but it\\'s whatever. I think we dated for around 5 months. D was the first girl that I ever truly felt like I loved. I genuinely felt like I would do anything for her and that I wanted to be with her forever. Then what felt like out of nowhere, she tells me she\\'s not happy and wants me to do more for her. She wants me to know what she wants without her telling me. I tell her I\\'ll try my best and we continue dating. A week later she dumps me because she just doesn\\'t like me anymore. For a few days I was extremely depressed. I sit through school feeling numb, then I\\'d come home and lie in bed watching youtube until it was time to fall asleep. I was even somewhat suicidal at some point. She also got mad at me because one of her guy friends threatened to beat the shit out of me if I talked to her and I basically called him a retarded and messed with him a little. Apparently in her mind, me messing with her friend was worse than him threatening to beat me up and so she stopped talking to me as well. At that point I wasn\\'t as depressed but I was still sad. But about a day after she stopped talking to me I suddenly realized that I didn\\'t need her. After I realized that, I instantly became happier. I stopped caring about her and started caring about myself. I started skating more often and talking to friends. It\\'s been about a month since we broke up and I\\'m feeling better than ever. Just remember anons, you dont need a girl or boy to be happy. Do things that you enjoy, find a hobby, meet new friends.

Well, I\\'m currently in my second semester of college and everything is online. I\\'m also working part-time at my third job, a walmart stocker... and well, I have been surprised that I have been able to talk to my co-workers and customers with no problems at all, really, no social anxiety. Now, it\\'s probably due to wearing a mask like when I had sunglasses on during my summer jobs.. However, I still have general anxiety about being rushed to finish things and that\\'s making me feel horrible, exhausted, and so stressed out Highschool is when it all started, my social anxiety. Before then, I always been an introvert who barely talked, shy, and had nothing really to say. When I did speak, often times I had to repeat it since no one could hear me.. I\\'m just naturally soft spoken I guess. My two older siblings have anxiety too.. (sorry about how I am texting, I\\'m tired and having trouble putting this together). Uh, highschool took a toll on me and it was draining. Symptoms that I remember: erythrophobia, serve trembling, jerking, and shaking in my neck, head, hands, shoulders, and torso, feeling like I can\\'t speak because my voice would be all shakey, sweating excessively, overthinking, tearful eyes, and fast heartbeat. All of this made me the popular loner, everyone liked me but I never talked much. I did have a few groups of friends that made life easier.. Though, I was that person who was terrified to be alone at lunch. I\\'m 6\\'2 too, and I felt like I stuck out too. Reading became my habit because it was an excuse to not having to do social activities All of this made me go to sleep wanting to, well, die. Kind of embarrassing to say this but.. I usually fantasize myself dying before going to sleep, and it helps me fall asleep. It\\'s like how I say, \"I\\'m going to quit my job\" which makes me able to get through the day. I dreaded school, just like I do with work, but for stress, and well, yeah.. I don\\'t know if I still have social anxiety? I mean, yes, I never turn my camera on in school but I have no problems at work. I don\\'t like speaking but I can speak not without a shakey voice. I gotten used to my heigh and I don\\'t shake as much as I used too.. Did I finally, after 5 years of fighting it, win? I\\'m not smart, honestly, to never seek help.. I do regard myself poorly.. I don\\'t think I\\'m intelligent.. smart enough to succeed in this world. I don\\'t like myself, how I look, the way I act, think, and how I can\\'t maintain conversations since it\\'s boring or how I don\\'t want to talk, like, at all. perhaps I\\'m in denial about being depressed.. I probably should quit my job too and Idk, try to tackle it on my own again.. However, I had the whole beginning of Covid to do so.. but I just wasted time.. I\\'m scared to seek help because it\\'s going to be embarrassing.. And really, I have memory problems and well, I feel like I\\'m going to forget what to say.

Hi, before I begin talking about my social anxiety, I would just like to say that this is not my usual account, I created this because I feel that it would hinder my ability to properly express myself if I use my personal account. Sorry if this infringes on any of the rules, I am not totally familiar with them. You can take this down if you want or let me know and I will fix/take it down for you. Im 18 years old, male and I believe that I have some form of social anxiety and I want to share how it has so far affected my life. I recently started university in the UK and I am in a flat of 13 other people. My earliest memory, and I believe one of the causes of my social anxiety was Christmas day when I was about 6 or 7. My Uncle came to our house for the first time (he lived in another country) and he brought a camcorder. He filmed us opening our presents and I was so excited I always wanted to be on camera and see myself on the TV. When I heard my voice on the TV aged 6, I wanted it turned off immediately. I try never to speak on camera even now. I have usually found it really really hard to make new friends. If I make one, I latch on to him as much as possible and usually divert any conversations to them if someone I know tries to initiate a conversation with me. Im currently at 6 weeks into university and I haven’t made any friends, which is my fault because I don’t initiate any conversations and any conversations that I do have last around 6 seconds because I don’t know what to say to people. Its usually, goes “Hi, (insert name here)” - Other person “Hi (insert name here)” – Me “How are you?” – Other person “Good, you?” – Me “Im good” – Other person “That’s good” – Me (Awkward pause and I walk off to avoid further embarrassment) I promised myself that on the first day I moved in I would introduce myself to everyone but when I walked in, they said hi and I got really hot and flustered and couldn’t. I rarely leave my room, only to go to lectures and seminars (which I worry about hours beforehand) and I often go days without eating proper food because people are currently in the kitchen. At School it was a little bit of a benefit because while people would take time in their work to talk, I would out of awkwardness, concentrate fully on my work. Now at university, they suggest that you join or form a study group with your friends, which is hard because Im on the other side of the country and I have no friends here. I am really worried how I will communicate with others when we have to start giving group presentations and working in groups. We haven’t even been assigned one yet and it already takes up hours of worry in my mind. I am worried because I want to be successful at whatever it is that I am doing but I cant properly talk to people and I know that this will be a huge hindrance. I have never approached someone of the opposite gender and talked to them, I don’t know what to say. I only have one friend who is a girl and its more a friendship of association because she is my friends girlfriends. One of the feelings that I get when I am around people is a feeling of inferiority. I am 5 foot 5, which is small for a male, and have always been the smallest in my class. I have been mistaken for up to 6 years younger than I am and I think this is one of the causes of it. I cant just talk to someone for the sake of it I have to have a reason otherwise I would be wasting their time. If someone else initiates a conversation with one of my friends or vice versa I stand there really really awkwardly. I cant wait in queues with a whole bunch of people because I feel like I am holding them up. If I am waiting to go into a lecture, I wait towards the back of the group because I don’t want to add to their displeasure of waiting. Its almost as if, subconsciously, that my presence offends people. Not that I think that I am in any way important, quite opposite, I feel like a nobody. If there was anything important that I needed to ask someone about that I didn’t know from school, I would do it on facebook, and even then it would take a few hours to come up with what I saw as the right way to frame this. Even for this post, I have to keep reminding myself that it is anonymous. My parents don’t know how seriously it affects me. They think Im shy and often when I was younger they would get cross because I wouldn’t socially interact with other people for summer camps, for example. Anyway, the purpose of this post was to share my experience with social anxiety and at least get a little bit of the pressure off my chest. Having not talked so freely in my entire life it feels that I have had a little bit of word vomit.

My 'issues' started when I was 15, as far as I know. Right before my birthday I had gone through what I would consider to be a traumatic experience. And so began the slow and dreadful downhill spiral into complete nothingness. First I was just homeschooled. Then I lost all contact with supposed friends. Then the outside world completely. At this point I was still functional enough to mow the lawn and go to basic places like doctors, dentists, grocery stores, etc. Those eventually all stopped and I isolated myself, pretty much professionally if I do say so myself. After a while of kind of enjoying being alone I started not enjoying it so much. I found myself daydreaming of having friends and those memorable moments that don't take place on your mom's couch. And after not too long of that, I started feeling like I would die without it. But I didn't know how to talk to people anymore. What to say, how to act, what to do. In just a few short years I forgot how to be a human. I still have no fucking clue of what to do in social situations. But, and now fast forward to the present. I don't like people anymore and now those 'dreams' of having friends have turned into full blown nightmares of having (keyword having) to do stuff eventually. I can't just hide from the world my entire life no matter what 'reasons' I have. It's confusing though. I never maintain the same perspective for more than a few days. Some days I wake up feeling lonely, and praying for someone to text me. Others, I wake up not even being able to stand my little siblings saying good morning to me. On top of that, there's not voices, but there's definitely two different versions of my voice in my head. I'll attempt to provide at least a decent example. Version #1, I feel like I have a 2 foot dick just blowing it in the wind as I sit comfortably in my high horse and look down on all the peasants. Version #2, I feel like I have a 2 inch soggy day old breadstick from Little Caesar's say between my legs and I'm nothing more than the scum of the earth. (The dick metaphors are the best representation of one's ego I could think of. Just go with it. Pls.) Then there's the personality aspect of it. There's day where I talk to people on Skype and I couldn't be happier. I enjoy the shit out of myself and act like an idiot just for a good laugh. Then there's days where I wish I could hit the lottery. Just to hire a group of Russian mercenaries to kill all the stupid people that annoy me. The worst part, I'm not even talking about genuinely annoying. I'm talking about my version. Example, someone asking me a question that I feel is pointless, makes my head ring, and I go back to the thought of hiring mercenaries. I can't really explain this part well, but I feel like people do shit on purpose. There's NO way the general public is so stupid, and annoying that I actually pray for mass genocide on a daily basis.

I almost fell over and at first I was so shocked that I didn\\'t say anything as they walked away (just walked, didn\\'t even try to run) and my anxiety kicked in and I thought \"just don\\'t say anything\" but then about 10 seconds pass and I decided to shout at them.

I continued walking, feeling pretty shit about myself. I sat down in my usual spot and I tried to relax but I couldn\\'t. I felt really anxious and shaky. I\\'m a pretty sensitive guy anyway, but this is something I\\'ve never experienced before and I kept playing over in my head how lame I sounded when I shouted at them and I actually felt like crying. While I was sitting under a tree, feeling terrible and trying not to cry in public I saw them come back over to me and one of them threw a rock at me. It didn\\'t hit me, but it freaked me out. Then before I could say anything, they started throwing rocks at windows, trying to break them. Seeing them again actually made me feel calm, my anxiety lifted. I was really nervous about passing them again to leave the park, but then when I saw them I realised they were just a bunch of idiot kids and I felt alright. Anyway, I called the police and they picked me up in a van and we drove around the neighbourhood trying to find them but couldn\\'t so they drove me home. I was hoping we\\'d catch them, because even though that would mean I would have had to face them again, I kind of wanted them to realise I wasn\\'t some push over who just allows kids to assault me.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'I did it! I got my hair cut!. Im going to apologize in advance and just say that I often give too many details in my stories making them very long but that\\'s just how I do it. I like to explain everything. My thought process what I was thinking and feeling.. A few days ago I realised that my hair had gotten pretty long. It had been around 3 months since my last haircut. I know it was before December 24 2015. For a few hours last night before I went to bed I was trying to look up places I could get my hair cut. The price and how long it would take to walk. Every time I\\'ve had my hair cut and the hairdresser asks how to cut it I just stutter a \"err idk just shorter. Do what you want\" and in a thread I\\'ve made before about getting my hair cut people were suggesting that I show a picture of what I want done. So I looked up pictures of myself on phone and narrowed it down to 3 pictures I believe were taken a week or two after I had my hair cut. \"This looks short enough. I\\'ll just show them this\". The whole day leading up to me entering the door to the haircutter I was thinking \"should I go. Should I just do it another day\" but each step I took (eating breakfast, getting dressed, going outside) that got me closer to the haircutter the more forced I felt to actually go through with it. I tried to think less and just do it. The place is a rather small place and you can\\'t even pay with a card, only cash (as I found out) and the guy who cut my hair didn\\'t speak the language very well. When I went in there were 2 employees and the boss. All being with a customer and cutting their hair so I sit down and wait. Usually the place is pretty full (as I said it\\'s a pretty small room) and I was worried about looking like a fool in front of other customers trying to ask if they had time for a drop-in customer. A lot of people who go there seems to be friends with the owner too or know them very well which makes it feel worse. Like if the owner is just a complete stranger to them then we have something in common. I sit there for a couple of minutes and the owner (who\\'s cutting someone\\'s hair) makes eye contact with me like he\\'s wondering what I\\'m doing. Making me feel anxious ish. A guy walks in, he clearly knows the owner, after a bit he asks how long until he\\'s free. Owner says 5m and the guy goes outside to smoke or whatever. So there I am, just sitting there awkwardly, wondering if I should be asking if they have time for a drop in or something. Or do I just wait here until one of them is done cutting and stands behind the register?? Ofc i chose to sit there like a socially awkward dude. Once the owner is done with his customer he starts to get ready to go outside for a smoke break. I didn\\'t stand up or talk to him I just sat awkwardly. I felt like I had missed an opportunity. But a minute or so after that the other guy was done cutting his customers hair too and I asked him if he has time for a drop in and he said yes. And here\\'s the best part. Remember, this is the very first time I was going to show the haircutter a picture of how I want mine cut, so I had rehearsed it a million times in my head already. Show picture, say I want something like that, sit down. I awkwardly say \"is. . I brought a picture\" I pull up my phone which has the picture already loaded. \"Something like this?\" He takes the phone and asks \"do this?\" I\\'m like ..yeah do that. Like that. A few moments of silence after I sit down, he seems hesitant to cut it like that. \"Like that or.. better\" NO YOU\\'RE DEVIATING FROM THE SCRIPT. \"Ehh heh better I guess if you can\" are the words that leave my mouth. He says \"this picture.. not very good. Not that good looking hair\" I\\'m like well shit I spent like 10 minutes anxious over which picture to use and it\\'s not a great pic I agree but it\\'s fine. It\\'s short. I just want it shorter. So I say \"heh yeah do better if you can then. If you want\". \"I can do better\" he says and starts cutting. Once he\\'s done he says something and I was like huh what did you say? I asked that maybe 2 to 3 times during that whole visit. I felt like such an incompetent ass. Oh remember how I didn\\'t know it was a cash only place? He said nope sorry can\\'t pay with card here. And I\\'m like oh god.. \"where can I find an atm..\" he says around the corner \"you know where?\" I Say no and he gestures again around the corner. So I go around the corner but see no atm I ask 2 women passing by where the nearest atm is and it\\'s a biiit further away. Around another corner. I feel like the haircutter might think I\\'m not gonna pay so I had intentionally left my jacket behind. Had to stand in line for the atm (lady took god same forever) and I was thinking about how long it was taking me to get back so I could frikken pay him. Anyway I finally had it done. Usually my dad drives me to some place and comes with me (since he has to wait for me anyway) which makes me feel like shit and like a child. I\\'m 22. It looks good now I think and I rode the high of \" I did something today \" for a few hours after that. If you actually read everything then I\\'m sorry haha. I should learn how to be more concise but I just feel like I want to convey every detail possible. As if the person listening to my story was there. That\\'s why I like pictures.

I almost never got invited to hang around outside or to birthday parties in my life, all I do is sit at home infront of my computer all day. Although, I've finally hanged outside 3 weeks ago with 2 of my new friends, started to be a bit boring to them, just like with others :(. All of my classmates don't care even slightly about me and pretend as if I don't exist at all. To be honest, my biggest dream is that I would finally wake up socially active, not anxious, many good friends to talk for a long time, hang around together, don't get ignored by about everyone. I don't know what to do about myself, I am so inconsistent in socializing and it makes me feel very bad about myself, lonely, friendless, depressed and suicidal. I tried everything, and today I didn't talk with anyone :(')\", 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with negative effect', 'outdoor activity or space with positive effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect'], 'scores': [0.5106123089790344, 0.27343636751174927, 0.2159513533115387]}\n",
            "{'sequence': '(\\'I can\\'t be alone. So here it goes.... I\\'m a 20 yo male from the US. I have been consciously struggling with social anxiety for about 3 years now. I really don\\'t know where to start because my anxiety spreads across many categories. The most prominent and most harmful,though, is my fear of rejection. I am constantly dwelling on my peers\\' apparent perception of me. After every action I make, whether it be getting out of my chair or commenting on a coworkers statement, I analyze the body/facial expression of the other parties in the room. Most of the time my interpretation is a negative one. I am a first born child and am comfort able with my alone time and quite enjoy it but my ADHD makes me outgoing and talkative (though sometimes about obscure topics). I very much enjoy the connection from carrying on a conversation with someone and knowing that they understand and empathize with you. Throughout high-school I was the class clown. I always had some snide remark to make or an opinion to give on everything. I had my small group of friends but I felt that I annoyed even them. I graduated HS and decided enough was enough. I\\'m not gonna be that obnoxious guy anymore. I got back on my medicine and went off to college. Screwed up pretty bad my first semester and got kicked out of my housing (still enrolled ). I felt horrible about it because the offense that got me kicked out was something I told my parents I stopped doing a while back when they caught me. Anyway.. At this point I had just started to make friends outside of the people I knew from my hometown and I could see things about to turn around. But when I found out that I was being kicked out of my housing and wasting my parents 8k they had already spent on the following semester housing as well as the rent for the new place I fell into a really bad depression. I lost connection with all of my friends except one( who happened to be my previous roommate and got kicked out with me). We felt each other\\'s pain and consoled one another with alcohol and Xbox one. I started drinking .. A lot. Like everyday. Ironically it didn\\'t affect my grades though because we were still in freshman level courses and Calc always came easy to me. Fast forward 1 year. Me and roommate get a new place together and are doing great(or so it seems). We move into a little college apt complex where I already knew a ton of people. That first semester was great. We got along great daily and never fought. Shit we still have never fought. We hung out with the same group of friends and I was even more popular than him! I was having a great time and really loved my roommate/best friend like a brother. Then winter break came. All was going great. Still partying in my hometown and catching up with old friends and still hanging out with the ones that came home from school with me. Blah blah blah I ran into a girl from one of my classes downtown one night and we made plans to hangout. I brought a friend she brought a friend. The friend she brought ended up being my girlfriend and first love of 2 years. And my friend and the other girl hooked up a little but that\\'s a different story.... Getting tired of typing on phone so I\\'m gonna wrap it up ... Roommate and Girl from downtown start talking. (Me and that girl always had some spark between us but never made a move on it again story for another time) girl talks shit about roommate behind his back to me (dumb) calls him gay and says she only hangs out with him for a gay cuddle buddy. I tell him he doesn\\'t believe me. Asks her she denies it. She keeps talking shit. She starts getting really controlling and making him look like her puppy following her around and conforming to her every whim. It was nauseating. At this point there was a little tension between her and I as I was obviously not gonna take her side on things because she was manipulating my best friend and I was pretty blatant about that. But I decided to take the high road and still be her friend and what not. Things started to go south. She started to act weird and say passively rude things to me when she was drunk but never out right aggressive. She started to resent my other friend (the one that hooked up with her a while back ) and would be very aggressive with him at parties. To the point of getting him kicked out of a few. I didn\\'t care, he was being an ass most of the time and deserved it. Then she started lumping me into her little outbursts. And one night she got particularly drunk and went off on him. Once he was kicked out she turned it on me. I didn\\'t even listen to it though cause she was obviously obliterated so I just walked home. Next weekend there was a birthday party down the road from me and she was going as well as all my friends so I decided to go. Stayed for an hour or so but didn\\'t know many people and was getting bored so I went to leave. Said my good byes to the people I knew there and went for the door. Saw roommate and girl sitting by the door. Said bye to roommate and went to say bye to her but she was obviously ignoring me so I patted her lightly on the head and kindly said \"bye \\'girl\\'\" and opened the door. I hear \"did he just pat me on the head?? Is he calling me a dog or something ?!?\" I try to b line out of this drunken situation before it manifests into a full on shit show. But I was too late. She runs for the door and shoves me as much as she could and yells \"GET OUT!\" ( her signature drunken outburst at the time ) I turned around and calmly said \"\\'girl\\' I didn\\'t mean to offend you, we\\'re all friends here I\\'m sorry, you\\'re just drunk\" or something along those lines. She stops her feet in place and yells for roommate at the top of her lungs. And like clock work he comes running out of no where and stands by her side. I had had enough so I just grabbed my girl by the arm and we walked home. Then things started to get weird. I talked to my roommate about it and asked him why she was mad at me. He said she wasn\\'t. Okay cool. So i tried talking to her and she ignores me. Okay so I ask him again same response. Wtf roommate bros before hoes right? Apparently he had never heard the expression. Then a day would pass when I didn\\'t see or hear from him. Which hadn\\'t happened since the day I met him. Oh well I figured I\\'d let them work it out. Then weeks passed. Then we\\'d talk about bullshit. Then more weeks. Then a month. Then the semester was over and he left without saying a word. We had already signed a lease for the next semester and he told me a week before the next semester that he had backed out last minute and was living somewhere else. Great Well he moves in with some of my so called friends and then I lost contact with most of them as they were girls friends before mine. So I was slowly phased out of the group and then was all alone. And social anxiety has just snowballed. TL;DR : best friend didn\\'t listen to bros b4 hoes and then took all my friends and left my by myself.

For a while I never understood people who posted on here and on other subs saying they have no friends but they\\'re okay with that. If they\\'re okay with it it won\\'t change! But I was wrong. 90% of people are going to think you\\'re a weirdo for not having friends, but they don\\'t know you, and they\\'re shallow. No one is going to support your loneliness so you might as well accept that sometimes shit happens in life and you end up alone for a while but that\\'s okay and natural. I think the guilt of loneliness affects your mental health before the actual loneliness does. Growing up I became more and more aware of my lack of friends. I had more friends then than I have now, but less than most people I knew. For a long time I didn\\'t see the problem. When I didn\\'t see my lack of friends as a problem, this meant that when I was having a social interaction I wasn\\'t self conscious. I didn\\'t have my mothers voice in the back of my head telling me I should have more friends. I remember in school, between the ages of 12-16, I would yap and yap to anyone, and no, I didn\\'t make friends with everyone I talked to, but I made some, and was generally liked. As I got older, I cut off a group of friends from my home town because I had nothing in common with them and they were preoccupied with being popular and I wasn\\'t. My mam would always say that I needed more friends when she noticed I stopped hanging around them. I remember I brought 2 friends home for dinner and my sister said \"oh look, her friends. All 2 of them\". I became more aware of my loneliness. As my awareness increased, I got more withdrawn, basically a hermit, was overly critical of myself and overly self conscious. Because everyone around me was telling me it wasn\\'t okay to have few friends, even though I had been happy. Something that struck me in college was how everyone sort of acted as if they wanted to be perceived as popular. This was probably my warped SA perception, and this stopped me from talking to people. Sometimes I read threads here, particularly /r/relationships (my favourite sub) and see people talking about how having no friends is a \"red flag\" and that \"boring people finish last\" and that when you have no friends \"you\\'re the common denominator\" and there\\'s something wrong with you. I see where they\\'re coming from, and while reading things like this serves to make us all more self aware, it doesn\\'t make it easier, and it\\'s not healthy to blame yourself. I had an epiphany recently and I realized that... people in my hometown probably don\\'t talk about me negatively, if I talked to them they\\'d probably be open to me. People I meet daily that I think hate me, don\\'t hate me, if they do they\\'re basing it off one encounter, they don\\'t know me and I shouldn\\'t care. When I walk my dog, people who see me out in public don\\'t know I\\'m unemployed and friendless, or that my hair is really greasy. No one but me has felt my pain or understands, so screw it. Even if I have screwed up my reputation by being a recluse, it\\'s so easy to change how people see you, if you only have the courage to try. There\\'s no point in feeling guilt about SA. We are going to find friends at some point or another, our SA will die down eventually with personal growth or outside help. We might as well be okay with our circumstances in the meantime. I used to spend all my alone time (so, all the time) feeling bad about it, but what\\'s the point? That will only make me more bitter. Let\\'s stop acting like having no friends is the worst thing in the world. We\\'re not actually missing out on much, maybe this realization will help us to stop trying too hard in social situations and messing up. Loneliness is painful but only because other people make it painful by reminding us how flawed we are. I know it\\'s impossible to implement \"stop caring\" overnight, but please try. I hope other friendless people out there can get to the point in life where they don\\'t care what others think, because after 22 years it has finally freed me. *Tl;dr: People make us feel shit for not having friends. But realize if people didn\\'t make us feel shit about ourselves, we\\'d probably be okay. Try and get to the point where you realize that it\\'s okay to be who you are and be happy alone.

I remember as a child an incident where she went into the hospital because she mentally checked out because of the pain and when she woke up she lost her memory for two weeks. As a child I was confused as to why she couldn't remember me. So much has happened that I started blaming myself for the way she was and hated myself for living because she wouldnt be working so hard if she had me. I also have a special needs brother who she and I cared for also when his attendants working. I was home schooled so I missed out on my education because of caring for her full time. I did however get my GED in the year of 2014..this gave me confidence that I wasn't completely worthless and that I was capable of doing something other than playing video games and loathing in self-hate. I was sheltered and remember it being so bad I would only go outside once a month for a year. I wanted no parts of living but my Mom was my everything to keep going. I got to the point that I had to have a break, so I made plans for my Aunt to care for her just for me to leave to get myself together. This time I was gone, I found fitness, nutrition, yoga, meditation which made me feel happy and in control of something in my life for the first time. 7 months of this and I get a call that My Mom has passed away....I dont want to go too much further into it but ever since then I have lost that motivation and passion of waking up and feel myself sinking back into that sad girl who locked herself away from the world......I know it's something I have to do for myself and that I have to want it bad enough to break out of it but it's so hard and I never ask anyone for help...ever. I live with my boyfriend and hate burdening others with my problems so I keep it locked in. I figure posting this won't hurt. I have snapchat and instagram.

I\\'ll just get right into the story of what just took place. Incoming wall of text, bear with me. So I\\'m good friends with my neighbors and I was at their place hanging out when they decided they want to go bar hopping. They asked me if I wanted to go and I decided what the hell, why not? I\\'ve never been bar hopping, not even a bar since I turned 21 (in April. Normally I just go to the liquor store down the street and drink with my roommate or by myself). I told them I\\'ve never done it before so if they could guide me through it that\\'d be great, and they said sure. So it comes time to start walking. One of the guys is already drunk, the other is super experienced with this stuff. I felt so out of place. Not to mention they were wearing shirts that supported the home team (football game AND homecoming tonight, that alone should have told me it\\'d be way too busy for me to handle, especially for my first time at a bar). I was wearing what I normally wear, some jeans and a black sweater and nasty grey vans that I wore to work today and forgot to change out of. Not to mention these guys are way taller than me. I\\'m not even short, I\\'m 5\"11 but they were a few inches taller than me so all of this combined made me feel so out of place. So basically I was going into a social anxiety nightmare already anxious a fuck for other reasons than I was going out. Fuck. The walk took about 15 minutes, felt like forever, but when I got to the bar, I felt like it didn\\'t take long enough. This bar was packed beyond reason. Inside it didn\\'t look like there was anywhere to even move. And the line was massive. Halfway up, my friend decided now was the best time to mention there\\'s a $5 front. I didn\\'t know what that meant (in case someone doesn\\'t either, it means a $5 fee to get in). I had already told him I didn\\'t have any cash on me but he said don\\'t worry, they take debit cards. Here\\'s where I really start to panic. I ask if he can spot me and he said no, I should have brought cash with me. Fucking hell. Second panic: the people behind me are so close, like they kept brushing up against me and bumping into me. I can\\'t stand people touching me unexpectedly. But I\\'m at a bar, obviously that happens. But I start to freak out thinking the people around me can hear me say I don\\'t have the money, asking me friend, not knowing what to do, thinking they think I\\'m a loser for not knowing how to do this. I\\'m just about to leave because I\\'m about to have a break down. I tell my \"friend\" I think I\\'m just going to bail. He\\'s like yea okay whatever. I then start thinking the people behind me are thinking I\\'m even more of a loser for bailing and not doing what everyone else is doing. I end up saying fuck it and I start walking away. I walked towards the Taco Bell across the street and call my roommate and ask him to pick me up there. He said he was actually on his way to his girlfriend\\'s. I said oh never mind then, I don\\'t want you to drive all that way. He said it\\'s not a big deal and he comes to pick me up. Now I feel bad about inconveniencing him. So now I\\'m home by myself and alone with my thoughts and self loathing. I already told my boss I\\'m not coming in tomorrow because I\\'m going out, further inconveniencing someone else. Thinking about getting drunk as hell just to say tonight wasn\\'t a complete waste. I don\\'t know what I was thinking, going out for my first time to a bar on one of the busiest nights. I just felt like a turd the whole time and felt like I fucked things up over and over again. Sorry for the huge rant. Anyone else have similar experiences they want to share because of their SA? Update: it\\'s 2:39 am now and I\\'m alone and drunk. Friend told me the night ended being shit anyway, they didn\\'t get into the really busy bar. They went to one crappy bar and I turned out to be a really shitty night all around for them. Also I guess someone threw away or ate the other half of my McChicken that I left at their place and now I\\'m sad.\\')', 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with negative effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect', 'outdoor activity or space with positive effect'], 'scores': [0.45170068740844727, 0.32151928544044495, 0.2267800271511078]}\n",

            "{'sequence': '(\\'As a homeschooler, I feel like something was stolen from me.. Hello everyone. This is my first time posting here, I\\'ll try to keep it simple and organized. I have been homeschooled from Pre-K to senior year, and I am 18 now. For the most part I have been oblivious to the public perception of this method of teaching. I see everywhere online that it\\'s kind of frowned upon. People say that homeschoolers are anti-social white-trash potential school shooters. Everytime I see these comments I feel a strong pang in my chest. I actually don\\'t consider myself to be very weird, I am kind of average to be honest. I am obsessed with music, love my netflix, and enjoy travelling. Not very weird I wouldn\\'t think. I try very hard to hide the fact that I was homeschooled, simply because I immediately get lumped into these stereotypes. As a homeschooler, I feel like something was stolen from me. I never asked to be different. It doesn\\'t feel fair to me that I have this burden of an alternate lifestyle. I think it kind of stems from my personality. I hate conflict and hostile opinions. Which might be caused by my homeschooling. Such a mess right? My mother has a strong passion for homeschooling, and I remember her telling me that she would cry if I decided (or got forced by CPS) to go to public school. This created a sort of \"guilty conscious, or feeling that I have to stick with the program to keep her happy. She would actually threaten to \"put me in public school\" if I tried to talk to her about my doubts. Don\\'t get the wrong idea about her though, I love her and can kind of see where she\\'s coming from. She may have had a bad time in high school, so it\\'s like a terror to her. But, I don\\'t feel like I would have had the same experience. Sometimes I daydream about what I could have been like if I went to public school. Maybe I would some kind of sauve marauder! Or at least I would be assertive enough, self-relient, and have a good group of friends. Instead, I am just an awkward burden for most people my age. I feel like I was cheated a better life almost. I also have extreme insecurities when it comes to intelligence. Actually, anytime I think I see proof of my being stupid, I respond emotionally. Again, the pang in my chest feeling. I feel like my education could have been better, for the past few years I have mainly been teaching myself because my mom is hella busy. I am working on my ACT and I\\'ll hopefully get into college, which I am not sure I can do since I am a homeschooler. I don\\'t even know if I have a GPA, because there hasn\\'t been any kind of grading going on, not that I know of anyway. I am really good at math, but not so good at factoid/common-sense stuff. Right now I am in a jiu-jitsu class (free at my gym) and my instructor will constantly ask for a factoid, like \"How much blood is in the body?\" or \"What\\'s the fastest animal on Earth\". I couldn\\'t answer either of these, and it really bothers me. I feel like I should know this stuff, and I might have known it if I was in public school. Sometimes I will know one, but can\\'t think of it fast enough. Somehow, I always end up looking like an idiot in front of my class. Whether it be not answering questions, or having an insanely hard time with directions and spatial awareness. Yes, the homeschooling was for religious reasons. My mom says it\\'s because she met a homeschooler and was impressed, but I kind of doubt that. She\\'s an extreme Christian of sorts. She taught me creation science for a while, but I learned how it\\'s fraudulent. I have a basic understanding of evolution now, but I probably don\\'t know as much as other people my age. She\\'s also a big conspirator. Alex Jones, 9/11 Truth, FEMA, etc. I believed these too, but have since shaken them off. I am actually still in the closet about a lot of this stuff because I don\\'t want to have a heated discussion with her. I am still a Christian, but I have a lot of problems with religion. I guess it\\'s more of a personal thing that I don\\'t feel the need to express or go to church for. I have never had a girlfriend. I have never even had a kiss before. I have held hands with a girl and I took one on a date. But, the date was a disaster (she was kind of a bitch, and she didn\\'t consider it to be a date) and the \"holding hands\" part grossed me out. It\\'s starting to drive me crazy in a way, I really want to experience love, romance, and sex are like. But I feel like I have been permanently cockblocked by my upbringing. I\\'ll probably die a virgin. Anytime I have been close to starting something up with a girl, my mom wasn\\'t too far behind me. I feel like once they see my mom and the interactions we have, they write me off as a \"momma\\'s boy\" and immediately lose any attraction they once had. I am actually a pretty attractive looking guy, but the way I am drives them away. I have never had a job (unless you could call mowing your grandmother\\'s grass a real job). I have a supreme fear of the unknown here. Like I feel like they won\\'t hire me because I am not the best at social skills. Or, I feel like I am going to fuck up really bad with whatever they assign for me. Or, I feel like I will get bullied by coworkers and have a horrible time there. The real world is a scary concept to me, I have seen how horrible people can be on the internet (especially with the \\'kys\\' and red hot angry comments). I feel like I am too soft for the world, too sheltered. I feel like I will get eaten alive almost. So, it creates a vicious cycle, I don\\'t know when I\\'ll get a job, or what job I will get. But I know I need to get one because I\\'ll need a source of income soon (I rarely spend my money, so I have a lot of it). Because I don\\'t have a job and don\\'t exactly have a \"rich family\". I don\\'t have a phone, or a car. I have to use my parents phone and car anywhere I go, and I hate it. It severely stifles my freedom. I couldn\\'t go do anything without them knowing, I know this for a fact. My dream is to shed the stereotypical image I have and live a meaningful life. I want to have good friends, a wife, a good job, a house, etc. I don\\'t want to be seen as that weird guy, or that loner, I want to be somebody. I don\\'t know where to start, even though I was brought up in a good household (no domestic violence or anything), I carry a lot of baggage.

            "{'sequence': \"('I negotiated a 10,000$ increase to my salary. Hello SA, I want to share with you guys a milestone that I never thought I’d ever reach, and furthermore, a milestone that the past me would never have even dreamt as possible. My hope is that I can inspire people to see that it is truly is possible for anyone to massively and significantly improve themselves and fight through their own social anxiety. Warning, this post is quite long, but if you enjoy reading about a person’s journey’s to self-improvement, then this post is for you. A bit of backstory on me. I’m 22 right now, but I’ve been fighting social anxiety ever since I was in fifth grade (that’s rounds out to about half of my life). For as long as I remember, I hated myself, and there was a multitude of reasons for this such as growing up poor in a rich area, being different from all my peers (mixed race, foreign sounding name, etc.), and not seeing a healthy relationship between my mother and father. The way I coped with my insecurities was through video games. Lots and lots of video games. It was so easy to escape the reality I hated by living in another one that made me feel alive. I did this for years and years, throughout middle school and especially through high school and into college. With all the time I invested into video games, I was severely underdeveloped in my social skills, and I’d even pit myself in the bottom 10% next to anti-social deaf people. Everywhere I go, I would avoid eye contact with people. I hated even going outside and seeing other people, because I just knew how awkward and weird they would think I am for the way I looked and the way I walked. Class was a nightmare. I’d try to sit in the back, and every time the teacher would call on me, my heart would race to the speed of light, and my voice would quiver as I attempted to formulate a semi-coherent sentence. By now you might be wondering how the hell did I transform from this video game addicted, socially awkward boy with low self-esteem into a person that could stand up for himself? Answer: I got tired. Tired of living life feeling like a piece of shit. Tired of not even being able to look into the mirror without cringing. Tired of thinking I wasn’t worth anyone’s time, and that I’ll die alone. And that’s when I discovered /r/socialanxiety. For the first time I saw that I wasn’t the only one in the world dealing with what I thought was my own unique personal hell. I heard stories, stories of peoples’ struggles, and even some of their success. But to be honest, I never found enough actionable advice here to steer my life in the right direction, so I started looking elsewhere. I started looking at other subreddits, and I even started reading self-improvement books and listening to podcasts. Somewhere around this point, something finally clicked in my head that me realize that change is possible, “even for me.” Here are three steps I followed to transform my life after believing that I could transform my life: Step 1) I started an exercise regimen and eating healthier. Even though my routine sucked and I made every mistake in the book, the small progress I made further made me see that I could improve my own physique through grit and not shoving junk food down my throat. Let’s not kid ourselves, appearances do matter, not so much that they should dominate every ounce of your thought and life focus, but I’ve come to learn that neglecting it and pretending like it doesn’t matter only perpetuated a cycle of negative thoughts about myself such as “I’ll never look good, I’m not like that, I’m ugly, etc.” If you feel ugly now, working out and dressing decently can unsurprisingly improve the way you feel about yourself. Try it. If you’re fighting social anxiety like I was, you’re going to need every bit of improvement you can get and this one can even be done without any social interaction (though that is against the road of improvement). Step 2) I started paying attention to my body language. I think this may be one of the hardest points to tackle as a person with SA, and I can’t even say that my own personal body language is in tip top shape as of yet, but I can say that even by being aware that body language exists puts you miles ahead of the average person with SA. So much communication is portrayed through the body, such as standing up straight, not looking down at the ground, and even just how you deal with silence. If you’re a guy and you’re into girls, this a quality that is heavily observed, much more so than the verbal communication. If you’re a girl, you probably know this and have more of knack for this than the average guy does. However complicated this may seem, simple things that I mentioned such as standing up straight and keeping your head-up can psychologically boost your mood. Step 3) I did things I was uncomfortable with, step by step. I think this is the hardest and most crucial step of my process, and it could be divided into countless sub-steps and stories, but I want to hit the main point that the only way to become comfortable is to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. Here’s an example. I’m at grocery store, I really don’t want to ask the worker for help finding an item. But I do it, just to see what will happen. I’m nervous. I approach her and ask where the broccoli is. She tells me it’s on aisle seven. “Shit I don’t where aisle seven is, should I ask her, no she’ll think I’m weird.” I nod okay and walk away quickly. “Shit, why didn’t I ask her to point me to where aisle seven is .“ I find another worker, then ask if he can show me to aisle seven, and sure enough he happily tells me where to go. I realize this isn’t so bad and am now not afraid to ask for directions. The point of this example is take small steps and experiment for yourself. The more you do, the more you will learn. And I hate to say it, but most of what we learn isn’t through others, but by our own doing, and especially doing things that we think will suck. Now I could tell my own personal stories on this topic for pages and pages, but I want to highlight that I’ve done things as uncomfortable as confronting someone about their shitty behavior, asking girls to dates (*gasp*, no way, how is that possible, as my old self would say), actually being on the date and making mistakes (learning mistakes I’ll have you know), and even performing on a stage in front of a live audience. But the most recent highlight is negotiating my salary at my current job. I did my research about my current job that I’m getting hired for, and I noticed that I was being heavily underpaid for the position. I knew that being underpaid would make me feel resentment as an employee and not allow me to do my best work, so I decided “fuck it, rather than have a terrible time at this position feeling passive-aggressive about my situation and being weird in the office, I’m going to tackle this right now.” I looked up as many negotiation tactics as possible, spent time in the shower for a week debating with my manager in my imagination, and finally reassured myself that I know my worth. I approached my manager 2 days ago. Long story short, I nailed the negotiation and got a 10k salary raise. All the uncomfortable things I ever dealt with leading up to this made me the person I was going into that negotiation. All the hard work, mistakes, pain, and learning that I did made me become someone who was worthy of that 10k raise. If you threw 16 year old, or even 20 year old socially awkward me into the same position, I would not have not have raised a single word. I probably would not have even passed the interview for this job. As long as this post has been, there’s so many details that I left out, but I really hope that I’ve demonstrated that it is truly is possible to fight your own social anxiety, and even use it as fuel to better yourself. I still have lots of room to grow, and I’m not the most socially savvy or charming person you’ll ever meet, but I can say with confidence and pride that I’m 100 times better than the person I used to be.')\", 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with negative effect', 'outdoor activity or space with positive effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect'], 'scores': [0.39380964636802673, 0.3489152789115906, 0.2572750151157379]}\n",
            "{'sequence': '(\\' Will soon be having a conversation with my manager about my SA... Hey guys. So I\\'m a lower level supervisor where I work and today I had to get together with a group of my co-workers and my manager to go over some things that they (co-workers) haven\\'t been completing on a consistent basis. Performance stuff basically. My manager and I had talked the night before about how we were going to approach the meeting and we agreed I would try and take the lead on most of the conversation and he would chime in when necessary. He, as well as a majority of management (big company, lots of higher-ups) know that I have some anxiety issues, but don\\'t really know the extent of it for the most part. So the meeting didn\\'t go all that great. Not terrible, but not very good. I started things off and kind of just nose dived into what the group of co-workers had done wrong the day before. No intro, no nice lead in or explanation as to why we were there. Just \"ok so this wasn\\'t done, that was dirty, this wasn\\'t taken care of..\" etc, etc. My manager ended up back-packing the meeting per usual and the day continued on as it normally would. Well towards the end of the day he wanted to get together again (just him and I) so that we could talk about how it went. We go into the same room where we held the meeting that morning which is this bright ass (like apple store bright) conference room and we start to chat. We go over some normal day to day stuff and then we get on the subject of how we think the meeting went. I told him I think it could have gone better and he agrees which is why he wanted to talk with me to begin with. I told him I\\'m particularly aware of my public speaking difficulties and that I know I could have directed the meeting in a more constructive way. I told him I struggle with certain things and that I\\'ve been devoting a lot of time outside of work to try and help with that stuff. Then he stopped me and asked me what type of struggles.. I paused for a second and said \"oh, well I have anxiety and uh..\" pause, not looking at him.. \"it\\'s just been really hard and, uh..\" At this moment I started to well up with tears. He could tell I was on the verge of crying and I knew I would if I said anything else so I told him I needed to step away for a second. So I stepped into an empty office and just tried to wait out the emotion. I was completely, utterly overwhelmed. After a couple minutes he came over and asked me if I\\'d Iike to walk outside with him for a bit. We took a walk around the neighboring businesses while I, thoroughly embarrassed, stammered out the few sentences of explanation that I could (I should say that my manager is a really good dude, fairly close to my age and also super understanding). He let me know that he\\'s all ears if I\\'d like to try and talk about everything at a later time as I was just about finished with my shift for the day. I told him that I\\'ve actually been wanting to do that for a while so we agreed that he\\'d give me a call within the next couple of days to discuss things.. I know I need to talk about a lot with him, I just don\\'t know *how* much. Do I tell him the full truth? That I\\'m severely depressed because of my SA and that if affects me every day of my life? That it drastically inhibits my ability to perform as a supervisor? I was on the verge of breaking down at work which is something I\\'ve never done, ever. Let alone in front of my boss. I\\'ve spent my whole life trying to hide my SA and have developed an ultra thick, guarded wall as a result. I\\'ve avoided these types of conversations with people (other than my family) because of how overwhelming the emotions become. I\\'m scared that if I completely open up to him I\\'ll raise serious questions about my ability to perform my job requirements. Either way, the dynamic between him and I will absolutely not be the same after this convo. This post became way, waay longer than I meant it to be. Cheers if you made it all the way to the end. Thank you..sincerely, for any responses. TL;DR I ended up nearly crying in front of my manager after being overwhelmed with emotions when asked to elaborate on my struggles with SA. We planned a follow up conversation at a later time so that I can gather myself and allow for a proper explanation. Now I\\'m just not sure how much I want to share with him as I\\'m scared it might jeopardize my job, or at least my standings within my department. \\')', 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with negative effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect', 'outdoor activity or space with positive effect'], 'scores': [0.3749781847000122, 0.34277787804603577, 0.28224390745162964]}\n",

I wasn't shy I could male new friends and talk to other kids with no worries at all. I went to a school that was k-8 I stayed there all the way till 8th grade and so did pretty much everyone from my starting kindergarten class did the same so we were real close shared birthday parties , had sleepovers all of us were on a soccer team for a good while. But at around 5th grade i started to get a bit chubby i dont know if it was pubery or my aunt always giving me treats. And the same friends who i had known since kindergarten started teasing me not all but most also we were kinda finding who we were and making our groups of friends. So this put me down to where i didnt wanna go to birthday parties anymore or do things with them because i knew I would be made fun of or called fat or asked why my face was red all the time so i started staying home alot. My dad didn't like this so he would make me go to these events where i would be teased. I never told him and I would have to make a scene to not go. So he gave up on me going and i kinda just stayed at home all the way till we graduated till 8th grade I wasn't the weird kid everyone made fun of i had friends i guess I just got used to being teased brushed it off and all that bit it bothered me i would have breakdowns cry askingy parents if I was fat. I went to a different high school then everyone else didn't grt teased and felt a bit better i geaduated got in shape and all but all of that just kinda left a mark.

Those who are ‘meant’ to read this  and offer guidance, will. I hope :) No idea how to cut it down into a TLDR as it is far too lengthy. I'll try to keep this first backstory as short  and to the point as possible. I'm 21, live in Australia on the east coast, grew up in Sydney and lived there until I was 18. I have a sister who is 7 years older who still lives in our hometown. Lost my father at a young age at 13. I've been battling depression for over 5 years since I was 15. I moved 2 hours away from my hometown at 18  and my depression got much worse. I stopped seeing friends, stopped going out, stopped talking to my friends/family which led to dealing with anxiety issues which led to social anxiety due to isolating myself. (Among other symptoms) I've recently started seeing a psychologist, getting out of the house more, I'm finally starting to feel like going out  and doing things. I want to meet people. I've been out more/done more in January of this year than I have the past 2 years. Finally starting to feel 'normal'. I still haven't reconnected with any of my old friends. I haven't posted anything on my personal social media accounts (Facebook/Instagram/Snapchat) since I first moved in late 2014. Haven't spoken to any friends since then  and haven't seen them either. Some have reached out to me but I never replied. Haven’t had a job since I moved up here either. For some reason I'm still afraid to reach out to them because I know that will lead to eventually meeting up with them in person. I'm even afraid to post anything on social media from fear of them reaching out to me. Because I know this will lead down the same route. I haven't made any new friends since moving from my hometown, haven't worked or studied  and basically feel like a complete failure. Afraid of what they will say, think or feel about me cos I have no life per say. I have already made a post looking for advice/guidance regarding the issue related to my old friends, however the above context was necessary to lead onto my next story which I am solely looking for advice/guidance for. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ New years eve I went to a house party with my older Sister cos I had nothing else to do, literally, and met all her friends etc. People were drinking, majority of people were on drugs, MDMA, LSD  and Ketamine was available. I hadn’t had drugs for 3 years since Australia day in 2014 when I was 18. I didn’t plan on taking anything. I met a girl who lived there, friend of my sisters who’s my age - lets call her Mary. I was told by a few people she thought I was attractive  and wanted to hookup. I haven’t hooked up with anyone for over 2 years and I actually was thinking that about her anyway so I was keen. I was drinking a lot when I first got there because of my anxiety, meeting new people etc. and ended up having to stop drinking because I was getting sick mixing it with weed. (Only drank 4 times last year so I had a very low tolerance). A few hours later I was in Marys room with her, my sister  and another girl who lived there just talking; lets call her Barbara. Barbara asked if we all wanted to get any more MDMA caps (her bf had stuff people could buy during the night). All of them had already taken an MDMA cap each earlier on in the night  and they all said yeah to having another one, which left me to decide; I ended up asking for one since I felt comfortable, didn’t feel pressured by them and the moment felt right to do it (granted my judgement was way off cause I was drinking/smoking; not the best idea to jump on drugs with people you barely know, but I felt safe being with my sister). So I took mine with them  and they left me and Mary in the room not long after. Started talking to Mary, getting to know her and all that. Basically having a d andm. She was telling me that she is going overseas this year to a US summer camp for 6 weeks. I felt so unaccomplished  and like a loser basically because there’s no way I could do that. I told her she’s really ambitious  and we started talking about other things while smoking weed together. We ended up hooking up for awhile, kissed at midnight  and started talking more after that. At one point while we were outside having a cigarette, she asked me to tell her ‘my life story’, it caught me off guard cos if I’m honest I don’t even know what it is. I got about halfway through  and somehow we got interrupted and I never got to hear hers or finish mine. I realised I was saying a lot of bad things that had happened in my life, rather than who I am and what I do? Anyway, Mary  and Barbara decided to come back with me, my sister  and her partner back to their place about an hour or two after Midnight to spend the rest of the night together. They were all going to take a tab of LSD each when we got back, I didn’t want to have psychedelics so I had a second MDMA cap. When we got back to my sisters place , Mary  and Barbara lost an acid tab when we got there. Eventually we all gave up looking for it  and they all took a tab each. Not long after taking the tab it got kinda weird with her, her vibe changed  and she wasn’t talking much, we weren’t as ‘close’ physically as earlier (not cuddling n stuff) but we were holding hands? They were all waiting for the LSD to kick in  and everyone wasn’t really talking much, and cos I hadn’t taken a tab I wasn’t on the same ‘level’. I think that’s where things changed cos my 2nd MDMA cap was coming on while her tab was coming on so we were on different wavelengths. We were all chilling in the lounge room laying down for about an hour and it was pretty obvious Barbara was the 5th wheel. Mary, her friend  and my sister went into her room and were talking for awhile. Eventually they came out and we all went for a cigarette on the balcony and they basically came and said they were leaving. They were going to stay the night then an hour or two later after we got back they said they were leaving cos her friend wanted to be with her boyfriend. I was too out of it to leave the unit  and when I said ‘I’m too f*cked to leave when Mary asked me if I was coming she said 'well your ambitious’. Never has my gut dropped so much. Instant regret. Such a horrible feeling, intensified by the drugs. I’m sure they left cos they started feeling uncomfortable being there, particularly Marys friend being the 5th wheel without her BF on new years eve. My sister, her partner  and I all planned on coming back to their placed to end the night there regardless, a safe place to come back to. So we kind of all had it in our head that we weren’t leaving after we got back. Looking back I wish I went back with Mary  and her friend but it probably wasn’t the best idea because they ended up taking another tab and ‘day-tripped’. Which could have ended up quite messy since it was pretty messy after they left anyway just being with my sister n her partner. Who knows what would happened - I never will know cos I chose not to go. I told my sister n her partner the next morning what Mary said when she left  and I asked them if I screwed up by not going back with her - my sisters husband said yeah i thought I heard her say something like that but my sister sort of dismissed it. They were both pretty adamant that I hadn’t ‘fucked up’ though - the next day my sister said she spoke to Mary on FB and asked her about what she said before she left that night  and she said that she didn't say that at all, something like 'oh alright then' was what she apparently said but I didn't really believe it. Mary sent me a message first on snapchat a couple days after new years basically saying ‘hey was nice to meet you had a nice time  and we said we should chill n have a sesh sometime’ etc. So we started talking a little bit, went to buy weed from their place a day later  and added her on FB but didn’t ask for her number. Such an idiot. Anyway, It was my sisters birthday the first week of 2017  and she had a party the first weekend (7th Jan - Saturday), Mary  and I were both going so we were going to catch up there. I was talking to her leading up to my sisters bday party after i came home on the Thursday and then the next night I had a panic attack after smoking some weed (happened cos of repressed emotions from traumatic domestic event in late 2016)  and went to the doctor the next morning for a referral to a psychologist along with some sort of temporary medication to help me sleep  and I haven't spoken to her since. And with all my anxiety i'm afraid to even talk to her because its been over a month and she probably thinks I’m a rude douchebag but then again she may not even think twice about it. My sister said she knows I have a lot going on in my life at the moment so she probably doesn’t mind. I felt like I got attached to her way too quickly after that night, or perhaps attached to the idea of potentially being with someone? Since it had been so long since I’ve actually had that physical connection with someone it was quite difficult to just ‘let go’ and forget about it. I became afraid of this attachment and decided to stop talking to her to detach myself, I didn’t want to come across as needy or obsessive. Couldn’t stop thinking about her for 2 weeks afterwards. Avoiding talking to her ended up making me think of her more. She hasn’t messaged me since I didn’t reply to her last message so as far as she’s concerned she may not even think about me at all? When I was younger I used to talk to girls day  and night (not exactly proud of it) but my point is I had confidence, I wasn't anxious or insecure - like I’m too afraid to even message Mary? I just feel awkward after hooking up with her, when I went to her place  and added her on FB I was so awkward around her, didn’t know how to act around her after hooking up  and being so f*cked from the drugs lol - I just want to be able to talk to her and get to know her,  and i don’t really feel like getting to know her through text is how I want to do it either, I’d rather do it in person. But then I’m awkward in person after hooking up lol, don’t how to be. Don’t know what to do, she keeps popping in my head. Feel like I’m not worthy enough, not enough self worth  and confidence. No job, no car, no license, no friends, what do I have to offer? I lift weights, I’m fit, I’m healthy, I’m intelligent, I’m educated, own my own business, I feel like I’m attractive - definitely not ugly, but can barely bring myself to message her on Facebook. Am I just mentally stuck on this whole thing? Do I need to let it go  and move on? I know the next move would be to reach out to her again  and eventually ask to meet up in person  and go from there. But my social anxiety is stopping me. I feel like there is a lot that has gone unsaid between us that should be spoken about  and idk if thats me overthinking it but I don’t even know how to bring that up to her either. I feel so weird thinking all of this when I barely know her. I just don’t know what to do, or how to ask her how she feels about the whole thing cos apparently she got out of a year long relationship herself  and according to my sister ‘she probably isn’t looking for anything’. So as far as Mary is concerned it may have just been a one time thing to hook up on New Years; I don’t know her well enough to make that judgement and don’t feel comfortable enough to talk to my sister about it anymore cos I told her about getting attached and she made me feel like a complete idiot for being like that. Idk if it was because I was on MDMA (I know it dissolves boundaries  and you generally have a better connection with other people, the ‘love drug’, very euphoric) but I was drawn to her in a way I have never experienced before (before taking the MDMA), normally I'm sexually attracted to girls like yeah I find her attractive but that's not what drew me too her - idk how to explain it. Like a deeper connection? I don’t want to say like a soul mate, but I’ve never felt a connection like this with a person before? But then again it could be a superficial connection with the drugs. I really have no idea! Any opinions/advice/guidance would seriously be appreciated so much! I have no one to talk to about this. I got about a 1/3 way through the story with my psychologist in todays session  and it’s just eating me up inside! I want to get out of this mental rut!

I was embarrassed and didn't ask her out again and after that I didn't go out with someone for about a year.

I also kept thinking about how to make a move but I would just get super freaked out about the whole thing because I wasn't sure how to make a move without bringing up my feelings. Yet again I was in bed with a girl I liked but could not do anything about it because the first two relationships I was in ended with my rejection by them. She then started to see that guy and they started to date each other but in February they broke up for a 2nd time. We started to hang out more after they broke up and 2-3 weeks ago we started to go out once or twice a week. We went to a bar and then went to a park later that week.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'Up  and Out, Not Down  and In. Over the more than 20 years that I battled social anxiety before finally overcoming it, I developed the concept of “up and out, not down and down and in”. This sounds simple but it was incredibly effective. It was a little reminder I would give myself that I applied specifically to my gaze and body language in order to turn around any situation where I could feel myself becoming very socially anxious and potentially losing control and spiralling into a full-blown anxiety attack or “episode”. Having had SA for most of my life, I developed a very intimate relationship with it and one of the most interesting things I noticed about it, was that it has most power when not faced - either figuratively or literally. I found it was most potent when left to wreak havoc in that space just out of the corner of your eye or mind’s eye. That couple you can kind of see out of the corner of your eye in the coffee shop and can hear laughing, but are too anxious to turn to look at - you just \"know\" they are laughing at you. You start to feel awkward and you become certain they are giggling more at how conspicuously uncomfortable you are becoming. The book you were originally reading, you are now only using as a prop as a place to fix your eyes. You can feel your thoughts starting to race and feel yourself spiralling towards an anxiety attack. You just \"know\" they can see your excruciating awkwardness and your redness and sweating starting to build, and are delighting in it with those shrill laughs. That person you see coming towards you on the pavement. You’ve only taken a quick glance from 30 yards away, but you can just immediately \"tell\" that it’s that person that used to bully you at school. Your heart explodes and you start to feel it pumping in your neck - not just your chest. You feel sick from the adrenaline. Your head drops, your shoulders round over. Pull out your phone and pretend to take a call so you can turn around? Cross the street? Look at the ground, look at the ground, walk as fast as you can. Let’s just get through this. Why the hell does this kind of stuff always happen to me? Any of this sound familiar? In these (perceived) stressful situations your gaze drops submissively downwards, your attention turns inwards to your own racing thoughts and heartbeat, and your body begins to curl up into a defensive ball - shoulders come up to the ears as if to protect yourself from an imminent blow, arms fold across the chest and the head drops. It was at exactly such moments that I would remind myself of “up and out, not down and in”. As I felt my body and thoughts being crushed by the weight of what I believed was happening around me in situations like those above, I would deliberately push back against it. I would bring my head and gaze up, sit upright, take a deep breath and stretch as if I was uncomfortable from sitting too long, push out my chest and turn my awareness outwards. As I stretched, as if yawning, I would take a good look around the room. And when I did, I found something incredible happened... I found that these nightmare-ish scenarios that I thought were unfolding around me existed as mere phantoms in the corner of my eye and mind’s eye - in my physical and mental peripheral vision as it were. When I turned to look at what was really happening it was as if the scales fell from my eyes and I was awoken from a bad dream. Where I imagined terrible demons looming up, there were only pleasant everyday people, going about their lives. The couple in the coffee shop were a pair of young lovers, so into each other and canoodling so much they hadn’t even noticed me, let alone given a f*ck about what I was doing. The guy walking toward me on the pavement wasn’t that guy from school 20 years ago. I had just managed to project my worst fears onto him and make his face morph into someone else. Amy Cuddy has talked at length about the link between posture and mind, and I find that this “making myself big” brings about an immediate change in me mentally. It is effectively a way of striking a “power pose” and this change in physical state brings about a change in the mind and body - even changing hormone levels! It’s as if I am physically throwing off the pressure which I had been allowing to build up on me, which in turn was shrinking my posture down physically into a weaker and more submissive pose. This then becomes a downward spiral as submissive body language feeds into ever more negative thoughts...and on and on. As I look around the room in such instances or face the person I was worried about, I turn myself from a feeling of the passively observed to potent observer. The gaze is a very powerful thing and can be used very effectively in dealing with social anxiety. In the coffee shop example, as I look around, I see normal people doing their own thing - reading books, listening to podcasts, scrolling through their phones - not the rows of judging faces pointing and laughing at me that I had let build up in my mind’s eye. This technique can be used in any anxiety-inducing situation where you have enough space to avoid yourself shrinking down under the weight of your anxious thoughts. Even if speaking in public or another situation where you feel scrutinised and unable to make exaggerated movements there are still changes you can make to bring about the same effect. For example, if speaking in public you can strike a power pose by widening your stance, leaning forward with both hands on the lectern and bringing your chin up. You can also scan the room to engage people individually with eye contact. In this way, the blurry sea of judgemental “audience” “out there”, becomes individuals with their own features and expressions. I also use it a lot on buses, trains and airplanes where I would find walking past rows and rows of seated passengers while I looked for a seat very stressful. But I find this is most effective on the subway, which i historically found a very stressful and anxiety-inducing environment. The more I would be sucked down into looking at my phone or book (which i was only pretending to engage with because I was becoming anxious - and increasingly so the more I believed people were starting to notice how uncomfortable I was) the more my thoughts would race, the redder I would get and the greater the feeling of losing control and spinning into an anxiety attack was.The spell could only be broken by “up and out, not down and down and in” - looking up, posturing up and turning my attention outwards. On subway trains now I spend a lot of the time enjoying the luxury of leisurely looking around the carriages. I try not to stare at anyone as I’m sure there are many people there with their own self-consciousness and anxiety issues that don’t want any unwarranted excessive attention. But I do enjoy the newfound ability to let my gaze roam around, register people’s faces and see that no one is out to get me or laugh at me or judge me.

As soon as I came to the bar I felt intense anxiety. People sat around their tables, talking actively and having fun and I felt like a proper dickhead joining them uninvited and talking nervously. So, so, so many awkward encounters, cold approaches, trying to bum cigarettes, half-assedly asking for directions, getting made fun of by chads and even bouncers.

Around midnight I said fuck it and gave up. I walked to an E-sports bar and sat down there with a group of people. They were nice and welcoming and we talked about video games. They were boring though and I just sighed out eventually. They started ignoring me completely and just chatted with each other about boring shit. A guy that sat with his friends at another table smiled at me as he saw me sit alone. He waved to me and shouted ''Come over here man!''. This was the turning point of the night for me. I talked for soo long with this guy about a game called PLAYER UNKNOWN BATTLEGROUNDS and he taught me so much.

I have never had a gf, i am a virgin and i havent been kissed.. im not an ugly fucker, but no ryan gosling either. yesterday i went out rather reluctantly with a uni friend as i had just finished my degree.. it was a uni event anyways i planned on just drinking in my sorrows and such which i did, but i was finding it kinda nice. My friend was there with her bf and her other friend. We got along rather well. Sure enough the 4 of us got bored and went to do our own thing. Her friend lets call her \"eve\" (lol) and i danced and drank a bit. I kinda broke out into salsa or similar and started holding hands with her damcing around. I dunno what was going through my mind (other than alco) but i did find her cute (she was indian or similar) we grinded a little as well and kept saying stupid things to one another about the place and i kept making sure not to charge across her boundaries but also break the touch barrier.. we held hands while dancing heaps. my two other friends left early and i took this chance to ask her to go for a walk.. sure enough we did and we ate shitty fast food on the way back to where ahe was staying.. at the top of the stairs i had to give her back her shoes (i was carrying them because they hurt her feet) i asked her if she wanted her shoes back and she said \"maybe, is that what you want?\" i said \"idk maybe its not\" she said \"maybe you want something else\" i said \"maybe i do\" we smiled and she leant in for a kiss snd i met it. We made out for a little bit and i said \"thats more like it\" we did it again and i hugged her around her lower back.. i told her that was my first kiss and she was kinda shocked.. then she told me hers and how it was weird. We kept talking and we kissed again. Then we said we have to go on a date. Then added each other on fb. I left with her and then we said goodbye. Whatever happens now doesnt bother me. I feel kinda concrete when it happened.. like i wasnt passionate enough. She was into it but i kinda wasnt because of my anxiety.. but i managed to wing the whole episode. We seemingly had a bit in common (not much of a social life) and kinda pissed with the world. We played 20 questions while eating shitty fast food and i asked if anyone ever complimented her on her eyes. They were dark brown and matched her skin. She was so cute. All this happened in a 5 hour period. I guess we clicked and we also related on similar things. I still see her eyes looking up at me while we were dancing. She smaller than me and i liked it.

As part of a New Years resolution, I decided I was going to start saying yes to events instead of being cozied up at home all the time. I should note that I’ve been homeschooled through K-12, hence never having walked in a classroom. I won’t lie, I was really nervous leading up to, and partly during the event. I played some indie folk music on the way to try to soothe my nerves. As soon as I pull my car over the hill with the intersection, I witnessed just what I’d be getting myself into. Cars were everywhere. It was a real turn out. There were over 200 people in attendance. I find a parking spot at another building, and I’m just thinking of home. Home where I don’t have to worry about sounding stupid or accidentally having a social faux pas. I push out my chest and walk towards the line. I wasn’t expecting a line. So I mozy on to the back of the line, occasionally looking at my phone so I would blend in with most of the high school kids that were there (I’m 19 with a full beard who is out of the loop on current technology). I couldn’t get a WiFi connection, so I was just switching between settings and the browser the whole time, hopefully looking like I was doing something. The line crawls, and I’m just switching between looking up and at my phone. I make it to the walk up registration, and tell them my name and what not. It seems like it went ok. I walked up and just found the quickest seat I could so I wouldn’t have to be seen walking up by everyone. I sit down and immediately this dude asks if I play vidya games. So I tell him I play fortnite. He starts asking if I watch this particular twitch streamer, I say no. The conversation kind of fizzles out after. Wondering if I seemed boring? Moments later I hear him say to one of his friends “you want to get drunk later?”. At that moment I’m having a little bit of a culture shock. I’ve never drank alcohol. Does everyone booze in HS? I felt kind of uncomfortable. Finally the presentation begins. It’s pretty basic, and I could have got more information from the website. There is a point during the presentation where they play this website quiz game from the school. I can’t partake because my WiFi won’t work, so I just watch the results. I would have got most of them wrong if I tried. Yikes. I was taking notes, but not paying attention to the right stuff evidently. So after that, the whole room is being split off into tour groups. I am paying full attention because I don’t want to screw up and go off with the wrong group. Thankfully I do get the right one. At this point I’m standing alone with a bunch of strangers. Most are with someone else. The tour seems to go fine, there were these three really obnoxious teenagers who were fucking off for the most part though. They didn’t bother me thankfully. Our tour ends and it’s on to the last event (which I wasn’t aware of until later.) Its basically a few different stands promoting different fields of study and social events (almost none of which pertained to my major of choice or my personal interests.) I talk to a few of them anyways. I won’t lie, it was really awkward. I kept tripping over my words, speaking in broken English, and my mind went completely blank a few times while in the middle of conversations. I honestly wonder if this hurt my chances of being enrolled. I didn’t have many good questions either. Afterwards I sat at a table and fidgeted on my phone, then I realized it was for the most part over, and a wave of calm came over me. I realized I could leave! Since I didn’t have anyone to talk to, what was the point of staying any longer? So I walked a long walk back to my car and headed home. That was it. Only part worth it was touring the campus honestly. Well it wasn’t a perfect attempt at integrating into society, but it’s progress nonetheless. I’m proud that I did this instead of wondering what it would have been like at home. It was awkward and I didn’t connect with anyone. I’m afraid more will follow when I do (eventually) enroll there.

My parents would still force me to go outside sometimes when they felt I had spent too much time on the computer (no internet of course), even though there was literally nothing for me to do except maybe throw a frisbee at my brother who is four years younger than me (a huge age difference for a preteen). My parents weren\\'t narcissistic or religious nuts, maybe a bit overprotective, but I feel like the rules they had for me prevented me from making friends in my early development, which is of course a very important time to make friends. And what\\'s worse is I think they relaxed their rules for my younger sibling, and now he\\'s in high school and from what I\\'ve heard he has lots of friends and does school sports and other extracurriculars. I would not be surprised if he has his first relationship before me (maybe I shouldn\\'t think this way, but the day that happens is the day that whatever meager self worth I have will be extinguished).

            "{'sequence': '(\\'Has anyone else experienced this or something like it?. This is gonna be a very long and personal post to an extent with some background detail for clarity. Hopefully someone will read through and offer some advice or likeness. Okay, so I have been someone who suffers from social anxiety since I was about 8. Before that I was actually very outgoing and was social at my preschool/first grade/second grade. Many things contributed to my social anxiety and thus my life long battle of depression. The first notable thing was my teachers bullying me for having ADHD and telling me I was too disruptive. The second notable thing was my best friend in second grade ended up ignoring me because the popular girl in the class disliked me as I was very active and bubbly. So, that\\'s some backstory, and ever since then I have been an internet recluse. Everytime I tried to make friends they used me and then bullied me verbally and mentally until at 13 I quit going to school and outside completely. Internet gaming, specifically MMOs is all I\\'ve had since. Fast forward, I am now nearing 22. I go to college, have a job, and a boyfriend of nearly 5 years. Everything on that aspect is fine (or better than expected for now) but...I fucked myself over socially. When I was 16 I made a friend group despite my social anxiety. The internet is easier to socialize on for me, even though I still can\\'t order a pizza over the phone or make a Dr. Appointment irl. I\\'ve had these friends since 16 for a very stable period, but last year I had a complete social anxiety attack and went haywire. I removed everyone, blocked them, and vanished for 2 months. I tried to come back and explain what happened, but no one was having it. One friend who was very close, even responded \"lol good\" when she heard I was struggling. I tried to reach out people to ask why I was being treated this way and they would get mad at each other for telling me something and then I got backlash for trying to reconnect and put the pieces of my social life back together. This has been extremely debilitating for me and I have relapsed to my pre-social ways. I apologized and told them I\\'d stop bothering them, to which they never responded to except that they didn\\'t need the drama. What bothers me most is that to make these friends, I put myself out there and listened to when THEY were upset. I specifically remember two of them were genuinely suicidal and I talked them through their troubles. One of them said she won\\'t speak to me because I am only trying to talk to her because no one else will and I need someone. Well....yeah. Is this not what normal friends do? Anyways, I apologized to them all and removed them because I was only a bother and annoying. I keep having small breakdowns and it\\'s leaking out in my relationship and work. Today at work the assistant manager seen me act very atypical and asked me if I was okay to which I kind of laughed in a hollow tone and said no and walked away. Everyone at work noticed and I started having an anxiety attack mid rush (I work at a pizza place so it can get work heavy on weekends). What do I do now? Has anyone else experienced this and has found a way to cope or just experienced this in general? I want to make new friends...but I just feel like a teen again and like everyone hates me. TL;DR: I was social for awhile, had an anxiety attack, got isolated, and now I have nothing.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'Everyone hates me and what I\\'ve learned from it. This is going to be a weird post and hopefully it fits here well. I never thought of this as a social anxiety, but it actually is kind of, correct me if I\\'m wrong I\\'m new to Reddit. I\\'ve been hated. Even since preschool. Not by my family by all means, and people liked members of my family by the way. It seemed like people only outside of my family hated me. Strangers, classmates, coworkers, anyone I came into contact with besides my family hates me. I was always the quiet one and the weird one. I never minded either. I fed off of their hate. Anytime I got bullied I would fight back. Like you know when they say fight or flight? Yea I was the fighter. I would lash out and do exactly what they did to me. Or I would cry and show them exactly how it made me feel right then and there, almost as a joke but filled with rage. I didn\\'t really get embarrassed. I was really good at doing embarrassing things and be okay with it most of the time. I preferred to be alone. I never liked it When people tried to become my friend. Like why are you texting me and calling me? Please leave me alone. For some reason I did actually become friends with the other unliked kid. I would see people snicker at them and see them as weird. Here\\'s a little story: There was one girl in middle school. Her name was Jane. She had long black hair, pale skin and bright hazel eyes. The kids were literally afraid of her and thought she was weird I wasn\\'t afraid of her and I was fascinated in her. I also felt empathy for her. I could relate to her of being unliked. End of short story. Weird part about enjoying being alone is I\\'ve always had a boyfriend since the beginning of high school. The boyfriends were always cool and well liked by others. The boyfriends were all similar in their own ways, we all broke up mutually, calmly and on good terms. The boyfriends all gave me respect, friendship and trust. The cool boys always liked Jane as well and she always had a cool boyfriend too! Other boys thought we were the \"funniest, raddest, coolest, best to be around\" chicks out there. Or so they say. So I guess what I should have said in the beginning of this entire post is, most girls hate me. So truth be told, not everyone hates me. This has been a lie for my whole life. I believed as a small child up until early adulthood is that everyone hated me was far from the truth. One day I had enough. I tried to kill myself. Slit my wrists and wanted to bleed out. Well it didn\\'t work, I didn\\'t die and I should have gotten stitches. So I decided that day I will never try again left with awful scars. I still hated my life and the fact everyone hated me. I fell again in these ideas I created. Sure there was hard proof for people hating me. They hated the way I looked, the way I dressed, my hair. They spread rumors, they prank phone called me, tried to best me up. I had a girl send me a 10 page text message saying I lie about every story I ever told her . The words this girl said to me hurt me deeply. I cried and cried. I worked with her and I had to face her. I was terrified of her and I wondered \"why me\" It was a pattern. Some girls simply just didn\\'t like me. There was nothing I could say or do any differently. You might be thinking, \"there has got to be a reason why people hate me.\" The only thing I can think of to answer that thought, would be that I am totally myself. I don\\'t sugar coat shit. I\\'m honest and I like to share ideas and past expieriances. So here is a little description about me to paint a better picture. I try hard with things I do. I really enjoy practicing different skills and hobbies that strike my interest suddenly such as painting, playing instruments, gymnastics, yoga, hiking, biking, dog training, cooking, singing and more. If something interests me I try it. You could say I\\'m a go getter. At the same time I\\'m laid back, I\\'m quiet and a keep to myself person. Other times I am wacky and weird. I sing and dance to myself, I talk to myself. I do weird things. I make jokes and I laugh at things. I am over the spectrum of things. I am ever changing. I am confused but I am aware. I am always looking around me and thinking people are planning things. I avoid people. Other times I truely care about people. I love people and I love seeing their talents. I want to get to know them and I listen to them. I always see people and notice their intentions. You could say I am observant. But all of this I still enjoy being alone. I guess I live a balanced life. I\\'m also a Libra and my life seems to match up to those horoscopes most of the time to also paint a picture of myself. So instead of rambling on and on and on as I\\'m surprised if anyone is even still reading this, I\\'m going to get straight to the point. I\\'ve learned a lesson in life and it is difficult to grasp!! The lesson is, no one actually truely cared about me all along but myself. It was me all along that cared too much about what people thought. It was my reactions towards situations that hurt me and made me think people hate me. I have to come to terms that I am simply an imperfect human being with odd characteristics as everyone else! We are all so unique and in our own little worlds. We all work differently and that\\'s how we all fit together just as a puzzle and how each piece is unique and all work together. Sometimes it takes a while for the pieces to come together and sometimes they seem to fit but they don\\'t really work well and you can\\'t actually fit them perfectly. Sometimes different pieces in the puzzle need to be as far away as possibly to work perfect and help complete the picture. It is okay to not get along with everyone but when they show their dislike I need to keep calm and carry on. What I mean by our own little worlds is, everything around us is determined by our own judgements and the way we see things around us. We all see things differently, our brains work differently and you can clearly see we are all different so that proves our own little worlds. We all automatically look out for our own well being. So my whole life I was thinking too hard about what people thought of me. Once someone expressed their slight 2 second care about me, my reaction made me believe that everyone hated me. It was a delusion. I had a chain reaction because once I believed everyone hates me my actions and reactions more than likely changed that held characteristics that are easy to dislike by other people. Hopefully out of all of this rambling is that I can continue to realize these thoughts of mine and start to have a better attitude towards life. I hope I can bring light and new helpful ideas to the world. I strive to be the best I can for myself and others. I will react to others even when they do me wrong as a calm and collected individual. I will handle my fight instinct as a normal human in complete control. I will continue to just be myself and let others be themselves.\\')', 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with negative effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect', 'outdoor activity or space with positive effect'], 'scores': [0.40169623494148254, 0.31371569633483887, 0.28458812832832336]}\n",

Tuesday I left my house with the intent of going but about midway through I just started panicking and instead walked around the city so my family didn\\'t start suspecting of anything. I swear I never walked as much a I did that day it was pathetic, and all because I\\'m afraid to go to class. That was when I decided that I wouldn\\'t go at all that week and instead I\\'d prepare myself and today I\\'d be in a changed man an all the fear and anxiety would be gone. Late night Sunday the same disgusting feeling started going on again. Heart racing, this awful feeling on my stomach where you are completely comfortable on your couch yet it feels like something isn\\'t right... I go to YouTube and start watching the same guys again and again trying to get this awful feeling out of my body, trying to find some sort of miraculous solution for my problems. Today I wake up, leave my house to go to school but each stride makes me more and more anxious. I create all these movies inside my head \"How will they react, Will I be accepted What should I Say, Will they talk to me, What I they ask me a question....\" so, like last week, I just didn\\'t go again instead I\\'m typing this in the sort of park while listening to music. This same thing happened to me last year too, i spent about a week going to university and turning back last moment without entering the actual school room because I was afraid of what I\\'d find out The worst part is that I\\'m breaking the trust of my family who thinks I\\'m being an adult and being responsible. Im 25 years old, I\\'m \"studying\" in my city, what am I afraid of? I don\\'t get it I know that once I eventually break this cycle I\\'ll look back and think I had nothing to be scared of, like I said the same happened to me last year and after going things went pretty smoothly. I know taking action is the most difficult part and I get inside my own head way too much. I don\\'t know what I expect by making this post. I know it all comes down to me and me only at the end, there\\'s no Jordan Peterson, no Robbins, no random YouTube video that is going to help me, any exercise that will help me. I guess I hope to find someone to make myself accountable, or someone who went through the same or maybe I hope that by admitting to someone my situation I\\'ll see how stupid I\\'m being.

            "{'sequence': \"('I have no friends and I feel lonely. * Post is going to be long and thank you to anyone who actually reads all of it Okay so I’m 19F and I have no friends. In high school I had 2-3 really close friends including my main best friend lets call her BFF, and a bunch of other friends mainly just people I talked to and hung with in school and class but was never truly close with. So my bff and I were super close all of high school until about the end of march when she basically ditched me for a new group of friends she made. We would still talk and I was her “best friend” but once she started hanging out with her new friend group she never included me, stopped telling me about important thing going on in her life, etc and overall just acting really snobby and conceited. I ended up confessing to one of the other girls I was really close with what was happening, and she was by my side and supported me. My bff and I ended up talking everything through and were good but things didn’t really change. She kept hanging out with them at all times never including me and when I did hang with them (once) she barely spoke to me the entire time. After we graduated she had two weeks in our city before she had to go away and start summer semester at a college far away but still in the same state. She spent the whole two with her new friend group and only gave me one day to hang out 3 days before she had to leave. During this time I was at my dad’s house and was so pissed that she would do this to me that I was not going to leave my dads house just so she could see me when she had all this time to and didn’t. Summer goes along and we didn’t talk not even once. At this point in my life I had decided to start school in the spring to give myself some time because I felt that I needed it and my only two friends were the girl that helped me out with my bff and her best friend who was also my friend. The entire summer we barely hung out. After summer we hung out a couple times but they were all super boring. I’m personally very outgoing and a hyped up type of person when I’m around people I feel comfortable with. They would just sit there and not want to do anything fun or engaging. I don’t mean get drunk and party all night, but like go makeup shopping or play fun stupid games, go out to eat, talk about boys, go shopping, go to the beach, or in general anything besides like going to one of their houses and playing nintendo wii. Plus on top off all this they were very judgy and would look at me weird for saying something outside of the box. When I would ask one of them about the boys in the college I was going to go to in the spring she would be dry and uninterested. Then in October I got a job, and I really like the place I work at. When we would hang out and I would try to tell them about the people and like the tea going on at work they didn’t care and I would talk and they didn’t respond and I felt like I was talking to my self. All of this plus the fact that since they were each others best friend they wouldn’t include me in a lot of their convos and then bring up things when I was there made me feel really lonely and tired. Eventually was broke the camels back was that drama basically started again with my bff and when I texted them I was just going to text her and end this once and for all they both started sending messages like “oooohhh can’t wait for the tea” or “🐸☕️”, “the tea it hot” and in general things like that. I was so offended because instead of being there for me and supporting me bc they both knew how hurt and emotionally affected I was from the situation between my bff and I all they cared about was the tea and the drama. A month after this happened I cut them off but only talked to one of them. It was the one that helped me in the beginning with my bff. I thanked her for supporting and that I was always going to be grateful for that but that our friend ship was over and I explained to her how they made me feel and basically she texted me back cursing me out and saying a whole bunch of rude shit and I never texted her again. Both of them blocked me on all social media platforms and I have not seen, heard, or talked to them since that day. I started college but online bc I have no transportation to campus so I have no interactions with people my own age and at my job it’s mainly middle aged women and a few young people but not anyone I consider to have a good connection friendship wise with. It gets me so sad to see my ex bff on social media going to parties and having fun, making friends, etc. when I wish I was doing that. Plus just in general watching young people my age having fun and hanging out with their “squad” makes me depressed! Because I want that. Now because of my friendless life and because I have little to no interaction with people my own age in over a year I’m beyond scared to do school on campus so I’ve decided to do all of college online. I’ve definitely gotten a lot anxiety in regards to being social with people my own age and also boys. I’ve never had a boyfriend or even talked to anyone and with my whole lonely no friends no social life situation I’m never going to meet one and if I do, I mentally I’ve already sabotaged myself because I think to myself how embarrassing it would be to meet a boy and when he asks about my friend me tell him that I have none. Like how fucking embarrassing and lame does that sound. So to avoid this Im just not gonna let any potential guy get close enough. Plus I’m insecure about my body bc Im a little chubby but don’t do anything to change this because I have zero motivation. So far the only good things going for me are my job, school, and my immediate family. I get depressed when I think about the fact that I’m so young and I have no friends anyone to hangout with and have normal social interactions with. Like am I really going to waste all of my young years stuck in my house all day and working as much as possible. Sometimes I think that the best I can do is graduate and keep moving up in the company I work for now and become a workaholic and live with my parents until forever.

Should also add that he is a few steps above acquaintance level. There had been some quite heavily alcohol intake from everyone at this party and sometime during the night me and a friend decide to take a walk around the neighborhood and he decides to come with. I tell my friend about this feeling about him hating me (2nd time, have talked about it before and she says that's not the case). This situation ends up with me deciding it's a great time to tell him how I feel. My friend ends up telling him that I feel this way with my permission (He also doesn't know I have anxiety or any problems btw). He then comes over and of course tells me that's absolutely not the case. I suddenly break down crying and hyperventilating in his arms and we talk it out as best we can (we are alone at this stage). My friend then gets back and in my drunk state I pretty much word vomit out a confusing summary of my history with anxiety and my current state to them. We keep on walking the three of us and he keep comforting me with kind words, small hugs and back touches until we arrive back at the party with me now close to anxiety free. I'm now a little confused about this. I'm honestly glad I told him, it feels like it got rid a little bit of the whole thought about people hating me. I also feel guilty that I brought another person in to my anxiety. I sent him a message this morning apologising about that he had to see that and that I put him in this position, and he said everything was cool and I believe him. I honestly thought I would have more anxiety about this but a big part of me just laughs at this whole situation which is wierd. So this is just a little bit of a vent from a hungover girl.

Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been super shy. I don’t know why. Nothing happened to me as a child, I have a great family and have great friends so I don’t know why I have this debilitating issue. I looked it up, and i learned that sometimes people with an overactive amygdala have a heightened fight or Flight response therefore causing more severe anxiety. So maybe it’s a biological thing for me, but I have thought of anything at all that could have affected me to be like this but nothing comes to mind. Throughout middle school, I haven’t even realized but In seventh grade I was depressed. I don’t think I knew it. I knew I was sad but didn’t know if it went further than that. I don’t remember being suicidal then, but seventh grade was the first time I started to self harm. I was always getting in trouble with my parents, I’ve always felt like they’re out to get me and I never show or receive any affection. Because of this, me and my parents relationships is not the best. and I know it’s my fault. They try to understand why I act certain ways but I don’t even know myself. I wish I had an answer. So anyway, an incident happened in seventh grade where I had to share something with the class. Presentations always scared me and being in front of the class always did. Even if it was a simple yes or no question. I can’t stand being the center of attention and I always cry when I feel this social anxiety coming on. We had to share poems we had written and I just remember being so scared, I just started crying and couldn’t get through it. I remember my classmates faces and they were so confused and I was confused to. I knew it was just a presentation but my body had another idea. To this day I’m not sure if that was my first anxiety attack? and I’m not sure if I’ve ever had an anxiety attack because I never feel like the world is ending I just get so embarrassed I think, that all I can do is cry and my heart starts beating rapidly, and I’m shaking and I just wanna disappear. But do people have anxiety attacks differently? If you know, please help. Anyway, after that happened I was SO mortified I didn’t even want to go back to school. I always assumed people labeled me as the super shy freak girl and wouldn’t want to talk to me anyway so I decided to do virtual school in eighth grade. No one knows that’s the reason I decided to be homeschooled. I just tell everyone “I don’t know just felt like it” when they ask because I don’t want to tell them my embarrassing story. So virtual school actually turned out to be awful and so I ended up starting high school for 9th grade as a freshman. Because I skipped out on 8th grade, I already didn’t have many friends. And the ones I did have, lets call her Lauren. She was my absolute best friend and we ended up having a class together so that was the class I looked forward to. I remember always being isolated in my other classes while everyone else talked and I would be so scared around people and scared that someone would talk to me. I didn’t have many friends that year. I also repeatedly cut and I was developing an addiction. Come sophomore year, I was deeply depressed. My best friend, still Lauren, she glew up. She became popular and gorgeous and it was hard being friends with her sometimes because she had so many friends and guys all over her. I know it wasn’t her fault of course, and through it all she stuck by me and I couldn’t be more grateful to have someone like her to this day. But I can’t Help but feel inferior when I’m with her sometimes. I would always think “people are probably wondering why she’s friends with you” “they just think you’re a charity case” I was so quiet all the time. I honestly don’t remember much of sophomore year. I just remember being sad all the time. I remember drawing sad sketches. I discovered and became obsessed with twenty One pilots, (still my favorite band today and I’m seeing them this year FLOOR TICKETS! can’t wait haha.) so come junior year, I told myself if I wasn’t happier by the end of the year I would kill myself before senior year. I met my other best friend junior year and we are so similar it’s crazy. So greatful for her friendship. Still struggled with self harm. I started to maybe get a little better, or so I thought I was. I got my first job at Burger King, which was not the wisest decision. Smoked weed and got high for the first time. Developed a huge crush on a boy who did nothing but lead me on. It really wrecked me and I don’t think he has any idea of how much to this day. Pierced my nose. I think I kept trying new experiences to feel something, convince myself to stay. I thought it was working but deep down, I was the same. Didn’t self harm as much because it wasn’t as easy to hide anymore. And my mom found out a little later and everything just got a bit crazy. Forced into therapy and parents found a pipe and new I was smoking. They were absolutely furious. I also was caught with a boy over at like 2 am by my mom. Not my finest moment. I think this was definitely my most impulsive year. I started to do things that scared me and that I knew was wrong but I think I was just trying to fill the void I had. One night I decided I had enough and tried to overdose on vistaril. I remember feeling the effects of it and becoming super tired so I thought that was it. I went to bed peacefully. Well, spoiler, I woke up. I was so mad I hadn’t taken enough but I think I was also relieved. I read about liver damage and all that and I decided that if I was going to do it again, I would take enough so I wouldn’t end up in the hospital impaired all my life. So summer before senior year, my best friend, Lauren, invited me to a church camp. I’ve always been a Christian and such but never had a relationship with God. That camp was a turning point for me. I met so many people and developed so many friendships and it opened my eyes to a life I wanted to live. And for the first time, I felt like I had support. People who were there for me and like I had God. But my depression still didn’t go away. I was still sad. So so sad. One of the hardest things I’ve ever done, is opened up and told my feelings of depression and suicidal ideation to. One night at the camp, it was the last night and we were all in this big room sharing stories or just venting things we needed to get off of our chest. Telling people things we needed prayer for. I told everyone In that room, maybe 60 people, my plans of killing myself. How I was going to before senior year but that this camp changed my mind. And I could barely get through it without crying. After that, a lot of people came to hug me and tell me to stay strong and that they were there for me. It was an amazing and cool experience. But I started attending church with her and becoming stronger in my faith and I connecting with amazing people. I went to Guatemala in 2017 on a mission trip and it was an amazing experience. Everything was as good as could be. I just wanted to be done with High school and done with my past there. I was ready for college and what life had for me. I can’t believe it, but I was dare I say hopeful. I felt guilty for being anxious and depressed as a Christian though. It of course, was no where as near as bad as it was but I still woke up and felt that same emotionless i felt for so long and tiredness. Soon enough, I just accepted it. People think that because I have Jesus now that I’m okay. But inside I am still hurting and depressed. I think about suicide almost everyday but I would never act on it. I know God is there for me and would never want me to do this, his plans are always greater. And I believe that, I do. I went to Montreal on a mission trip this past November and it was awesome. I love helping people and showing gods love and although it’s hard to connect with people sometimes due to social anxiety, i know I’ll get through it. But still depression lingers. I worked at chick fil a for a bit but quit due to anxiety and the amount of people there and all. I try daily to get back up. I need a job but I’m scared to get one just to become over whelmed and quit again. I keep letting people down. I still want to die. I wish I could just go peacefully. I feel like a ghost among the living and I’ve always felt like something Is wrong with me. I’m on meds and I always dream of overdosing but I could never. I have a tattoo dedicated basically saying “this may suck but God’s still got you”. It’s “And if not, he is still good”. I got that tattoo and wrote my testimony about having social anxiety and living through it. I feel like a hypocrite for feeling like I want to die still. I always encourage others and tell them that it does get better and to hold on and I hope they believe me when I say it and can’t see behind my mask. I think I believe it when I say it to them. But for some reason my mind makes me believe that I will never succeed and I’m bound to live a purposeless life. Everyday I wake up and I say just another day to exist. Just doing my classes and occasionally meeting up with friends. I feel like I’m lying to them. No one knows how I feel am I’m ashamed to tell them. I don’t want them to take pity on me and I don’t want to treated like I’m going to break if they touch me. I am in a new relationship. My first boyfriend, and he is the sweetest most amazing thing. But I’m scared to tell him how I feel. I warned him of my depression and anxiety but I didn’t tell him the extent of it. He doesn’t know I self harm. Which I did for the first time in about 6 months yesterday. He saw and I told him it was the cat. Lame excuse and I don’t think he bought it. I’m torn between scared of telling him and him not wanting to deal with this or just tell him because he was going to leave anyway. either way I lose. it’s best to be honest right? Anyway.

            "{'sequence': \"('My story. Includes social anxiety, body dysmorphia and incel. English is not my native language, so u can read some weird words. I will try to ´´summarize´´ this (at the bottom, there is a real summary). As a child, when i was around 11, i was really attractive to everyone. I know this because at school, i got all the girls chasing me, and so outside. Obviously, i was too young to ´´benefit´´ on this. At that age, i remember myself as an outgoing kid, that had friends and did some regular stuff. Later on, something happened. I think that the inflection point was the haircut that i started wearing, the classic mushroom haircut that a lot of kids wear...with the difference that i was a teenager already. From being a young Adonis, i started to hear the mock of some girls, through the nicknames that they put on me, refered to my haircut. All my friends started having some interactions with girls, while i was just staring, too afraid of rejection. That was the beginning of my fearful existence, and it continued (with ups and downs) until my current age of 25. So yeah, right now i feel like i didnt live at all. I never had a girlfriend, i only have 1 friend that i meet every few months, i never had a job and never been to a party. This decade has been a mix of playing World of Warcraft, doing sport (cycling and calisthenics, obv individual sports), and studying some random useless shit that my mother suggested me to. I feel like it doesnt matter what i study, since there is people in almost every single profession. Ive studied hostelry and quitted it cos its too customer-facing. Ive studied sport and physical activity animator...but it was only because i like to practice it, im too insecure for teaching or doing anything in fron of a group. Now i switched to programming...but seems that im too autistic even for the nerd-world, since the teacher already told me that i have to learn to participate more while working in a groupal project...but i just end up excluding myself. Sport is what saved me through all this time. When im at home, i cant stop thinking about the past and the future, and i listen a lot of depressing music. So i need to take a ride on my bike almost every day. Im prety good at it and its hard to think about random shit when you are under big physical effort. I consider myself a good interlocutor, but i only can show this in individual conversations. In a group (specially if i dont know the members), im unable to articulate a single word unless someone ask my oponion directly. This is hard for me, because everybody that ever meet me, told me that im a very witty person and i can contribute to the conversation. Im really quick at making word games. Somebody once told me that i should try rap battles. And i would...if i could articulate a fucking word in front of groups of strangers -.-º. Because of this witty personality, i know that people want me in their groups, and i got invited to random plans and parties many times...but always refused. I just cant stop thinking about little details that throw me back: what if i have to dance, what if they wanna take photos, what if my clothes are not suitable...And so, for me, saturday is just another weekday to play WoW and do some sport... I once challenged myselft to go to a psychologist. Since the first session was free and it was one to one conversation, i thought i had no excuse. It went pretty well, she got really interested in me, because we talked for an hour and a half (the session had one hour) and she even invited me to come for another free session and to pay whatever amount i could for the next ones. Not to vary, i rejected... As to relationships, ive always been on this dating webs, but it has been useless because my profile photos sucks. I hate being photographed, i dont want to recognize myself on the pics(i think im much better in person) .I always have the same 3 pics from a specific angle and blurry. I consider myself pretty good at flirting, but if the profile pic is not attractive, u wont get the chance to start a conversation. And so, i didnt meet a single girl this way. Well...i actually met one. It was on a social anxiety forum. We exchanged numbers. I could see her picture, but she couldnt see mine, so everything was ok xD. She was really pretty, which surprised me(even more, when i discovered that she had like 1k followers on IG). We chatted for a week straight, it was amazing. One day, she asked me to meet in real life, which is really hard for me, but after those conversations, i thought there was feeling between us, so i accepted. We met in a bar. She was really beautiful irl, but not as perfect as in those IG pics, which i liked even more. At first, we were kinda nervous, but the beer made its effect and we talked for hours.It was getting late and she suggested me to pass the night in my house. Im naive, but i think i know what this kind of proposition means...Still it was a terrible idea, cos i live with my mom. Dont know how and why, i ended up accepting. Before arriving to my house, i thorowed up(cos i smoked, and that makes me sick most of the times). Once in my house, my mom woke up...Well, we ended up sleeping on the same bed, but nothing could have happened cos i was too wasted X_X. Surprisingly, she wanted to keep meeting with me, and we met one more time, a few months later. The most remarkable about this one, is that we kissed. It was a really quick and cold experience, so i dont even consider it as i ever kissed. The fact that she kissed me (obv it was she who went for it) without passion, meant a lot for me. The next day, i told her to break up, because i was getting feelings, and she told me that she only was looking for friendship. She insisted in meeting again, but i rejected. That was the last time i had something with a girl, two years ago. And this is how i learned that u cant have social anxiety and 1k followers on IG by posting pics of your body. Ive cried a lot after that break up, and now im again on that numb state that everything is bad, but not enough to cry... How do i know that i have body dysmorphia. Simple: because im the supreme textrovert. I feel very secure when it comes to written comunication (more on my native language). I consider myself good at flirting (i know how to tease) and i use to troll a lot (even whole groups of people), specially the people that cry about their situation or blame others. Everything is ok as long as they dont see a picture of me. One really strange thing is that, in videogames, i never been able to speak through a microphone, which is a requirement for doing a lot of fun stuff. So i ended up being a loner even in videogames. Add that to my completism (im obsessed with achieving everything that is achievable in the games (and irl too)). Overall, i think i have a really great body, specially because i practiced several sports for more than ten years, Im 1.85 height, 70kg with very lean muscles and long legs. My hair is of an amazing quality and my haircut now is an upgraded version of the mushroom style that i think began everything xD. It makes me look younger. I dont like a lot of things about my face, but i think it has some personality. And down there, im slightly over the average. On the other hand, lets talk about what i dont like and what keeps me locked in this mental prison. I dont like my short arms, it makes me feel inferior in some sports (i feel like i have to be the best in everything). I actually started thinking that people with short arms are doomed, or something like that :/. I dont like my nose and how it looks when i smile (thats why i never smile in photos) I dont like how my hair looks when its wet, and the fordyce spots on my lips. I got the fordyce spots down there, too. They are harmless small white sebaceous bumps under the skin. Despite being well endowed, i focus more on the spots and the form of my D, which i dont like neither. Ive been watching porn for more than ten years, and it changes yourself physically and mentally. I cant stop comparing myself to the men that appear on the videos. I know almost everything about my conditions and my ´´flaws´´, because ive been reading shit about them for too long. The conclusion is that there is no magical solution, u just have to accept yourself. I read a lot about spirituality, too. Thats why i know that my goal in this life is to trascend this extreme identification with the body. To kill the ego, to live in the moment...but God, its been more than ten years and i didnt perceive much progress...I even know the techniques (meditation, self love affirmations, etc), but i end up thinking about the bad things. I still have hope, tho, and dont even contemplate suicide, because i would have to learn the lesson on the next life. Jesus, its tooking me the whole weekend to write this...with huge breaks, of course. Im such a perfectionist that i have to think a lot before before writing a line, then rewrite it...and i dont even like the final result. If you made it here: congratulations, you really deserve a prize xD! Here is the summary of this bible. I feel that i have a lot of amazing attributes, Physically im very fit because ive been practicing differen sports for more than ten years. Ive got a strong personality and witty sense of humor, as people say. Im good at flirting, too. But i just can show it. I isolate myself every time, reject invitations to social plans and let go a lot of chaces. I do this because im terrified of other peoples judgements, specially towards my body (in the supreme textrovert). Im very insecure sexually because of the classic fordyce spot issue. Now the real questions. Does anyone identify to this? Did anyone overcome a similar situation or have any advices? Do anyone wanna share his story?

Speaking of college, I have a bachelors degree in English (I know) I am currently unemployed and my last two jobs were in non profit academic advisory roles. I was pretty much a loner and hated school throughout life. I was taken to a therapist when i was 12, and they declared I was \"normal.\" I started questioning life in college and realized it was pretty useless and that it was school and work until you die. I drank liquor i would say the normal amount for a college student. After graduating, I took the two advisory jobs which I hated both jobs due to anxiety. I am not a people person in general and I would sweat profusely when talking to students or even in mildy hot temperatures. I sweat 10x more than others even in the winter. I would sweat in a crowded subway or platform or talking to new people. I spoke to a doctor and I was prescribed robinul and told I had hyperhydrosis. The robinul works so that part of my life is solved temporarily. In addition to this, no matter what allergy medicine I take or what dose, I drip water from my nose and eyes. If I go outside especially in the morning, and its sunny or windy, my eyes water. I get acid reflux and heartburn from tomato sauce, coffee and liquor (all things I love). I also find myself getting extremely angry at the simplest things (people walking slow in the city, etc, to the point where I think about attacking someone in my head.) When I began feeling suicidal at my first job after graduation, I spoke to a therapist again who once again told me I was \"normal\" a \"regular new yorker\". At this point I am at a wits end and speak to another doctor who prescribes me zoloft and other downers. I mix them with alcohol in a excessive amounts to cope with the job I hate. I stop taking the zoloft pretty because they didn\\'t work for me. I was taking to a hospital where people told me i was a handsome man who had things to live for and sat next to a girl with 16 cut marks on her arm and a guy who wanted to start fires with his hands. I did my research before hand and I realized that they would probably give me shock therapy (I don\\'t know how that would help) so I pretended to feel better. Fast forward to today, I am unemployed living off my parent. I work out about three or four times a week, I am about 5\\'11 195. The only problem is I have little to no appetite daily and I am starting to develop a belly. I eat maybe twice a day (where i force myself to eat),I sweat like Patrick Ewing in the fourth quarter if I don\\'t take robinul and i work out 4 times a week So this is unexplainable to me Anyway, I\\'ve had ultrasounds, endoscopy, colonscopy and the gastro doctor stated I was in perfect health and the only theory he has is ibs. As you can see, I\\'ve had a long series of issues in my body and doctors telling me everything is fine and blah blah etc. So I\\'m at a wit\\'s end.

I could have easily put my laptop in my bag and went home – but I didn’t. Not only am I able to focus more and get work done but I am also moving forward in my social goal (no matter how small). I used to wonder if people were judging me and watching me for just taking my laptop out of my bag or my revision notes (even though everyone in the room was doing it). **And, this is a big one**. For the first time, I left my laptop and notepad in the library whilst I took a break outside for fresh air. People didn’t steal my shit! **People aren’t as scary or untrustworthy as I have often thought.** These are the first steps I made for myself and after a while I will start getting out my comfort zone and be more social. Although I am not really talking to strangers yet, I still feel I am making progress. Next up, I will be attending some workshops to try and meet people. And overtime throughout this year, I will start learning to small talk with strangers; smiling more to strangers; making phone calls; volunteering; initiating conversations rather than standing alone; asking a girl (multiple girls) out so I can finally get started as a late bloomer in this dating world; and I might even travel on my own. **Small steps matter.**')\", 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with positive effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect', 'outdoor activity or space with negative effect'], 'scores': [0.7998760342597961, 0.11151787638664246, 0.08860613405704498]}\n",
            "{'sequence': \"('My ultimate guide for defeating social anxiety. Hello, I’m a 16 yo male and this is (and probably will be) my only post on this Subreddit. Recently I discovered something great, and I want you to read this post because you’re probably struggling with social anxiety dominating your life like it used to do mine. Remember that „you were born into“ a society. You were raised with patterns to follow. You are scared of breaking these patterns. Scared of breaking out of society. Scared of being rejected by it. Now I want you to differentiate between SOCIETY and HUMANITY. Society is a theoretical construct. A mindset. Society is what has these rules that make you scared of being yourself(„don‘t dress differently“, „don‘t run outside when others see you“ for example.). Humanity are people. Humanity are the people around you and the people you meet. The construct of society and these rules shall not apply for now. In my school bus is always this guy. He enters as one of the last. He‘s probably as old as me. He wears plain black clothes and tries to avoid any eye contact at all. His eyes are dead. When he sits on his seat he doesn‘t even put off his bag from his back. He doesn‘t want to make noise and come off as annoying, even though the bag taking all his space clearly makes him uncomfortable and it bothers him. This guy is affected by society. Not just affected, it‘s dominating all of his actions. Of course noone would give a f*ck if he would just put off his bag, but he still has his made-up rules carved into his mind. This applied to me aswell. Perhaps you may have seen by now that society cares, but humanity clearly doesn’t. Now at one point in the last few days I found a point: „What if I disconnected from all of this?“, „What if I didn‘t care?“. Whenever I am in an anixious situation now, for example walking past a row of cars, I tell myself: „These rules don‘t apply for me now. I‘m free now.“ I‘d like to show you another example. When someone mocks you for being an idiot(let‘s say you just stumbled and fell) and you care about it, you may feel like an idiot. Even worse, you let the bully take control over your emotions. You let him take your soul. Now what if you simply wouldn‘t care? He‘s the idiot now, He keeps mocking about you. But he keeps mocking a god. You are way out of his league now. You don’t care about his existence and his words. Instead of actually feeling like an idiot and feeling he deserves the right to mock you because society says that, he‘s just being a rude child now and you don‘t have to worry about him at all. He‘s still trapped in his little society cage, and you‘re a free and respectable human now. Perhaps maybe you may still think that ignoring society patterns may make you an outsider, and make you end up as a lonely old man/woman without having ever been loved. Think of the most confident man/woman you know. Think of someone harassing him/her. The confident person would never even let the harasser close to affecting its emotions. It doesn‘t have any emotional investment at all in the people around it because society doesn‘t have it caught in its chains. Perhaps maybe the average society-affected person will not like you now, but it will respect you. On the other hand, humanity will not only respect, but love you. Once you disconnect from society you will start to attract many great new people. And it‘s way better than being in the society hole where you have to show heavy commitment everyday in order to not be rejected. I want you to disconnect from society now. Break the patterns, break the barrier. Be comfortable and confident with yourself. This movement doesn‘t take any realistic commitment, I just needs a change in your mind. When you feel anxiety in your actions, don’t care. I don’t want you to demonstrate that you don’t care, I want you to not care. There’s a big difference between showing and doing. You can still be a respectable person and respect other people while not giving a sh*t about the rules of society. I hope I have helped you with this. Keep going. P.S. Since this is my only post here I‘d like to recommend you 2 great books which really helped me on my journey: - „Models“ by Mark Manson (I originally bought this book to be more attractive to women but the book guides you through a internal development too. I highly recommend this book to women aswell) -„Can‘t hurt me“ by David Goggins (This book changed my life)')\", 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with positive effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect', 'outdoor activity or space with negative effect'], 'scores': [0.4586063027381897, 0.3042720556259155, 0.23712165653705597]}\n",

Hi everyone, this may be a bit long, but I appreciate anyone who reads even most of this!  and#x200B; Anyway, I\\'m a 24 M living in a big city. And a social anxiety sufferer. My social anxiety isn\\'t physically crippling or physiological -- my physical symptoms are usually pretty limited -- but it\\'s mental and I am an expert in avoidance. I would even say I am a \\\\*very\\\\* social and outgoing person in \"comfortable\" environments (alcohol, bars, sporting events, with friends or people I trust, etc.), but when it comes to \"uncomfortable\" environments including putting myself out there and being alone doing it, I avoid them (joining clubs/sports teams, going to events, meeting new people, talking to people at bars, etc.) altogether.  and#x200B; My social anxiety stems from insecurity and a lack of self-confidence. I wasn\\'t beat up or anything as a kid, but I grew up being bullied, condescended toward, and made fun of for my lack of height at the time -- I was one of the shortest kids in school (I\\'m 5\\'8 now and have not been insecure about this in years) -- and for being skinny and small in general as a man in a society that often sees men like that as weak and a joke. Teachers told me I couldn\\'t audition for roles because of my height, kids my age made fun of me, and adults made snide comments. All of this contributed toward deeply ingraining into my head a fundamental insecurity. I wore sweatshirts during the summer and shirts at the beach because I had terrible body image issues. From the age of like 10. **Long story short, from an early age I was very insecure, had major body image issues, and terrible self-confidence and this contributed greatly to creating my social anxiety.**  and#x200B; **Fast forward to today.** I am still skinny and small and find that the women who are into me tend to be 2-3 years younger usually because I \\\\*do\\\\* look young and small for my age. Dating can be frustrating. But, I am going to the gym, I\\'m starting to feel more confident in my body, and I know that I have had a good amount of romantic opportunities, even if it has never worked out into a relationship. I feel good about myself, have become extremely self-aware of my own insecurities and how I projected them in the past, and in general I am content. But, I still cannot get over the avoidance of social anxiety. It\\'s ingrained into my head.  and#x200B; **It has prevented me from making more friends** in a new city -- the idea of doing a Meetup or joining a club is terrifying to me. And I just avoid doing that kind of thing altogether. **It has prevented me from, say, talking to women at a bar,** \\\\*even in\\\\* a drunken state when I feel good about myself. It just takes over and I tell myself I\\'m not attractive, that I\\'m going to embarrass myself, etc. It has essentially reduced my chances of meeting women to only on dating apps. **And it also has held me back in my career and what I want to do in life**. I\\'m a deeply political person but I can\\'t network. I can\\'t bring myself to go to happy hour\\'s by myself or join political clubs or anything. I simply cannot put myself out there alone into unfamiliar situations. The thought of being awkward or having no one to talk to or being seen as ridiculous or an idiot -- these things fill my head and so avoid these situations altogether.  and#x200B; I don\\'t want to look back five years from now and not have made more friends, not have taken a risk romantically by talking to someone I didn\\'t know, and not have truly tried to pursue my political dreams. I have gone to therapy lately but the appointments are few and far in-between (once a month at best) and while it has helped me become even more self-aware, it has not helped me with, well, changing my brain chemistry. And I don\\'t want to be resigned to thinking this is just how I am going to be. I am missing out on so many opportunities from friends to partners to career/hobbies. **Above all, I am frustrated that I have all the logical solutions to this problem (Who actually cares what people think of you?), but that does nothing for what feels like an innate reaction to unfamiliar situations**. **I can be confident one moment and then crumble the next. I get rejected in some form and it just feeds into a spiral.** **This is very long and I am rambling, but thought I would find friendly ears here.

It feels like most communities I have tried to be a part of have features around them that made me distance myself from being a part of that community. I understand that I am the problem in this situation and I'm probably overgeneralizing everything. Here are some examples: I enjoy casual gaming, but not enough to care about gaming news or events. I feel like a huge amount of people in the gaming community my age are overly edgy, rage a lot over games or are neckbeardy which scares me off. I also hate playing video games for hours on end, I get burnt out really easily and gamers usually like to have long sessions with each other. I drifted away from my gaming friends because the burnout from playing video games for hours at a time was too much for me. I enjoy hip hop and r andb, but a lot of the culture around this for my age is associated with people who smoke weed, drink, and go clubbing, which intimidates me as I don't like the loss of control associated with drugs and loud 'carefree' environments like clubs. I also feel like there's huge pressure to be on social media within this community. In high school I was friends with people who were into this community a lot and as they got older we drifted apart as they became clubbers and big on alcohol etc. I enjoy football, but I hate the competitiveness that comes with playing it (even socially, you'll get shouted at or made fun of for mistakes) and there is a hyper masculine/ drinking community stereotype associated with casual footballers my age. I also am terrible at football! I have always dabbled in and out of this community but as I was never very good, I didn't really get any respect, and I found playing a very high pressure scenario. All the above seem like immaturity problems, but there are other communities Ive tried to get into that I didn't have this problem with but I just didn't enjoy being a part of them. For example I have tried an art community, but I am not very good at art which made me embarassed whenever I went to the classes, and the way I think I naturally struggled to make and critique art. I also just felt very uncomfortable in this environment, which I think may be due to the fact that I'm not very passionate about art. I'm happy I at least tried though. I have tried a board game community, but I found it too nerdy for me, and I just didn't find any of the board games we played fun. I just didn't feel engaged enough and as passionate as the others were about the games, and the people in the group were all a lot older than me. I'm constantly looking for communities I can join which I will feel comfortable with. I am thinking maybe a running community. However I am worried that this problem is going to follow me everywhere since I seem to perfectionistic about who I be friends with. Like I already know I don't care about run times and stuff so I may feel out of place being surrounded by people who do care.

My mind is empty... people talk for hours i cant even talk for a few secs. Idk how to start convos maybe its just online chat that sucks the blood out of me. I cant even do a small talk. Idk how to ask questions about peoples interests... they tell what they are interested in it and i just say \"cool\" or thats interesting.. my convos are so dumb and dull and boring.. i cant attract beautiful intelligent women either.

Some role model? Like who? James bond? What are convos suppose to be like? In real life and online?? I try really hard to make people laugh. It happens when i see someone being funny.. so i try to say something funny too. It turns out bad... I have spent so much of my life trying to be noticed/valued/heard.. and trying to get people to give me attention.. there is so much anger inside my towards my self and everything around me..

            "{'sequence': '(\\'[LONG/VENT] My first 2 therapy sessions made me feel worse. What should I do?. 25 year old male, living with my mom alone. I\\'ve never worked in my life. Never been in a relationship. Haven\\'t had a friend IRL in 10 years, which is also the amount of time that I\\'ve avoided going outside entirely unless absolutely necessary (a handful of times.). Never really been diagnosed with anything, but I have really bad social anxiety for sure. Deep depression and personality issues, adhd, possibly autistic spectrum. Who knows. I\\'ve avoided going to therapy/doctors for my entire life due to my anxiety and negative thoughts. I would talk with people online and I would always say that I would never go to a therapist, and thought it would never help me. This was based on brief interactions that I\\'ve had with therapists online, and me looking up stuff about therapists on the internet. Recently, other physical health issues of mine got so bad that I had to go to the ER, which lead me to going to a general doctor, which lead me to finally try to find a therapist. Problem is, I\\'m poor. I only have free insurance from the government, and there\\'s only a handful of therapists in my area that take it. I looked at their profiles. A lot of them honestly made me upset and uncomfortable, so I tried calling the ones that I thought I might get along with. Every. Single. One. said they weren\\'t accepting new clients. Which lead me to my only other option, going to a \"health center\" or something like that, dunno what it\\'s called, but it\\'s the place where courts send people who have drug addictions and stuff. I didn\\'t really have an option and they basically just automatically assigned me a therapist. I felt very uncomfortable with the idea of it. I don\\'t get along with people very well in general. I have a very low tolerance, but I\\'m so horrified of expressing my negative and rude thoughts out of fear for rejection. I really wanted to be able to choose someone that I thought would fit me well, but I still forced myself to give it a try anyways. I had this picture in my mind of how it would play out. I would come in, sit down. He would ask me questions and try to figure me out, understand my issues. I would try to open up, but mostly fail because I\\'m so anxious and I\\'m really bad at expressing myself. He would give hid input, professional advice, or \"help\", that would just upset and trigger me because I feel like it\\'s just generalized advice for \"normal\" people that\\'s not addressing the root cause of my issues. I would reject the help, repeatedly, until the therapist got sick of my rejection that they got rid of me and sent me to someone else. The fear of being rejected like that is so great that... It just makes it so hard to express my real thoughts and what I think. Anyways, what actually happened when I went to therapy... I guess it was what I expected and also not what I expected... what I expected was to be asked more questions, like he would make attempts at trying to figure me out or understand me, and that didn\\'t happen very much. I tried talking about some of my issues anyways, and he said a lot of things that really upset me deeply, but I didn\\'t feel comfortable expressing out of fear of upsetting him/him rejecting me. There was a lot of \"Learn to love yourself\"/accept yourself/accept negative beliefs/be mindful/cbt kind of comments and ideas that he said. I don\\'t know. I don\\'t really feel it addressed my issues very well. I really didn\\'t want to go the second time, despite the first one making me feel worse. I hoped that after going to the first session, that I would have just a tiny bit of relief, and a tiny bit of hope that MAYBE I could improve and work towards getting better, but it left me feeling more hopeless. I didn\\'t want to go the second time, but it was more of the same basically. It\\'s really hard for me to recall most of the things he said as I have a really bad memory, but most of it upset me and I suppressed my triggered feelings of anger and upset, again out of fear of being rejected and referred away. He talked about quicksand in analogy to struggles, and about how the more you fight against it, the more you sink, and you just need to calm down and just accept the issues and just let them be there. My mind screamed at me, NO!!!!!! I need help with my issues. I can\\'t just accept this. I can\\'t accept how of a miserable spot I\\'m in right now. I\\'m so fucking hopeless. I want to improve, not just sit around accepting and sitting in my misery. He talked about how he believes that everyone is fundamentally \"good enough\" and \"Okay\", which at my core I deeply disagree with. I definitely don\\'t feel good enough, and have so many areas that I need to improve upon, and need help with improving on. I feel like he did more talking than I did as well, and that he didn\\'t really want to seem to ask much questions or try to figure me out... is that normal? I want my issues to be addressed and I don\\'t feel like they are being addressed. And I don\\'t know if it\\'s just my anxiety, but the interactions with him were so awkward and unbearable, but that\\'s just how I am in social situations in general, all social interactions feel awkward and unbearable to me so I don\\'t know if that was him or me. I scheduled a third appointment coming up this Friday, in hope that maybe it will somehow turn around and change, and start slowly helping me instead of making me feel worse and more hopeless when I go. I don\\'t really feel have any options. I\\'m so absolutely stuck in life right now. I\\'m so hopeless and I don\\'t know what to do. I feel like I need help, but so far I don\\'t feel like this is helping, and I don\\'t fee like it could help, and I don\\'t know what could possibly help me. All I know is that this isn\\'t so far and I don\\'t know what to do. I don\\'t know how therapy is supposed to go in the first place, or what to look out for, or what to expect from it, but I should feel like I\\'m getting SOME kind of benefit out of it, right? Is it normal to feel this negative towards it at first? I know how unstable and negative I can be... maybe it\\'s just me getting in my own head, but maybe therapy isn\\'t right for me and maybe I should jump ship? I just don\\'t know what to do.

I always just default to saying \"good how are you\", and she ended up saying \"i\\'m doing really good\" and honestly just seemed super excited but the conversation kind of just ended since I didn\\'t know what else to say and she was like awkwardly walking backwards back to her desk while tripping and regaining balance on her foot lol.

I’ve never spoken out about my problems, and I’m not sure why I’ve come to reddit of all places but I’m just really hoping someone will listen to me and maybe understand... Basically my entire life has been revolved around making my mother happy, or her dictating what I can and can’t do. She always emailed my teachers when I was in elementary, middle, and even high school. She didn’t believe I could say what I needed to say or get the help if I didn’t understand something. She had an app that would show her my grades, and anytime I’d get a bad grade I knew that she was going to scold me. Now I fear that I will fail, and I do not know how to cope with failure at all. Whenever I’ve had boyfriends in the past she has always hovered over us 24/7. At 18 I decided to go to the movies with my best friend (he happens to be a guy but our relationship is strictly platonic). In the middle of the movie she turns on the find my iphone alert. Everyone in the theater turns to me because the alert sound is so loud. I have to run outside because I’m so embarrassed. I answer the phone and she’s yelling at me because apparently the map showed that I wasn’t where I told her I was (so she was spying on my location..). We argued and she made up some dumb excuse for why she embarrassed me.. saying the weather was bad and that she was concerned, but that it was my fault because I left when I knew the weather would be bad. I’m 19 now. She has access to all my emails (except one that I use for reddit) and social media. I now have social anxiety to the point where my mom has to do everything for me. Anytime our opinions don’t match or I give her “tough love” she tells me she feels betrayed by me. When I order food at restaurants I either let her order for me or I look to her for approval to go ahead and order. It is not even on purpose, it is just habit. When I’m at the doctors office I will explain my issues the best that I can, but she always has to add something because my explanation wasn’t good enough. When I get bad grades, I have a panic attack. I ask myself “what will mom do when she finds out?” I’ve never had a job because I’m too scared to work. My mom is obsessed with my weight. I am 130 pounds and 5 foot exactly. I’m a little on the thicker side but I’m not fat. There have been times when shes grabbed the fat on my arms, my least favorite body part, and said I don’t want my arms to look like “chicken legs” or something like that. I actually don’t normally hate my body, but every time she points something out I start noticing and hating it. Recently I went on antidepressants for my social anxiety. It’s only been about a week on them so I don’t expect much difference and there hasnt been yet. I know SSRI’s can take a while to work. I have eaten pretty normally, but my mom is obsessed with weight gain. I know they can make you gain weight, but its like thats all she talks about. These meds make you really tired so i havent been motivated, but she is forcing me to walk in the heat with her. Ive been telling her how tired they make me, but its like she doesnt understand. So I walked with her and afterwards felt so nauseous that i thought i was going to throw up (and i already have once). I don’t have anymore friends. I haven’t drove my car once this entire summer, and I hardly leave the house. Somedays I feel like a miserable excuse for a person, and this has made me think suicidal thoughts. The other day my mom actually told me that I don’t have depression because its not as bad as someone else she knows. No, maybe I don’t have “depression” but that doesn’t mean I don’t contemplate death. Before I started this medication I thought about death every single day and never told anyone. I love my mom, but this is the result of helicopter parenting. Now, I can’t even order food for myself or call the doctors office to set up an appointment. I would never want my child to go through what I now go through on a day to day basis. I feel like I’ve regressed back to infancy, always looking to my mom for approval. Raising my hand in class is an improvement for me. And that is just sad. At the same time my mom is nagging me to join clubs and make friends and I’m still trying to figure out how to raise my damn hand in class without having a panic attack. But no improvement is ever good enough. If I told her I raised my hand in class for the first time in 6 months she’d tell me that I need to force myself to join a club instead. Then I’m called too sensitive because I regress back into my shell after her statement. And apparently, we don’t believe in congratulating someone for little things like raising their hand because thats nothing. I am going to have to see my school counselor once the semester starts. I cannot keep living like this. This isn’t a reality to me. There is no way this is what my life has become. I have so much to say, and so many dreams of my own. I want to be successful.

I guess it is going to be dramatic for me... i’ve been dealing with it for at least 7 years now. 7 years of social anxiety that has gotten worse and worse over time.

(I’ve only had sex a few times) I’m also scared they will judge me for my living situation (more on that below). * I live with my parents still, since my line of work is hard to break into (Writing).

I added her on Facebook after that school trip and she messaged me the next day, saying that she had seen me leaving school but I was already too far away. We chatted for a slight bit and then she said her class had ended she was leaving school. I just said \"ok, talk to you later\" or something along the lines. In reality she wanted me to tell her to meet up, considering that I was free, at home and so was she, free, leaving school. That was the end of our conversation, period. Over the next few weeks/months I kept seeing her at school seeing as we had similar schedules. We\\'d say hi and she\\'d always chat me up. At first we\\'d talk for 5-10 or more minutes. That faded to just saying hi, to not even acknowledging (or rather avoiding) her most times, even though the only thing I thought about while at school was seeing her.

So I decided I had to confront her, which just so coincided with her birthday. I messaged her at night on Facebook, saying happy birthday. She responded early in the morning, said thank you and that she was heading up to the university. I, as well, had a class so I said I\\'d see her there. I saw her there and we talked for what seemed like an hour. At the end of it, I just confronted her about what had happened, asked her if she was expecting me to make a move (which I obviously knew the answer to, and it was yes), she said yes. Asked her if she\\'d be down to try to get things going now and she agreed. She had another class and I didn\\'t so I left for home and messaged her as soon as I got there. We talked for the entire day, until she went to her birthday party where she wouldn\\'t have access to a phone or internet. We kept talking non-stop every day, and not in a friend kind of way. It was obvious we were getting together. We met up. Texted. Talked. Met up again. Dated for like 3 weeks or a month and while I was very nervous at times, it was the best weeks of my life. I still remember her touch. Her kissing my cheek, my neck. After that she suddenly texts me saying she feels the relationship is heading towards a friendship rather than a girlfriend/boyfriend type of a situation, and that was due to me not showing enough affection, love. An *entire year* of being obsessed with her, finally mustering up the courage to confront her, us getting together only for it to fall apart so quickly absolutely *devastated* me. I was dead. Dead. We agreed on being friends, and we kept in touch. Talked on Facebook and met up from time to time. While I obviously still had feelings for her, and she was aware of it, it wasn\\'t too bad. Yes I was sulking at times, but I was getting by. There were times where I didn\\'t really even think of her that much. - And then this Friday...We decided to meet up because she messaged me saying she missed me a ton (I had seen her over coffee two weeks prior). We met up near our school, walked around for about an hour, then went to a bar where a friend of mine works and drank, but not a lot. Just got tipsy. We probably spent 3-4 hours there, talking non-stop. Then I took her home (which is pretty far away from mine). We sat outside her house at 1am talking and talking. It felt exactly like the times when we were together. And that, I think, was the final nail the coffin. Experiencing a situation so similar to the ones when we were dating brought it *all* back.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'While I was always the shy and quiet kid, I think I would have grown out of that if it weren\\'t for an experience I had when I was 16/17. I went to the gaeltacht (irish speaking summer camp, 3 weeks only speaking irish away from home), when I was 13-15, and it was an amazing experience. I made new friends from all over the country, fell in love with the language, laughed so much every day. We stayed in houses and in each house was 1-2 leaders which were super bubbly talkative people who had to bring us out of our shell, break the ice in the early days, make sure we didn\\'t speak english, and they also ran daily activities. I knew I was shy but I wanted to be a leader and I thought if I didn\\'t know anyone then I\\'d be able to be that talkative and bubbly. When I was 16, I went as a leader. Everyone was SO SO extroverted, and because we were being \"evaluated\" by our superiors, being watched to see how well we mixed and interacted with other people, I got stage fright and didn\\'t talk to anyone. It was horrible, I felt so ashamed of myself for thinking I could do this and for being the only one who was shy. They must have been thinking \"what the hell is she doing here\". Long story short, none of the other leaders liked me. Like, they hated me. They\\'d talk to me and I\\'d be super quiet and they\\'d do the \"okaaaaay\" and their eyes would dart around and smile at someone when they talked to me. They also gave me grief one day because this boy asked me out, they were making fun of me, which hurt because the girl who was laughing at me was once my leader when I was a student, and I used to be the type of kid who would idolise and have faith in people. This experience broke that. We have one day where parents visit and most people go to a neighbouring town for lunch with them, I saw the other leaders and said \"Hi!!\" and they blanked me. To give context, this wasn\\'t a \"job\", leaders tend to form a close knit group, and I was outside of this. We had a day out to the cinema and there was no room on the bus so I had to go in a teachers car. The teacher shouted into the bus \"who wants to come with me and aoiphes in the car?\", no one moved. Anyway, I don\\'t know why exactly but my faith in others and more importantly myself broke, and is still broken. I actually blocked the experience out, I used to think about it at night and literally sweat and cry and push it out of my mind - it was humiliation, 3 straight weeks of it. I\\'m leaving specific bits out because they\\'re hard to describe but a lot of my flashbacks were of peoples expressions of suppressed laughter anytime I spoke to them. Or another leader rolling her eyes at me for not being good enough. It was like, you know when you do something silly by accident in front of people, and you think about it for years but the amount you think of it decreases with time? Well it\\'s like that, only happening continuously for 3 weeks. I honestly think I got PTSD from that experience. It took me years to allow myself to think about it, and it was painful. My description probably doesn\\'t make it sound that bad, but it was just things happening over and over again that confirmed for me that I was a failure and everyone hates me. Learning negative things about yourself one after the other with no time to process. It\\'s been better lately. Sometimes I think about it without cringing.

Hey guys, I've been anxious and depressed enough that I can't take it anymore, when I was the age of 0-14 I was a funny, very social, empathious fun kid. I always had friends, always was a part of everything and everyone recognized me for my laughing. Untill I hit my puberty ( not the reason why I'm anxious I think ) since that time I got even scared to open the door, I still don't have a job ( I'm 16 now ) and I'm currently in wait for my new school which I'm 2 months later then everyone else. Just because I canceled my other school since I was too anxious of finding a internship work place. I still only have old friends from the time when I was 'myself' and no new ones. I've always been very hyper since I was a kid and then my parents decided to diagnose me and turned out I had ADHD. It dind't bother me at that time. I do speak to my parents but not very much. Especially not about my feelings which I don't do with barely anyone. I dissapoint them alot with my anxious feelings for example the one from when I needed to find the internship work place. My mom keeps saying that I'm anxious because I have been judged by everyone my whole life and I know she is right but its not only that, I have also been taking Ritalin for a few years and from that moment everything changed, one day when I felt very anxious after 30 minutes of taking my Ritalin. I was in school at lunch break just with a bunch of friends because I wasn't having those anxious issues then, but I felt very depressed and anxious then and I also later called my mom asked if I could go home because I was feeling sick. I dind't mention that I was anxious to her. Next day I woke up and again took my dose of Ritalin ( I'm not gonna call it medication ) I felt exactly the same as the day before so I called my mom again and asked if I could go home. I still dind't tell about the anxious and negative thought I had. From that moment I wasn't feeling myself untill this day. I am feeling so tired, nothing makes me happy and I just feel so fucking miserable and anxious about even doing the smallest things. The worst thing is that I KNOW I can be myself because I have been in the past, but I don't know how or what to do. I'm also using little doses of sativa or hybrid strains of weed ( I vaporize them ) and it does really help for my ADHD to calm down my brains but it still doesn't make me feel myself happy from how I used to be. Obviously I still have some days where I feel happy but those only happen like once in a month . I also once was out for dinner with the whole fam and I was feeling very drowsy and just not active but I brought my filled vaporizer ( dry herb vaporizer ) with weed. So I vaped outside and I was myself again, I was talking to my fam and it was like I was reborn again. When I got home I was so happy and mostly proud, I later said to my mom what I did when I went outside and she already knew I smoke and shes okay with it as long as I don't get addicted and she also was a bit happy because she really saw the diffrence, its not always when weed works like that. But when I'm with friends and I smoke I always feel very comfortable around them and have a good time. They mostly make me forget to look at my phone so thats a good sign. I really want to feel like how I used to because most people liked me then alot. I also stopped growing from when I was using the Ritalin and last year I have grown so much from the moment when I stopped using it. I feel like ritalin fucked up my serotonin receptors because I know alot about all drugs. I know that Ritalin is in the same family as speed which makes it possible that it fucked up my serotonin receptors. Anyhow I've also tried LSD a couple of times and it made me social anxious as fuck, really dind't wanna see anyone when I did that. But I know that that isn't how I am because I used to be so social but how come I'm not anymore? If anyone has tips or questions. Please feel free to ask / tell them!! I use L-theanine now for a while and it makes me alot more relaxed in my head, but they don't bring back the old me. I don't use chemical pills ever again because they're dangerous and addictive. Not only because they're toxic itself but also because they might have fucked up my whole personality. Its insane that when I think of it now they just give speed to 8 year olds because they have a disorder which makes them hyper in their head. Its not right, thats the reason why I only use natural products to relax my brain, L-Theanine, weed and omega-3. I also have used XTC like 3 times and when I do xtc I can talk to people again with no problem and it just goes extremely easy then. But I don't use it more then twice a year. Please if anyone has any tips or comments pleasee ask or tell them! Also if someone knows how to like boosts my serotonin/dopamine receptors I'd love to hear how. I really wanna get back to the person I used to be. And I'm not the only one.

Now it\\'s even worse though because it happens at work, and I work on movie sets, and on movie sets they usually record sound because it\\'s post-1920, which means everyone on set needs to be DEAD silent. Sometimes there are emotional scenes with long, silent pauses in between actors\\' lines. Sometimes there\\'s just quiet while they\\'re waiting for an airplane to go by. And at the end of every day or when they finish shooting in a particular space, they record \"room tone\" which is just 30 seconds of complete, 100% silence. And usually these spaces are very small and filled with lots of people like the director, the script supervisor, the 1st AD, the DP, the 1st AC, the 2nd AC, the boom operator and/or sound mixer, 1+ talent, possibly other department heads like the gaffer, key grip, production designer, or makeup, possibly multiple PAs there to make sure everybody is quiet, etc. and if you make noise you\\'ve fucked up the take. I have such severe anxiety about stomach noises on set that I basically try to avoid actually being on set as much as possible. I\\'m constantly terrified of getting stuck inside when they\\'re about to shoot, because as an electrician I might need to be nearby for small, last second lighting adjustments, or even worse, to do a light gag (lights go on/off or flicker/dim during the shot). I avoid it at all costs and try to stay in an area with no people or somewhere outside where it\\'s loud.

I\\'ve noticed it seems to happen more when I\\'m anxious, which is almost all the time, and additionally, when I\\'m anxious ABOUT it happening--like it causes itself in a vicious feedback loop.

Basically, I\\'m pretty sure the answer is just relax, just chill out mentally, and your body will respond by being at ease. Obviously this is way easier said than done for people with SA.

            "{'sequence': \"('Social Anxiety from eating in public. Advice on self-help tips for overcoming this?. Sorry in advance for the long story that i’m about to post but I hope you guys give it a read. I’ve been getting social anxiety especially from eating in public for 2-3 years now and the fact that I can’t even have a peaceful/enjoyable meal out with my friends have been eating me inside out and I want to overcome this so so so badly. The past few years has honestly been the worst few years of my life and I so desperately want things to change. The eating anxiety I have doesn’t really come from being afraid of being looked at in public, its more of being afraid that I would gag/throw up when eating because of the intense nauseous feelings I get whenever I am eating outside in public and it simply just kills my appetite. Its like a vicious cycle. This is how it all started. 3 years ago, I was still all fine with very minimal social anxiety. Since young I have always been a shy and quiet person if you don’t get to know me well but among my friends i’d like to think that I am quite talkative and fun. I hung out with friends very easily in school and used to enjoy going out with them. I even had many friends from the “popular” group in school if that’s what you call them. However sadly this changed for the worse in 2017. I was finishing school and was about to enter mandatory military service. I suddenly got so much anxiety ever since I was about to enter military as there was so much uncertainties that I had about it. I was afraid that I would have a tough time, afraid that I would not be able to adapt to a very different environment, afraid of missing home too much etc. To put it shortly, there were so many things that were not under my control that gave me so much anxiety during this period. I was still at school when all these anxiety came about, and it seemed to just keep getting worse during that time. Sometimes in the morning before going to school i’d feel nauseous for no reason, even brushing my teeth in the morning would cause me to gag. Sometimes (even though rarely) I would even have to go to the toilet just because I felt like throwing up from the nausea I was getting. I started losing appetite very easily and started to rarely have a proper meal during lunch time in school. I started avoiding going out with my friends because of all this feelings I was getting stemming from the anxiety I got. Fast forward to now, I have completed my service and about to start uni early next year. I would say that my anxiety has gotten much better compared to where I was a few years back. However I was never the same in terms of eating in public ever since. I still get all nauseous/choked up/no appetite whenever I am eating outside. When I eat at home its the complete opposite, I can properly enjoy a good meal with no issues at all when i’m home, because I feel “safe”, that even if I throw up/gag nobody can notice or judge. And because of this sense of safety, ironically I don’t have any anxiety at all and don’t feel any nausea, However when i’m out I can only eat in small bites and I find it so difficult to even finish a normal meal. Its taken such a massive toll on my social life. In the past I would hang out with my friends every week, and also go outside to play sports every week. Now these things rarely ever happen anymore, not because I wasn’t invited but because I had to reject my friends every time they asked me out because I didn’t want to end up embarassing myself when we have a meal. Honestly this really hurt me so much because my friends probably now thinks I am deliberately avoiding them or that I don’t wanna hang out with them anymore but the truth is I really don’t have a choice because of all the anxiety I have had experienced. Sometimes I just wished that everyone can understand how I feel or what I am going through. I am starting school again in a few months and I really want to just change myself, and go back to my old self where I had no anxiety when eating in public, where I could really feel joy and happiness when going out with my family and friends, where I don’t have to keep worrying about my eating anxiety, and where I can just feel genuinely happy again.

I experienced most/all of the things you mention. I wouldn’t go anywhere for weeks for fear of people seeing me. I was terrified if I went outside to get the mail that a neighbor would see me and judge me. I’d only go grocery shopping at bizarre hours and only use the self check out because of fear of what the cashier would think of me and my purchases. Going to any social event caused panic attacks (sweating, trembling, trouble breathing, chest pain, dizziness). I lived a solitary life and would go months without social interaction. Going so long without having so much as a conversation made me really awkward in any social interaction that I did have. I would be really quiet and keep to myself. Afterwards I’d over-analyze everything that happened, even for days or weeks. So how did I climb out…? Very slowly. I have been on and off antidepressants (SSRIs) since I was 15, never on for longer than 3 months, then I would hop back on when I started to feel really down. I think they helped with the depression, but not so much the social anxiety. I have been on and off therapy as well…and couldn’t really commit to that either. It’s hard to go tell someone your most intimate feelings and thoughts when you’re afraid of how they’re judging you. However, I think it does help some people. I was recommended this [book](It might help. I made one friend towards the end of high school. I had no idea why he wanted to be my friend, but I was so desperate for a friend I just went with it. I found it much easier to just hang with 1 person than a large group that I didn’t know. Then I made one really good friend in my first year of college. She much more actively took action to become my friend, than me becoming hers. We became basically inseparable, and she was my only friend for a while but that was okay because all my social needs were met through her. I transferred schools and she got a boyfriend and our very codependent relationship kinda fell apart. I felt lost for a while, but that is when I realized that I shouldn’t be that dependent on someone else. I made a friend at my new school. I moved on campus and started interacting more with my roommates. I became involved with clubs. I started by just attending talks and meetings, then eventually went onto becoming an officer. A lot of classes were team projects, so I befriended some teammates. I took a teaching assistant position and met people that way. As my circle of friends grew, I met more friends through them. I threw some parties. I went to parties. I learned that sometimes you have to be assertive when making friends. I faked confidence and asked people to hang out, chatted them up online, said hi and talked to them when I saw them. Eventually, it starts to feel less forced and more natural. By the time I graduated I had a great group of friends ranging from very close to not so close. It wasn’t smooth sailing always. I had a really hard time during my internship. I didn’t fit in with the other interns at all. It was like they just looked at me and labeled me as a loser. I felt very socially awkward since most of my friends were also very nerdy/geeky and the interns were a different breed. I did try, but I failed and it was a hard summer for me. I spent most my weekends alone while the others were out doing what interns should do when spending the summer in a beautiful new city. About 6 months ago I moved to a new city, and it’s been tough making friends and adjusting. I feel the insecurities and low self-esteem creeping in on me. I hated constantly meeting new people and small talk. I’m so paranoid that people will see through my confident veneer and find me to be just a giant loser. I miss the easiness with my friends. I tried organizing events with some people at work, but those fell through. Sucks being in a new city with so much to do, but no one to do with it. In the back of my mind, I still fear that if I go do things alone people will see me think of me as a friendless loser. As you can see it’s still a struggle sometimes, but I know I’ve come a long way. I don’t think I’ll ever be the life of the party or 100% not socially awkward. I still have fears and insecurities, but I think the best way to get over them is to just face them. Sometimes you’ll fail real hard, but you’ll learn and get better. I know it’ll be a while before I build a social network like the one I had in college. I’m gonna try taking a fun class after work, meetup.com, and finding a place to volunteer. I’m planning on facing my fear of doing things alone…and I’m gonna go out there and do things alone and hopefully make friends along the way.

By the way, the size of your dick doesn't matter as some girls can't comfortably take a lot anyway. Sex is not a requisite for social status. Don't let society fool you. A relationship will not be healthy in the long term if you are emotionally vulnerable. Take the time to grow and take care of yourself first, worry for yourself before other things. Please stop smoking and drinking alcohol. Find an alternative, even vaping or whatever. When you try a certain way and it doesn't work, try another way. Alcohol is a depressant. Smoking shits on your health. Don't consume them. Take up classes. Dance, martial arts, parkour, cooking, anything. Help the community out, volunteer. The Meetup app has clubs you can join to meet people of similar interests. The best way to rid yourself of social anxiety is through exposure. You can learn social skills. You have so much potential, OP. You just have to keep your head up despite the challenges (it will not be easy), and don't let yourself stop you from progressing. Our biggest demons are not the adversities around us, but ourselves. Keep a realistic mindset and you can get to what you want. Be wary of absolute thinking patterns. You can do it.

Nobody respected me and they obviously talked behind my back because they thought I was annoying or weird or unlikeable and like you\\'ve experienced, they also made these strange proclamations of my name in class too and I think the straw that broke the camels back was when I started to realize that when we had to do the \"find someone to be in group with\" stuff people would walk away as soon as I walked over to them even if I had occasionally talked with them before. It\\'s a testament to how bad my social skills were and how asocial i was outside of classes but what could I do? I couldn\\'t figure it out and people started to think me annoying for it which led to internal bullying. In middle school I had more of it. People would always put me down for whatever I did that wasn\\'t academically succesful which was at least nice so I had something I was okay at, at the time. If I started running people would point and laugh because \"you\\'re a nerd and you can\\'t be sporty\". If I said something I thought was funny then people would default to arrogance and assume what I was about to say would be stupid and then look at each other laughing at what I said as if they were embarrassed I was trying to make eye contact with them because I wasn\\'t worth talking to. I would go as far as to say I have a kind of built up hatred towards people in general over my early schooldays. I know my problems stem from my own lack of putting myself into respect, but sometimes one thing leads to another for no particualr reason and you\\'re put in an unfortunate position for the rest of your time in a group and that can scar you for life if you can\\'t move on from it easily. I don\\'t think often about it admittedly, but if I have to think back in my life all my problems started early on like that. I don\\'t trust people and I assume what I do will be unworthy or stupid or cringeworthy before I even try and i don\\'t take risks because I\\'m afraid people will laugh or ridicule me. It\\'s not irrational. That whole \"anxiety is irrational\" crap is bullshit if you have tried being bullied. It\\'s real and there is a consequence that genuinely hurts if you fail and you\\'ve tried it before, and my worst thoughts tell me that I hate a lot of people for not understanding because they\\'re had it incredibly easy. They\\'ve never fallen out in a group and they\\'ve never done something bad which they couldn\\'t then defend or make up for afterwards. They\\'ve not been stuck in a hole without the skills to crawl up again. They can make it seem like anxiety is strange as much as they like and I\\'ll hate them for it just for their lack of understanding. Anyone who\\'s been a victim of anything will have a newfound dislike for a group untouched by those kinds of circumstances. They don\\'t know anything nor could they care about it unless they try it. That\\'s probably the darkest corners of my mind; the thoughts that say to me that I really want \"good\" people to have it bad. I want people to be bullied like I was.

It all depends on what your goal is like to be just Fit lose couple pounds, To Lose a Ton of weight, or to Gain Muscle. Remember those huge bodybuilders had to start somewhere. What body builders usually do or skinny people is bulk up- eat a ton more then they workout out gain more muscle and strength and then cut- do more cardio eat less to get the sixpack/defined muscles.

Lastly when I got home I ran another mile and for dinner I ate either Starches, Fruits, and Veggies. Sleep is also essential because that\\'s where you lose weight/gain muscle. That would be my \"Diet\" plan to lose weight fast but if you ever want long term results your going to have change your lifestyle/eating habits and either eliminate, reduce, or replace them.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'I froze twise while approching a on Ecstasy.. (Long Post) (Need help) This happened yesterday, their was a fest going on in our University and since it was my last fest, i decided to drop Ecstasy. Since our University is located in a rural area their are no proper bars or pubs to drink, so the students have started drinking in a garden which is 50 metres from our University. This was a three day fest and on day two i went out drinking in this garden. I was drinking with my buddies (all guys) and after some time a group of girls from our University came and started drinking besides us. While drinking i noticed that two girls from that group are checking me out. Something about myself:- I am a 21 year old law student in the last year of his course. I have major social anxiety and in my five years at Uni, i have only socialized with a small group of people in my four years in Uni and almost all of them were guys. This was primarily because i got a cultural shock when i moved from a small town to one of the elitist University in India. I am 6ft 2inch with good facial features but a skinny frame. Generally people rate me 7/10. I was decently confident when i started University, but due to my inability to speak fluent English (which is the primary language of conversation in this place) and the highly urban crowd which i had never experienced before, my self confidence was very badly damaged. On top of that i made friends with people who had the same problem of language and culture like me, people who didn\\'t exactly \\'fit\\' in this place. Irrespective, they were pretty toxic and always discouraged and scrutinized any attempts that I made to socialize with people out of our social circle. They would make fun of me for misspranousning words in my presentation and not able to form a coherent sentence when participating in class or speaking to other students. This led to me becoming more and more anxious leading to a total stop by me to try anything or interacting with new people. I just started keeping quiet in lectures and just didn\\'t interact with anyone in the class and made my body language very unnapprochable. This led me getting isolated, loosing my self worth and growing more and more insecure about myself everyday. I started suppressing my opinions and started doing everything which was acceptable by my isolated group of friends. I turned to weed and used to numb myself with it to coupe with the anxiety but the paranoia kept making it worse. I finally started fighting back from my third year and started working on myself. I started getting better at speaking English, learned a lot of new things, got better at studies and putting my opinion forward. I started being more assertive about my boundaries and stopped my friends from walking all over me all the time. But still there is a lot of anxiety, insecurity and an overall inferiority complex. I have only dated one girl in my life which was long distance, we met twice in 3 months and just made out. I don\\'t consider this a proper relationship though. I have a decent amount of good female friends. But it is very difficult for me to talk to a unknown girl, and usually make a fool of myself. I get a decent amount of female attention and a lot of girls have tried to flirt with me but i just get too anxious and awkward. I start overthinking the interaction and always find a way to convince myself that this one isn\\'t right for maybe the next one. However, now i have changed myself and i am trying to actively communicate with girls. I even approached two girls in the gap of six months and got rejected both the times due to very awkward conversation both the times. I have been feeling very lonely for the past 3 years and i crave romantic intimacy. Coming back to story:- After realising that both of them have been glancing towards me, i started making eye contact with the one I was interested in. However, like always i didn\\'t approach her and just left the place after finishing the booze and even give a look back. The next day( last day of the fest) i popped ecstasy and went to the garden with my friends, i started tripping intensely after i reached the party garden. Coincidentally, the same group of girls from day two came and started drinking 20 meters away from us. At this time i had reached my \\'peak\\' of ecstasy and was tripping major nutsack. The high started reducing and got a collected my self a little bit but i was still pretty high, now i start noticing that the same girl from yesterday was again galncing at me in very short intervals, i started making eye contact with her but would break it in 2-3 seconds because of second thoughts. My friends started leaving for college but i was still pretty high so i decided to stay on my own, i started socialzing with people that i knew and all this while me and that girl kept making eye contact. I still wasn\\'t sure weather i should go and talk to her. Then she looked at me for like 10 seconds without breaking eye contact and gave a huge smile. Because of the lowself esteem idiot that i am, i looked turned my neck in both the directions to confirm that she was actually smiling at me. Any other day I would have bounced from that place without approaching her because of my fear of rejection and making a fool out myself but not this time. This time i was on Ecstasy and wasn\\'t feeling my high level of anxiety which generally happens in these kind of situation. I decided I am going to make to make a move this time. I had promised myself in the summer that I\\'ll try and break my virginity in my last year of law school. I waited for an appropriate moment in which she wasn\\'t occupied too much by her friends. I saw an opening and started walking towards her, she was making her drink from the bottle which was on the ground. I stopped 3 ft away from she turned saw me and smiled like she was expecting me. She turned her head again and i just froze. I couldn\\'t utter a word, and after standing there for like 5 seconds without saying anything. I just walked of from their. I cursed by my self for being so pathetic and thought about going back in the college. But i decided to calm myself and try once again because i was really interested in this girl. I smoke a cigarette, muster all the courage and started walking towards her again, this time she was standing with her friend who were both dancing on rap. I stopped she saw me then started looking at her friend. I am feeling extremely nervous right now but i fight it and after 3 seconds i say \" I am sorry for earlier, i just got nervous\" in a very shaky voice. She responded \"it\\'s okay you don\\'t have to worry about that\" in a very soft tone. I ask her name tell her mine then shook her hand. Another friend of her came thinking that i was making her friend uncomfortable. Her friend who came, starts looking at me in a very suspicious way because it could be interpreted by my face that i was on some hard Drugs ( which i think the girl who i approached also figured out) my anxiety shoot up the roof and i wasn\\'t able to utter even an alphabet. I froze again and walked of again, this time for real. I had a very bad trip after this incident and kept cursing myself for being a losser. I seriously need help as to how to overcome my social anxiety and be self- confident, that why i gave a detailed description of myself. I also got to know that the girl i approached is a mutual friend of a guy freind of mine and he has recommended me to send a insta request and start chatting with her.

            "{'sequence': \"('How social anxiety ruined my life. Hi there reddit, since i am not a native English speaker i'll be using Google Translaitor. I am not seeking for help or life advice i just want to talk. I am 20 and half years old and only now i realised how completely i ruined my life because of the anxiety. And there is no way out for me. As far as I remember myself, I was always a rather shy and closed child, I did not go out outside unnecessarily. My first friends (and the only ones) appeared in my 5th grade. I well remember how we met, it was some kind of event and a couple of guys from my class came up to me and we just started chatting about everything - games, films, football, we chatted for at least two hours and then headed home and exchanged each other with console games. And in my opinion, it was a lot easier to communicate with strangers then. Secondary school, and then in my opinion the first problems appeared. When the homework was a pubic presentation or recitation of a verse by heart, I never completed these homewroks, as a result of which I got F grade and I had to hope only that in future we would no longer have such tasks, I was also afraid to go to the teacher and give me an individual task. In high school, the situation did not change, I was still afraid of public speaking and did not leave home unnecessarily, and when friends called for a walk, I always said that I was busy. A quick fact, in all my life I have never been to a cafe, to the cinema i wasnt even in a store alone. If I needed something, I asked my parents or sister to buy me. In 2016, I passed the exams and entered the pedagogical university at the Faculty of Philology, this was one of the biggest mistakes in my life. Due to the fact that I did not really care about where to go, I had to quickly choose the direction. I had to move from countryside to city (not to far tho, about 130 kms) and learn to live on my own, buy groceries, pay utility bills and most importantly communicate with people, from that moment I no longer saw my friends live, both moved to other cities. Speaking of classes at the university, each English class needed to stand in front of the audience and tell the learned text, there were also quite often group work, and if I could barely cope with the first example, then when we worked in groups I was ready to disappear, run away , do anything if only I were not here, cause i simply cant talk to people which i dont know, My palms and forehead began to sweat. No kidding, when I reached the bus stop and went to the university, for me it was a real challenge. What makes me even more anxious is that there were 22 girls and 6 boys in the group keying me. I went through anxiety for two months until one day I decided not to go to university, and from that moment on, my life went awry. I began to skip classes more and more, sleep problems started, I went to bed at 8 in the morning, and got up at 7 in the evening and my parents didnt even know about this situation. With bad points, but I still went through the first semester. But in the second situation did not change, I was not at the university for exactly a month and none of my classmates, headmen or curator were interested in what happened to me. By the way, in January 2017, I stopped talking with one of my friends, the communication just broke due to some little trifle I don’t even want to mention it. April 2017, the curator told his parents that I did not attend classes, but I in turn made promises that I would attend classes. One day, after a long absence in class, the curator called me to his place and began to ask me what was happening to me, I had good points for the first months of my studies, and then everything went awry. After the conversation, she advised me to turn to a psychologist, but I immediately rejected this idea, although now, I understand that it might be worth giving this idea a chance. Even the girls from the group offered me their help, but I refused, i decided that it will be extremley hard to comeback.I just don’t have the courage to approach the teacher and ask for additional classes. As a result i was expelled from university. While I was in the city alone, I talked a lot about what to do next. They set me up as an example for my sister, laid more hopes on me, but I just didn’t live up to these hopes, I myself was not in awe of myself, I considered myself miserable and that there was no place for me like this in this world, so I decided that the best option there will be suicide. I decided to hang myself in the closet and when I felt cramps and lack of oxygen, a stupid thought crept into my head and said to me “Do not do this, give yourself a chance”. Now, I really regret that I succumbed to that thought and did not finish what it would be worth In September 2017, I entered college and again, in November 2017, I was expelled. Classical history, anxiety, unwillingness to leave the dorm room due to loneliness, although I understand that I had to go to college and university not for communication, but for education. For almost 2 years now I have been living with my parents in the village, I leave the house only to throw snow from the yard, I haven’t been talking with my last friend since January 2019. My younger sister graduated from college, works and receives money, while I just sit on the neck of the parents.

First date we just went to the movies and later ate at a restaurant and walked around after that day she ghosted me for 2 weeks and then started talking to me again and said sorry and wanted to try again. Second date I went hiking with her and watched the sunset and ate at a pizza place after that day she avoided me for a few days with a bunch excuses then asked me out again and I was like sure. Third date we went to a restaurant then walked by the beach and saw the sunset she kissed me that night and told me why she avoided me all those days apperntly she was scared we would destroy our friendship and she already lost her bofriend and didnt wanna lose me too well I accepted her but few days later I went out with a cousin to watch some movies and a saw her walking with her neighboor (she told she was studying at home ) and then they started kissing they looked so inloved. It kinda hurt becuase she was my befriend and lied to me. But I grabbed my phone took a picture of them send it to her and told her with a message \"I just saw you And I dont think we can be friends anymore\" and I ghosted her after that I cut all contact with friends of hers and family (first time I ghosted someone).

Eventually it got to my turn in the game and I asked if I could just pass it to the next person, because I was feeling extremely anxious at this point, but they insisted I just read the card. I tried reading the card but they couldn\\'t really understand me so my boyfriend had to take the card and read it. I felt embarrassed and just sat there feeling really anxious. I felt so out of place in that moment and I just wanted to escape. I snuck away from the table and sat on the couch by myself and started hyperventilating. I texted my boyfriend if I could leave because I\\'m having a panic attack, a few minutes pass and he tells me to \\'go outside\\', but I didn\\'t want them to see me walk outside or question me...so i just sat there and started crying. A few more minutes pass and my boyfriend came over to me and asked me if i wanted to go outside with him, and we did. I was judging myself so hard and i felt so upset at myself for taking my boyfriend away from the party, but he tried his best to take care of me. We stayed the night at the friends house and I was up most of the night feeling really sick. It\\'s the next day and I apologized to my boyfriends coworker, telling her i had a bit of a panic attack, she was understanding.

Back in my home country, I did not have this debilitating sense of dread whenever I needed to go outside. I have lived in Asia and went to an international school since the second grade. I had a lot of confidence in myself, as well as a decent group of friends. I still wasn't the most social guy, but I had friends I could relate to. I was able to go to malls, shopping centres, cafes and what not, and converse with the cashier/waitress as a normal person would, although I was a bit awkward. Since then, I've moved to the UK for my undergrad, and man I've basically become a shut-in here. I am too shy to make friends with the local students, I feel like my english despite being good enough is different from the way its spoken in Britain, hence whenever I try to start a conversation, my sentences tend to be incomplete and simply words strung together without a proper structure. My self-esteem has suffered deeply because of this. It's been a year and a half now, and its not getting any better. I'm feeling a mixture of denial and knowing that I shouldn't feel this way because I could function normally back home, as well as anger at myself because I just can't help myself to get out of this condition. I refuse to acknowledge that I have a problem, and I keep looking for reasons as to why I might be the way I am now. Here's how my daily life feels like to me: I leave my apartment complex and walk to university. On my way, I feel that everybody is looking at me, judging me for being so awkward and lame. Once I get to the lecture rooms, people are conversing outside, talking to each other while waiting for class to start. I see people I've talked to before, but for some fucking reason I decide not to make eye contact and sit/lounge around alone. I take out my phone, hoping that nobody notices that I am a loner. I walk into the class, and am greeted by the sight and sound of hundreds of students in this massive lecture hall. I try not to make a fuss about it but I am actually panicking about where I would be able to sit down, without attracting attention to myself. I finally find a place and a couple of people in a group decide to sit next to the empty spots next to mine. They're talking, having a lot of fun, asking each other about how last night's party was and what not. And I'm just there, probably they're oblivious to me even being there. Once lecture finishes, and classes are done for the day, I immediately walk back to my room. This walk back is often filled with bitterness and intense feeling of loneliness, as I pass by other students walking with their friends. The worst part of all this is that I can't figure out why I am the way I am now. Why could I function normally, and live without fear back home but once here I'm afraid of the outside world. I'm afraid of the eyes that aren't probably even looking in my direction, of the laughter I hear around me, thinking that it must be at my expense, while simultaneously knowing that it isn't. I am stuck and I don't know why.

I am new to reddit, I felt it was a good move to make so I could learn about and finally feel calm, knowing that I am talking to people who take this sort of thing seriously. I'll give some background... I am a 16 year old male. I have suffered from social anxiety/phobia for the past 3 or 4 years. I have no idea what went wrong or where. I used to be able to go the shop on my own, but now... I don't even go there. I am too scared. Even in broad daylight... I am petrified of going. I don't know who I'll bump into or whatever. I think my anxiety is because I am fearful of what people are capable of. I am a very weary person, and I trust no-one to begin with. I really dislike it when someone says it's just because I'm shy. NO. It's not. You don't quite know how I feel. This is more than being shy. It's fear. I have never been one to make a fuss of anything. I have never been the 'class clown', I have only been in one detention (that was for forgetting a ruler in maths, lol) and I haven't been to the headmasters office. I feel a bit like Elliot from Mr. Robot if anyone knows what that is. I DESPISE going outside in urban areas. I cannot stand densely populated area. My parents often ask me if I want to go on a walk with them and the dog. All too often, I say no. It's not because I'm lazy; rather fearful of who's outside and who might see me. I almost hate everyone at school. Except from a few people. People I associate with. People I know and can trust. Trust has also been a big issue with me. At this moment in time, the only people I trust enough are 2 of my friends and my family. My mum is very supportive. (Not saying my dad isn't, it's just that my mum is the first port of call for me) Like I say, I never leave the house unless it's completely necessary. Maybe I hate society. I stay inside other than when I have to go to school. I hate parties. I hate crowded areas. I cannot speak on the spot if someone questions me about something. I just freeze and stutter... just pushing any old bull**** out of my trap. On a weekend, I spend probably 1/2 of my day in my room. Doing stuff on my computer or just playing games. Enough rambling on. I'll just break down my diagnosis into bullet points for the most relevant things... I cannot make eye contact I hate going outside. I dislike most people at my school I sit at my computer neigh on all day doing stuff I shouldn't be doing I cannot speak in front of people I do not know This one I HATE. If I saw someone getting bullied, hurt or anything, I would probably do nothing because I would be too scared to do anything about it. I CANNOT HELP THIS!! I am a very, very, very, very, very, very, private person. Words can't express how private I am. No-one knows much about me. (Except for family, obviously). No-one externally if you will.

I\\'m 14 and I believe is have had social anxiety for pretty much my entire existence so far. Let\\'s take it back to preschool. I remember looking at myself and always thinking \"I\\'m fat\". I know I was young, but I was extremely skinny, but all I saw was fat when I looked down, and actually tried to keep it a \"secret\" from school and my family.i guess the next instance started around 3rd grade. That was the summer after my great grandma died. She used to live next door, and every day I thought about seeing her. She was an amazing woman that I miss so much. After she passed, I felt at loss for quite a while. The year after, bullying started kicking in. I actually became overweight, really saw no difference than before. I was teased for being fat, or stupid, or told I \"liked boys\". I pretty much felt no need for social interactions any time after that. I know I was young, but of course that shit still happens today to me. As of my current situation, doing almost anything social wise is difficult. The best way I can describe it is like a huge amount of embarrassment before the actual event. But it\\'s really worse than I am describing it. It feels like any action I take in some sort of social area (school, restaurant, store, park, ect.) someone there is either watching me do it and thinking badly of me, which I hate, or I am constantly going over in my had be bad things people will say to me. Confrontations are another big issue for me. If I want something, I would rather miss out than ask for it. It makes me feel like I am burdening someone else\\'s life for my own needs, and that they might think badly of me. This ranges anywhere from asking my brother to help me with homework to even just asking someone to point me in the direction of the soup isle in a store. It is also very difficult for me to do anything social wise that could result in me screwing up, even tho 90% of the things that get to me have a 0% screw up rate. This anxiety has gotten to the point where I cannot even enter a grocery store alone out of fear that someone is watching me (although when I am forced to, i always use self checkout) so that is most of my anxiety.

To start things off: i\\'m 21 years old, i\\'ve been a shut-in since i ended highschool (4 years now...) and i\\'m struggling, really hard, to start something up again. Mostly out of anxiety and fear. God .. okay. So i became a shut-in after some personal issues, including trying to figure out what the hell was going on with my life... having a huge fear of failing things and getting nervous about anything social. I remember my mother telling me that it\\'s just shyness in general but i knew that it was way different, it wasn\\'t shyness, it was actual fear. I\\'m always been a little bit afraid of everything that i\\'m doing. An obvious thing is the pressure of being interesting and not a bore around others. Another one is cooking for others: it feels like they expect me to do at least a good job, but if i mess up i get a hard anxiety attack and start crying. And if i\\'m tasked to do something for someone, like a job task, which i\\'m paid for, i think about it in circles before i even do it, and i imagine what things could go wrong, and how i should do it perfectly, or else i picture people around me laughing or making fun out of me. I was kind of teased that way while growing up... Anyways, things like going outside, making phone calls, interacting with strangers all day makes me feel terrified and sick to my stomach. Work makes me anxious. I\\'m absolutely afraid of starting to work, even though i know i should. I feel like a leech to my parents. I just can\\'t bring myself to start working, because it seems to be this huge terrifying place where people are yelling at me what to do, and if i mess up i\\'m going to be punished, in the social sense. I have this screwed up idea of how the world works, even though i haven\\'t been outside... at all. It\\'s like something i rely on and believe is true even if i agree that the world doesn\\'t work that way. It\\'s hard unsticking myself from it... This is rambly. Anyways, the stupid thing is, if i force myself to go outside, and for example, take a walk... then after i\\'m done with it it doesn\\'t feel that bad. I feel, okay, i can handle this, this wasn\\'t as bad as i thought. So clearly i just have to force myself out to experience it even if it wrecks me. It\\'s still really difficult. While inside, shielded from the outside world, a (figurative) voice in the back of my head tells me that the outside world is still scary, and the times i\\'ve been taking a walk doesn\\'t matter. I feel like i\\'m completely submitting myself to the inner fear, \\'ego\\', whatever whenever this happens. It tells me that i should feel scared, and worry about things, and think \"what if\"... it fools me in to thinking that it\\'s for my own best. I can recognize this yet i feel powerless to change it. Until i actually take the first step, which feels like the hardest thing in the universe, and it dissolves right in front of me. I recently did an experiment with my boyfriend, where, when he would be brutally honest and criticize my bad habits (which i\\'m thankful for) i would stop fighting and just \"give up\", something i fear a whole lot. Whenever someone would criticize me, i would feel a need to fight back, in order to prove myself, to not be seen as weak, or whatever. I gave up and admitted that i was wrong, and it gave me such a relaxed feeling that i have never felt before. It felt like i could finally relax my muscles, and stop worrying about what he, or other people thought about me, and as a consequence i didn\\'t feel any social anxiety, or any anxiety for that matter. I think this \\'ego\\' is the root of the problem, making me worry about behaving in a \"good\" way, so that people will like me. This makes sense as when i was a child/teen, people used to avoid me for some reason. So at least i have something to work with. I hate worrying about things way too much, i hate thinking about things in circles before even doing something, i hate thinking i know how it\\'s gonna play out even if it never does. I never am right in my predictions and yet i think it\\'s the safest way to go. It\\'s stupid. I wish i could do something as simple as getting a job, and handle my own life, but i can\\'t.

Here are some things about me: When I'm walking outside in public, WITHOUT a friend, I get self conscious and anxious, which causes me to walk faster and take routes with less busy streets. My main fear when I'm in public is that I will meet or be noticed by someone I know, causing them to make false assumptions about me depending on my location and situation. E.g if someone sees me walking in a bad neighborhood, I'm afraid of them assuming I'm a criminal When I am in public WITH a friend, however, it's much easier and I get less anxiety. I freak out when I am called on by the teacher to read or present in front of the class. When my class is taking turns reading out loud, I will quickly skim through the paragraph before everyone else to prepare in case I get picked to read next When I present to the class, I stutter and can't keep my body still (moving my hands excessively, walking around, etc.) Unless they are my close friends or family, I stutter and tend to look down when I'm having a conversation with another person. I get anxiety when making or receiving phone calls. When I receive a call, I ignore it and later text the person saying that I was busy I reread my emails and make revisions several times before sending them. When I want to say something out loud to another person or a group of people, I repeat the sentence in my head a few times to make sure the wording doesn't sound wrong. I hate standing up in class, whether it's to go to the restroom or to give something to the teacher. When I'm talking to someone, it helps to stand a couple of feet away from them.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'What is this? (x-post /r/Anxiety). Decides to put this here because I only got one response. Anyway, here goes: I feel like some kind of imposter here, I haven\\'t been diagnosed with anything, but I know there is something wrong with me. Where to begin... So, I think I could be described as a quiet, shy, introverted (I know being shy and introverted are two different things), and reserved person. I always have been, so far, at least. I\\'m 15. It goes a little further than that though. I\\'m incredibly socially awkward, and I really don\\'t know what to say a lot of the time. If a conversation dies out, I feel like it\\'s all my fault because I\\'m not interesting. I\\'ve avoided Skype calls with a close friend numerous times because of this, and I feel like every time I decline a request to call, they\\'ll stop being my friend. Like they\\'ll hate me or something, even though I know that\\'s bizarre. Also, I have friends I\\'ve met online that I\\'ve known for well over a year now, and I even feel uncomfortable talking in calls with them, so I usually lie and say that I can\\'t talk right now, and just type instead. I also hate going outside, ever since I was a kid. My sister loved(s) going to the park; I didn\\'t want to, I wanted stay inside all day, but my mum made me go. But recently it\\'s gotten worse. A lot worse. I took a day off school two weeks ago. I pretended to be sick. Long story short, I\\'m not exactly in a happy place right now, and I just couldn\\'t go in. Fake smiling, fake laughing - I was sick of it. Then there\\'s also, what I can only presume, are panic/anxiety attacks (quickened breathing, shaky hands, tight throat). Which is kind of why I\\'m here. I\\'ve only ever had one of these (I think) months ago, way back at the start of 2016 in my house. And that sucked like hell. Now I\\'ve started to get them at school. They usually occur just after a maths lesson has finished. I just get this overwhelming feeling of fear, and all I could think was \"What the fuck is wrong with me? I need to get out of here now,\" and \"There\\'s nothing wrong with you, it\\'s all in your head; man up.\" \"Man up\" - that phrase has been drilled into me. After the bell goes and we get to leave, I usually go straight to the toilets in one of cubicles and stay there for 5-10 minutes (during break/lunch break) to calm down. Then I have to leave so I don\\'t look weird and my friend(s) ask me where I\\'ve been. That brings me to today, I pretended to be sick again today to have the day off. Same reasons - unhappy and panic/anxiety attacks. I also feel constantly uncomfortable in social situations (so, all 6 hours of school. Yay), I have a big fear of judgement of others and base my self-worth on that - which is why I have very little of that, but also self-esteem and confidence. I only ever feel normal (mostly) when alone, and even then I\\'m thinking how I have to get up at an absurdly early time in the morning to go to a school I hate and talk to people when I\\'d rather shut myself in all day. Weekends are a goddamn blessing; I get to sleep the day away. I\\'m amazed how I\\'ve managed to even keep two friends and have them both even like me enough to want to talk and hang out with me. There\\'s clearly something not right but I\\'m not sure what. I\\'ve taken two days off school because of people...I know that sounds pathetic, but that\\'s because I probably am. Am I over-dramatizing this? I should also add that no one else in the world knows about this except me (duh), a close online friend, and well, you.

            "{'sequence': '(\\' High school baggage (self-therapy; long rambling). I\\'m trying to work through some stuff in my own head, so no one needs to read or reply to this. I visited my high school on the pretext of seeing the new renovations, but I actually just wanted to feel like I could walk everywhere without fear. Even though I graduated five years ago, I still felt nervous. Even though the school is on winter break and campus was empty, I found myself hesitant to walk where there were usually people. Even five years later, my automatic reaction was to walk away the moment I thought I heard someone and to put on my practiced facial expression as if someone were watching me. I was still scared to walk around campus, but I made myself do it (albeit there was no one there), telling myself that this is my campus too, that I didn\\'t have to run away and that I have a right to be there. High school was about hiding. During lunch, I sat behind pillars and bushes, in bathrooms, classrooms and locker rooms. I walked quickly from class to class with my head down. I stayed in a corner in the library as much as I could. I didn\\'t have a single friend in high school in spite of my initial efforts to reach out to people. I joined a soccer team; I quit because of the name-calling. I joined voice lessons; I quit because of the name-calling. On my first day of class in my first year, someone came to sit next to me, but his friend pulled him away saying loudly, \"I\\'m not sitting next to *her*.\" These were all people I\\'d never met, I was totally new to the school district. In math class, my table group never worked problems with me. Instead, they ignored me, talking to each other in another language, sometimes about me, not even realizing that I understood everything they said. A few times, I tried to sit with people during lunch, people I had met and managed to talk to in a friendly way during class, but they all got up and left together each time. Of course I had to save my dignity and stop acting desperate. From day one, I was marked as a pariah. I don\\'t know why or how I became the constant outcast except that I was new to the district. But for four years, I couldn\\'t eat before or at school. I developed a binge-eating disorder, which still comes up once in a while. I shut down and did nothing but academically-oriented work, never going to a social situation, except prom, which my parents forced me to attend. Those same people I had talked to before said I could join them, probably because it would be rude to say no outright. But of course they walked away and avoided me the whole event. Visiting the high school campus was painful. Objectively, I know that all of this is in the past and that I should be able to move on. But the reality is that the SA that I face every day is in large part due to the ostracizing and name-calling from high school. The past is still a living part of the present. I thought that by visiting campus, I could get some closure. Instead, it\\'s dredged up all the stuff I try not to think about. The only thing I can say is that I can see a bit more clearly what my behavioral pattern is--hiding and making myself as invisible as possible because if they can\\'t see you, they can\\'t hurt you. But I\\'ve gotten so used to making myself as invisible and unobtrusive as possible that I can\\'t make friends. I\\'ve never dated. The one time I mustered the courage to ask a guy to hang out with me, he invited his roommate to join, making it a group activity and proceeded to leave me with her. Writing that out makes me realize how calculated that was; that was actually quite mean. I\\'m always on the defense from people and their attention. But all of this isolation hurts. I\\'m hurting myself in the present because other people hurt me in the past and because I\\'m convinced that people will hurt me in the future. I don\\'t know how I can try anymore. It must be so nice to be normal and be able to share the world with people, without fear, instead of feeling like you\\'re imprisoned in your own head. \\')', 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with negative effect', 'outdoor activity or space with positive effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect'], 'scores': [0.4025185704231262, 0.3017938435077667, 0.29568755626678467]}\n",

I don\\'t know where to start or what to say or how much to say but all I know is that I need help Long story short I moved countries for my boyfriend and a couple years later and I think I\\'ve gained some unhealthy habits and I have huge social anxiety now and feel completely vulnerable and alone and it\\'s ruining my relationship as well as myself. Here is some more background info for anyone who may be able to give me any good advice, I would really appreciate it. I\\'m a 20 yr old female and I fell in love a couple years ago and moved countries for my boyfriend, we are still together and i believe things are much better than before. You have no idea how hard this move has been on me. I used to be so happy and outgoing and have my close few friends and old high school friends. I used to do my own thing, I used to be so independent. First let me say that I love my boyfriend incredibly and we both plan to spend the rest of our lives together and have a family, build our home and we are already working on our business together. It has been a couple years and I still don\\'t know how to speak the language here. I do not have a car or a drivers license and I work from home. I feel I am so reliant on him for everything. I feel I am so needy and attached to him always. We spend every day together and yes we take our space but I wouldn\\'t want it any different. Now with the crime etc here and with how I stand out we both aren\\'t comfortable with me taking the bus let alone running in the area we live. This is another problem. I know a group of people that speak English and we sort of get along but I feel no matter what I do not click with any of the girls here. I have always had troubles being friends with girls though, they don\\'t seem to take a liking to me and I\\'ve accepted that and continue to be as nice and genuine as possible. I used to have a bunch of guy friends but now that I am in a serious relationship ( I should note this is my first relationship ) I don\\'t think that it is very appropriate to make close guy friends but I get along well with my boyfriend\\'s friends though. With the language I\\'ve been excusing it and excusing it and Now that I live here I feel I have become shy because I hate being laughed at for not knowing the language, I get so much anxiety when we are out and there is lots of people and my boyfriend is talking to people I don\\'t seem to recognize or know, or even people I do know and it\\'s in their own language and I just close in and feel so alone and so invisible to everyone. I try to learn a bit but guess I get frustrated and shut down easily. I am forcing myself to pay for 1on1 private lessons though and I feel this is a huge block that is one of the main problems for me. I hate being the center of attention as well and I think that I am a very insecure woman now that I am in this relationship. The way I think about myself can at times be terrible, I\\'m great for overthinking and my poor boyfriend gets to deal with it all. I know that from a young age because of dad issues or whatever I have abandonment problems and although I think my boyfriend would never and know that he has never done anything behind my back involving another woman I still feel like I will lose him at times and I feel like i am not good enough. As you can probably tell I have serious insecurities about myself, what I believe are abandonment issues, social anxiety, a language barrier, I am too dependent on him, uncomfortable to walk the streets alone, a hard time making friends, a hard time even going out of my comfort zone, sometimes suffer from bouts of depression etc and it is hard on both me and my boyfriend. I broke down yesterday because I was holding it all in for so long and I didn\\'t want my boyfriend to know because honestly he is so used to me crying I feel like it doesn\\'t even phase him but he came in the room and I couldnt hide it anymore and he actually cried with me because he couldn\\'t believe how I was feeling about myself etc. But today we went to an event and it was so overwhelming for me there was so many people and I started panicking inside and tried to keep it to myself but he sensed it and then as we were leaving I asked if he wanted to get a beer before we went to this other event (work) and he said no and that we had to go to that event right away but then he saw his friend opened a bar and we went to say hi and the guys completely ignored me and they all talked to eachother in their language and again it hit me and I felt so worthless to be standing there just looking at the ground trying to keep it together and then he asks me if we can have a beer with them and that stung because I just got turned down when I asked. We ended up leaving anyway and he noticed I was a little upset and I asked him about the beer thing and the friends who wouldn\\'t even look at me and then he started getting pissed off and He makes this comment \"why can\\'t we go just one day without it turning bad \" and I started crying and there was a point I was upset with him and said fuck you and had a short rant and he said \"you don\\'t even try to get better\" \"I don\\'t deserve this\" \"I can\\'t even say hi to my friends\", he totally lost his cool and was yelling and speeding at times and I just kept fucking crying, he also asked why for once I can\\'t make it all about me and even though i feel he took things way too far I understand and I feel like a peice of shit and am so upset with myself. Please why can\\'t I be fucking normal again I feel almost trapped right now but when I\\'m good things are amazing but no when he tells me that stuff I just feel like it would be better if I just left for good. I am hurting so much. Please someone help talk to me I have no one to go to and he was the only one I poured my heart and soul to. He knows everything about me, but when he goes and says this I feel like he just doesn\\'t care and I feel I\\'d be better off gone. But when I think about it he is my everything. He is all I have.

            "{'sequence': \"('What is it?. Hi, I'm a 22 year old male from the UK. It has just hit me that I might be suffering from some form of social anxiety. I know it's not something you can easily diagnose, as being shy is common and often just a stage in someones life, but I think it's more than shyness for me. I can speak to other people fine, and will smile at the barista or laugh with somebody if the situation is so, so I wouldn't class myself as shy. I can hold a conversation with a stranger well enough. What I think is my problem is that I always feel like I have to prepare myself before I go out. Regardless of how well I think I'm dressed, or whether I have a fresh haircut or whatever, I feel unready to be in the gaze of others if I'm not physically and mentally prepared. If I don't know that I'm being looked at/am in the presence of others or if I'm not prepared mentally to be looked at/to be in the presence of others, I feel very uncomfortable. Don't ask me what my mental preparation is, because I have no clue. My physical preparation is fairly normal for a young male, it's just the mental side. I also just always feel like I'm being watched when I'm walking in public. Like everyone I pass stares at me for a second longer than they do at other people, because I don't fit in. Truth is, I look 'normal'. I'm from an ethnic minority, but who the hell cares about that (especially at uni). I don't think I look particularly attractive or unattractive. The issue came to fruition in Uni, when I began to be out and about more generally. I was a bit overweight, but not by majorly so, and my self-consciousness with that made me hate being in public. I'd want to be out of sight as soon as possible, and it was like a massive burden was lifted off my shoulders when I'd reach my room. Since then I've lost a lot of weight so that I'm really like any other young adult male (if a bit on the skinny side, but that's because I'm into running), and yet the feeling of being out of place still hasn't changed. I'm still at uni (in my final year), and it has improved a lot. Losing weight helped, and generally becoming more comfortable with how I look. I think that was one of my major problems. I was very self conscious with my looks. I hated the way I looked with glasses because I thought it made me look even weirder, to the extent that I wouldn't wear glasses when my prescription is such that I should wear them all the time. I'd rather be basically blind and live in a blur than to look that extra bit weirder. That continued on for a long while, until I realised that it was affecting how people I knew thought of me because they'd pass right by me or wave at me and I'd blank them because I couldn't see them. That's different now, I think I've come to terms with my image. I look different, but I'm fine with that because we all do, and I'm no beast or whatever. I'm a lot more comfortable in public too and will go out even when I don't particularly need to, but there's still that something that makes me falter before I go out in the morning, and sometimes I don't even want to leave my room. That is what has made me think that there's something more to my condition than just having body image issues. There's no better feeling than getting back into my room and being out of sight after a long day at uni. I read somewhere that this is just a symptom of being an introvert, but I don't think I am your usual introvert. I enjoy meeting new people, and sometimes I really crave it. It's not social interactions that exhaust me, because I get this need to hide away after simply being out and having not even talked to anyone. So is this the right place for me? Do you think I have social anxiety issues? I don't think it is the body image issues that I've had in years gone by, but then again I've never really looked for professional help for anything like this. I don't know.. honestly I'd just be glad if there was someone else who had the same issues, someone that I could to talk to about them? Thanks for reading all of that. It's the first time I've ever actually typed out my feelings about it, and really is a relief in itself, so thanks for being a part of that even if there is nothing you can suggest.')\", 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with negative effect', 'outdoor activity or space with positive effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect'], 'scores': [0.4436943233013153, 0.3116283714771271, 0.24467727541923523]}\n",

            "{'sequence': '(\\'22M, live abroad is killing me. Hello reddit, I moved to Europe, when I was 14. My mother already lived there for 3 years and I lived in Ukraine with my grandparents. I was never really asked if I wanted to move but I also didn\\'t think about living in other country and leaving everything behind as a big problem. First half of the year was a horror. I spoke to almost no one. I learned German for a year prior to moving to Europe and it was not enough for me to instantly make friends. Also, the last couple of years at school in Ukraine were pretty difficult for me, as I was constantly bullied. I was weak and skinny and didn\\'t know how to protect myself. But even then, I didn\\'t have any other problems outside school. So, back to Europe, from my first days here, I tried to speak to my new schoolmates as good as I could. But I also started to shield myself from people. Like, if I try to look unfriendly or dangerous, nobody will try to make fun of me. I behaved myself like this, when I was in public. It\\'s not, like I was being impolite to people, but I tried to always have this \"don’t mess with me look\", if this makes any sense. However, knew country, new rules. I didn\\'t have to be afraid of being attacked physically. Instead I couldn’t argue or counter jokes from my classmates. This time I was vulnerable not, because I was weak, but because I didn\\'t know the language well. I also went to a second school simultaneously. My week looked like this: twice a week a returned home at 8pm, because of two schools, where I hadn\\'t time to go home between them. The rest of time I had to study. My first winter holidays, which I spent back in Ukraine, were both a relieve and a horror. I had to go privately to a German teacher almost daily. In first summer I had about 3-4 teachers to prepare me for both schools. All this was awful, but stilly I had my friends at home and was overall happy. **Until one day it started.** I was going back from my German teacher (who was a really nice person, and who taught me really a lot grammar, that helped me immense with my German, so it\\'s not like I totally hated learning German). But let\\'s go back. So, I was going back from my \"class\". I was a usual way for me: just a bit uphill along the road towards the bus stop. Suddenly it was more difficult for me to breath and I felt like, if I would start breath more, people would notice it and, that I looked really awkward. After that, I drove back home and felt myself completely normal. But this situation repeated itself more and more during that summer. I started to notice the way I breathe even on my way to the teacher. I think, this is where it all started. As I was back in Europe, I started being conscious about how I move my feet or my arms. I was always aware of where I was looking at, how my lip was positioned. I didn\\'t know how to look in people\\'s eyes, whether I looked unfriendly etc. I still had no friends at European school, I haven\\'t had any walks which I had constantly with my friends back in Ukraine. It looked like the kids where either going out the way I didn\\'t understand or the didn\\'t do it at all. Years went by, the only time I enjoyed my life, was when I had winter or summer holidays and was back in Ukraine. There I could talk to people, I even managed to make new friends, with whom I still have good contact. I just felt myself normal. After about 2-3 years later, I managed to tell my mother, that something was wrong with me. (It\\'s not easy for a kid to admit, that something is wrong with his head! And I didn\\'t have a good connection to my mother at that time) She took me to her psychiatrist. I was prescribed with some weak antidepressant. I guess I helped with my mood a bit, but it had done shit to my social anxiety. I just tried to suppress the way I felt and had from time to time breakdowns. My only dream was to finish school and University and leave that fucking country. Since no one here needed me, I decided, I would manage everything on my own. I finished both schools. It may sound like it isn\\'t bad after all. Well, no. All this time it felt like I lost that autopilot and had to manually control the way I move, or where to look at the person I speak to. I still didn\\'t feel connected to people around me. I could not make jokes, which the class would find funny. I didn\\'t speak to anyone outside my class. I felt isolated and people around me perceived me the same way. I wasn\\'t interested in my future carrier or, in what to study. My only dream was to leave this country. Instead of leaving, I thought, that it would be a waste to give up an opportunity to study in Europe. I also didn\\'t want to disappoint my relatives. And, to be honest, I was afraid to change anything, go back home and take exams to be able study there. I also didn\\'t want to look like an idiot, coming back, when everybody else wanted to leave Ukraine for better future. I think, I should have done that. If not for studying, but just to have a year off, relax, get rid of SA and may be come back to study. (It\\'s important to mention, that most of the social anxiety symptoms weaken, after I get back home for, at least a month. But even from the first day on, I always felt myself a lot better ) But I haven\\'t done that. Instead I thought, I could power myself thought University, get a bachelor and leave this fucking country forever. I tried studying two different faculties, I hoped, that at the University I would finally able to connect to new people and have fun (so that I would even decide to stay in Europe). That never happened. I tried to study mechanical engineering, but from the beginning the math was just unmanageable for me and I couldn’t find a group to study together. Well, if I can\\'t have fun talking to someone new, since I am to anxious, I can\\'t fit in a group to study, because you must speak there and, like, make friends :) In Europe there are no persistent classes at the Universities. You either have a lection in a huge auditorium or have smaller classes, with 20-40 persons for something like practicing math, where you must solve your prepared homework in front of whole group. I had to do it twice and I felt almost like I am fainting. The most time I spent at home, where I didn\\'t have to feel constant fear and be in fight or flight mode. During one summer in Ukraine I met my current girlfriend. Later, I decided to study CS at a so-called University of Applied Science, where after three years of fixed classes I would have my bachelor and could go back to Ukraine. I had to wait almost a year to sign me up for that University. In the meantime, I found a job, where I am basically all levels of support and a junior sysadmin at same time. (Back in European school a had a specialization in IT because of which we had one year more of school. And the specialization made me hate IT so much, that I didn\\'t realize, that I actually like it) The job was fantastic the only \"problem\" was, that every year in August they organized an event for different political, technical, economical, etc topics) and I had to be there for month. During that time I had both to do IT Stuff and help prepare everything for the conference (cheap student labor :D) But that one month of constant work (not 8/5) just crushed me. My anxiety escalated to some new levels, I was constantly stressed. I was still extra anxious after work but also looked forward to study something I wanted, the way I thought could be the best for me. I expected, that only mathematics would be hard for me, but I also knew you that it would not be as difficult as in a normal University. I was so fucking wrong about everything. The amount of information was huge. We had constant projects in most of the classes. Moreover, there are supposed to be a lot of group projects. The groups where created all by themselves. I didn\\'t want to be that person without a group and be assigned to somebody I didn\\'t like. All of this made me extremely anxious. Additionally, to my social anxiety I became anxious about everything else. I had to finish every assignment, otherwise I would fail either the final project or the test and then after 3 repeat I would have to repeat the semester. And if you didn\\'t manage to do the first assignment, you will still have to do it, since every next assignment is built upon previous. But most important, I could not manage to make social contacts. I was truly afraid of people. It seems, like we have no similar interests. I still do not know how to connect to them. People in Europe just feel so alien to me. Here in Europe, at my University I felt like a totally different person. I had a lot of breakdowns, I started to cry in the evening and I somehow managed to survive till end of the December and have two weeks off, during which I had to prepare for math exam. But still I was in Ukraine with my girlfriend. What was really killing me is, that I still can perfectly speak to my Ukrainian friends, we can argue, discuss stuff, make fun of each other etc. I have a very nice and understanding girlfriend. I have no problems socializing with them. Or even with meeting new people in Ukraine. After final exams my girlfriend was here with me in Europe, and I still could not relax. When we were in public I constantly was afraid, that I cannot protect her, due to my SA. I also failed two exams and had to retake them after holidays, which made me even more anxious. My doctor gave me some new medication, which, for two weeks seemed to lower my social anxiety and it felt awesome. I already lost my belief that there could be any meds that could really help me. And that belief was restored. The only thing I feared, is that it won\\'t hold, like with all previous things that seemed to help me. And, well, it didn\\'t hold. Something happened during the weekends, I can\\'t explain what it is. But it set me off. My fear became true. The amount of work for the University increased even more and became unbearable to me. At this point I cry for hours. Last week I spent home, constantly anxious. At this point, I don\\'t know what to do. I should have left this country for a year after school. Now I feel, like I can\\'t do it. I also feel, like I am already too old to stop studying and make a pause. I don\\'t think, that I will be able to finish this semester, since I have already fallen behind all the classes. I also get very anxious if I try to study and more anxious after every minor difficulty. My relatives think, that it wasn’t that bad previously. I think, I just was very good at suppressing it and just can\\'t take it anymore. When I felt myself worse, I was usually prescribed new medication, talked to the therapist. After that I felt a bit better and it was enough to continue suppressing and working on \"more\" important things. How long can a person live in a foreign country feeling lonely? I know, that there are people, to whom I am interesting, who like me and care about me. My family is also very supportive. But it\\'s not them, who feel anxious about going outside. It\\'s me who is constantly afraid of masses of people, who can\\'t relax outside and can\\'t protect myself from. Any verbal or nonverbal assault. It almost feels like I am at a warzone. I remember, when I didn\\'t care, how people look at me, ignored if somebody was rude to me. I was able to respond the way I wanted. My head wasn\\'t empty. Now I just slowly fall apart. I am not suicidal, I guess, because I don\\'t believe in the afterlife and am afraid of death. Hell, I even was more relaxed during this two weeks in Ukraine in winter. It wasn\\'t enough time, but I felt myself free on the streets. You probably gonna say, why the hell wouldn\\'t I leave. I know, people would support my decision, I could probably come back later. But I don\\'t won\\'t to let down my girlfriend, even if she says, I don\\'t. I didn\\'t finish a university, so nobody would really want to have me work for them and I want to work, so that I won\\'t be an abuse. I know my options. I just don\\'t have the will to make a decision. I feel like I would get better a bit, like usual and would continue ignoring the problem and maybe in 5 years will slowly finish CS at the University. I just don\\'t think, it is going to be a life. Maybe you together with my girlfriend, it would be easier. I don\\'t know, why am I even writing this. I don’t know, whether it’s a right subreddit. Even posting something on the internet makes me anxious. I do not know, what I want to hear from you. Therefore, I will just share this story and hope for something. I also hope, I won’t be deanonymized by somebody. I just feel, like for the last 8 years, I lived only episodically, not being able to open my true potential or take the opportunities, I was given. And I feel like I am slowly going insane. I hope, that this text isn\\'t totally unreadable, since I guess, English is not even my second language . I tried to keep it as short as possible, but I also don’t expect, that anybody would like to read almost 3k words text. **TL;DR** A lot of autobiographical stuff. Moving abroad as a kid literally ruined my nervous system as the years passed by. And my will was never strong enough to decide, what is really important for me and to change my life the way I really wanted.

            "{'sequence': \"('My Social Anxiety. I wrote this as a bit of a vent for myself but thought I would post it here because I’m sure many of you can relate to this. It’s a bit long but here goes... As a kid I was always “shy.” I wouldn’t make direct eye contact with people most of the time. I would put my head down in situations where I had to meet new people. At family gatherings I would mostly keep to myself only talking to people if they asked me a question. Even then, it would usually be a short response. In school I didn’t have many friends. I had more in elementary than I did in middle school. More in middle school than in high school. I can count the number of real friends I had in high school on one hand. It sure didn’t help that I went to three different high schools throughout my high school years. One of those I left and returned to a few times. I changed elementary schools in the 4th grade, and then changed middle school in the beginning of 7th grade. So it didn’t make it any easier to make friends with people that already had established groups of friends that they had grown up with. I remember hearing this girl in my class talking to her friends about how it was weird that we keep leaving and coming back. (We being my sister and I) In high school people thought I was rude or mean because I didn’t talk to anyone. The truth is I just didn’t know how. I wanted to have friends. I didn’t want to be popular or anything but who doesn’t want to have their own circle of friends and people to relate to? Even the people I “dated” didn’t get to know the real me because I was too afraid to be myself. I don’t know why I felt this way. I’m sure it has something to do with my developmental years but I’m not an expert. Going to school every day was hell. Thinking that everyone is judging you all the time or talking about you or laughing at you is rough. Being made fun of for being “too skinny” or “too quiet” or “too rude” is rough. I would walk in every morning with headphones in and make a beeline for the classroom and I would leave the same way. I wonder if you know what this social anxiety feels like? It can come and go at anytime. Some days are worse than others. Some days it’s insomnia, heart racing, palms sweating, mind racing. It’s uncontrollable and it feels like you’re mind is going to explode from the craziness inside it. Some days it lurks in the background. On those days it’s manageable. You can go to the movies or to the mall and feel somewhat okay. Some days it’s canceling plans you’ve had for weeks because you just can’t bring yourself to leave the house and face human interaction. You can’t face the feeling of everyone’s eyes on you and the negativity that you assume is associated with you. You can’t force yourself to act like you’ve got it together in front of other people. It’s too hard to put on a smile and make conversation. The hardest part for me is self doubt. I’m always second guessing what I’m doing. Always thinking someone is watching. Always afraid of messing up. It’s also people thinking I’m lazy because I don’t work and when I do it never lasts too long. Even the job I have now which is a good job with good pay, it’s hard. It’s hard forcing myself out of bed in the morning knowing for the next twelve hours I’m going to be mentally exhausted which is much worse than the physical exhaustion. That may seem like an over statement to you but it’s not for me. Walking down the long walk ways at work hoping no ones walking the opppsite direction. What do I do when I cross someone’s path? Do I make eye contact? Do I look straight ahead? Do I smile? Nod? Wave? Am I rude if I just look down or away? These are all thoughts going through my head. As irrational as they are, they’re real. What happens when everyone is standing in a group talking? Do I go and try to be part of the group? But then I have to talk to people. But if I don’t I just look like a weirdo or like I think I’m too good to talk to them. What if I think I know how to do something at work but I’m not sure and I’m afraid to mess up so I ask someone for help? Then I feel dumb because I should’ve just done what I thought was right in the first place. Sometimes I avoid doing things altogether just so I can’t fail and look dumb in front of my co workers. But doing nothing also makes me look lazy and like I’m not a team player. Do you understand the problem? This is also the reason I don’t drive. I know I’m capable of driving and would probably enjoy it, but I’m terrified of taking the driving test. I can’t bring myself to go and be on the spot like that. I don’t even want to drive in front of my fiancé so how am I supposed to do it for a test in front of a stranger? Everyone tells me you need to get your license. It’s such an obvious and easy thing for everyone else but for me it’s the hardest thing in the world. It’s the same reason I wouldn’t cut the grass when I was younger. I didn’t want people to watch me out in the front yard anyone passing by could and I didnt want to mess up and cut it poorly. I hope this will help you understand what this anxiety is like for me. It’s not getting better. In fact it’s gotten worse. I’m getting more general anxiety now. Unreasonable worrying about things I have no control over. Checking to see if my loved ones are still breathing when they sleep or worrying about getting into car accidents. Living with this anxiety is getting harder and harder. All I want to do is give up and just lay in bed at home in a safe place all the time.

However this incident has made my anxiety worse, and I\\'ve never really recovered since. When I was young, I used to always be a teacher\\'s pet. Teachers used to love me, and I was always their favorite student. I used to always get special acknowledgment from teachers because of this.

I would stare him down in the hallway or in his classroom hoping he would say something to me, but he never did. I didn\\'t like how every one else got attention from him except for me.

            "{'sequence': \"('I'm suffering with debilitating social anxiety. I feel like I'm going to spend the rest of my life living in fear.. Hello, This is going to be a little long, but please take the time to read this. I don’t know what to do. I’m not trying to gain sympathy or pity, I just need to pour my heart out. I’m 20. I’m a boy. I have social anxiety. It’s something I struggled with my whole life. In school I was always quiet because I was very shy. Students used to always ask me “Why are you so quiet?” Teachers would call my parents and tell them “Your son is very quiet.” My parents would get mad at me because of it. When we would visit family, I was always quiet and in my shell. They would ask me, “Why are you so quiet? You can open up.” I was always shy and uncomfortable around family I didn’t see very often. My father always scolded me after we visited his family for being so quiet and acting uncomfortable around them. I spent a lot of time in the house. My father never liked that. He always wanted me to go outside and play with the other kids in the neighborhood, but I never wanted to out of fear. He would always give me a hard time for always being alone and not having friends. He would say, “You’re always alone, you have no friends.” I know I don’t have any friends and I’m always alone. It was very hurtful to listen to him and hear that, but he’s right. The truth hurts. He still says it to this day. I would talk to people in school, but I would never hang out with them outside of school. I couldn’t take that next step. And people never wanted to hang out with me anyway. They would never ask me if I wanted to hang out with them. They never asked for my phone number. I could never open up to people. I was always awkward and uncomfortable with other students in school. They definitely picked up on that. I went to the same school district since third grade, and I don’t have a single friend from there. My anxiety hit rock bottom out of nowhere during my freshman year of high school. It could be attributed to the fact I was going through puberty and my hormones were raging or it just progressively got worse. I started developing so many issues that were not a problem prior. I started having a hard time making eye contact with people. Being sensitive to how people look at me. If I get dirty looks from someone or a weird look, I feel like something is wrong with me and I’m devastated. When I’m out for a walk and someone is approaching me I either put my face down and look at the ground to avoid eye contact or I try to make the effort to make eye contact with the passerby, but they just look at me funny and I feel awkward. Going out for car rides and feeling like people in other cars are looking at me and judging me. Going out for walks with other people around. People noticing that I’m nervous or uncomfortable and judging me for it. Walking into a room full of people with all eyes on me. Always feeling like people are staring at me and judging me. Just so many issues that became so severe. I always had anxiety, but during my freshman year of high school my anxiety got much worse. Prior to this, my anxiety wasn’t that bad. I was more care-free. It was easier for me to interact with people. I was able to enjoy life more. The issues I started developing weren’t much of an issue in the past. I became so upset that my anxiety gotten worse. I let my mind convince myself that I’m never going to get better. I’m doomed to have social anxiety for the rest of my life. I’m never going to be able to go back to how I was before my freshman year of high school. Going out period around other people became too anxiety inducing for me, so I became a shut-in. I went through the rest of high school with debilitating anxiety. During sophomore year, I started eating lunch in the counseling office because eating in the cafeteria with all the other students became too overwhelming for me. I always walked with a book in my hand for a comfort. I was and still am very self-conscious of the way I walk. People say I walk very stiff or like a robot. Going to school everyday made me extremely nervous. Sitting in the classroom amongst other students and feeling like everyone is staring at me. Walking the hallways. Giving presentations. High school was hell. However I made it through and I graduated. I started college and I didn’t have the college experience. I struggled with anxiety. I just stayed in my dorm all day and did nothing. I didn’t make any friends, join any clubs/organizations, party, etc. I was too afraid to open up. I was too afraid to step outside of my comfort zone and make friends and just have fun. People would try to be my friend, but I was never comfortable. Everyone around me was having the time of their lives, making friends, etc. It was depressing because I wasn’t having any of that. I don’t even want to go back to school next year. I have no life. I just sit in the house all day everyday. I don’t work because I’m too afraid to get a job. How am I going to get through the interview? What if my coworkers won’t like me? What if my manager won’t like me? What if customers or my coworkers think I’m weird because I’m socially awkward? I try to get out of the house, but being out just makes me nervous. I want to have friends and I want to have a life. I feel like I have so much to offer, I just need to get past this awful fear. I go on social media and look at people I went to school with. They are having the time of their lives while I sit on my behind and do nothing. It’s upsetting. I have no personality. I feel like a robot. Everytime I interact with people in public I’m very stiff and robotic. People tell me I’m extremely nice, but honestly I feel like I have no personality. I can’t open up to people. I’m never comfortable and I’m always on edge. I’m living in fear. I just feel like I’m doomed to have social anxiety for the rest of my life. It has gotten so severe to the point where I don’t think I can ever recover. Sorry for the long post, but I needed to pour my feelings out. I’m sick of people telling me I’m just a lazy bum. People don’t know that I’m suffering with debilitating anxiety that’s affecting my life.

I’m sick and tired of it, literally, this anxiety is physically and mentally exhausting. I wish it wasn’t a struggle to just get up in the morning, that just a simple fracking hello leaves me with hours of unease and regret that I did it wrong. Yeah, yeah, call me crazy, call me irrational, but frick, it’s real and I’ve dealt with it almost every day since I can remember. People tell me that I shouldn’t just say “I wish this” and “I wish that” and that I should just get over it or do something about it. One, frack you guys who say “just get over it”, you’ve probably never dealt with anxiety, it’s like you are carrying the weight of everyone’s judgements and eyes on you with every possibility of any and every event running through your head all the time. It’s traumatic and we live with it everyday and in the end some of us can’t take it any longer, we can’t stand the pressure of living under the umbrella of our own minds. Two, you think I’m not dealing with it? I’ve done therapy, I’ve had over half a dozen different therapists and psychologists, I’ve done the meds and meditation and I still spent over half my junior year of high school locked in my bedroom crying and trying not to end it while my mother thought I just had mono and was “tired”. I am trying, I force myself outside and to interact but it’s terrifying and people just don’t seem to get that. When you’ve lived your whole life with these voices in your head telling you that you’re useless, you’re worthless, that no one likes you or that you’ll mess everything up, it’s hard to just shut it out. They echo all the time; you want to go out for ice cream, they’ll tell you people will think your ice cream choice is weird or you’ll drop the cone all over you or on someone else. Rinse wash and repeat with any and every social situation. Yeah I’m getting better, I’m moving forward. I haven’t ended it, but frack man, it just takes one bad look, one simple “freak” or “weirdo” uttered under someone’s breath that sends me spiraling right back down to that dark place. So yeah, I wish I could just not give a frack about what people think or say but I can’t. I’m still a work in progress and at the moment that’s all I have to give.

I was severely bullied through my late elementary school-early middle school years. Developed depression, anxiety, eating issues, and general body dysmorphia. All of these issues I still struggle with today. However, the most severe out of them is my anxiety. I worry over everything; no matter how big or small. The most insignificant thing can send me off in a fit of nerves and panic. I’m plagued with what ifs constantly. I’ve avoided social events because of anxiety. Most of my daily life is fucked up due to anxiety. My anxiety stems from the root of being afraid of messing up. As a kid, I taught myself to be a perfectionist; if I did everything perfectly I wouldn’t get in trouble. If I did everything right and was perfect inside and out, then my parents and friends and family wouldn’t have to worry about me. This has had a disastrous effect. I can’t go outside due to being so nervous of fucking up, doing something stupid, looking dumb, etc. I’ll get this knot in my stomach just thinking about going out with friends. I can’t talk to new/ somewhat familiar people because I get nervous that I’m not talking right or looking stupid or saying the wrong thing or just being overall disinteresting. Anything outside of my daily routine of work/school/home fucks me up. This also relates to new experiences. I’m scared of dating. I’m scared of sex. Whenever I think about these things I get this extreme burning sensation, a heavy fit of nerves, and I have to calm myself down because it gets so intense. I hate going on vacations because I get the what if’s and at the end of the day I just count down to the day I can be back in the safety of my own home. It’s killing me. I hate myself at the fact I can’t do regular things. I don’t have fun. My life is so mundane and basic that it frustrates me, but the anxiety and fear of the outside is what keeps me isolated. I can’t go places. I can’t talk to people. I can’t make new friends. I can’t live my life. I can’t take it anymore. It’s not even the fact that I won’t do it, I physically cannot do it.

This is unique, in that suffering from a mental disorder such as OCD or depression doesn’t necessarily restrict you seeking help in the sense of being unable to get yourself, on your own, to see a doctor or a therapist. However, you have to want to get better. You have to know that you deserve better, that social anxiety is NOT normal, is NOT something anyone should suffer with, and that it IS a strongly researched mental health disorder which is legitimate and known by every health professional. You need to enforce this desire, and you have to make a doctors appointment. This will create a dialogue with your GP. You have to see what support is there for you. Your GP speaks to hundreds of people every week, with a whole host of different issues, both physical and mental. Mental health is a massive public health issue and is finally being treated as such. SEE. YOUR. DOCTOR! Doing this was the best thing I ever did, even though I was terrified when I had my first appointment. I am not ashamed to admit that I had some alcohol before going, thought about cancelling in the week leading up to the appointment and was just downright terrified of going. But I did, I said that I had anxiety, in social situations, and guess what - he understood. Doctors. Don’t. Judge. I was put on a small dose of medication - was a bit weird for the first few days, as it made me lose my appetite and feel a bit weird, but it settled. You don’t notice the affects of anxiety medication too much, it takes about 6 weeks for it to have any affect. It’s likely you’ll also have your dose increased after your body settles on it. It can feel like a long process, you just want to stop having these feelings of anxiety, of dread, of fear going somewhere and having the physical symptoms of your anxiety presenting themselves and embarrassing you. But it’s just the first step to getting better - medication CAN work. Some say it doesn’t work for them, but it definitely makes some difference for some, and I am living proof of that. Next - therapy. I wouldn’t have been able to do a single therapy session if it weren’t for medication. Some will be able to, and if you are, great. Secondly, money. I live in the UK, and here the NHS offer therapy for free if the patient needs it, so I’m lucky in that sense, although the waiting list was 3 months. I am aware that in many countries, therapy isn’t cheap. However, even where money is tight, please realise that your mental state is so important, and is ABSOLUTELY worth spending money on in looking to improve it. Social anxiety is not normal, and is not something you should have to be subject to every day. You deserve to get professional help. For those who literally cannot afford therapy, I sincerely apologise and ask you to see if there is anything you can do to get the help you need. Therapy is scary, at first. But it’s also the best thing I’ve forced myself to do. You become familiar and comfortable with a therapist. They understand social anxiety, they put you at ease and remind you that this is their JOB, and that they deal with patients with social anxiety EVERY SINGLE DAY. These are things you can do, that WILL make an improvement to your social anxiety. It will make your quality of life better, and it is absolutely worth doing. You only get one life on this earth, don’t live yours in the shackles of social anxiety because you deserve better.

A friend of mine never responds anyway so I\\'ve stopped trying, even though I would love to keep up the friendship. My old friends from high school never messaged me first so I convinced myself that I upset them, so we eventually lost touch.

Hi, I’m 13 male and i like to play street basketball with friends, play soccer and play basketball on my school team. So anyways i have something that is still really bothering me that happened 2 days ago. I was hanging out with my friend after school and his name is Dylan. We were wanting to get a street basketball game going so we called a bunch of guys and planned on playing in a hour. We had 8 guys interested. My brother was also interested and wanted to play so we said he could play. Then my mom said little later. I have a doctor appointment booked for you in 30 minutes and you have to go before you can play with your friends. She suggested all 4 of us (me, my bro, dylan) drive together to my doctor appointment and then she would drive us to the game. I said ok and quickly ran upstairs to my bedroom and put on my basketball jersey with shorts on. Then i said i’m ready to go. So we all drove to the doctors. Once we were there we didn’t have to wait long because it was booked already and the nurse comes to the waiting room and calls my name. I get up and saw my bro and dylan still sitting. I told them they could come too if they want. My mom then said are you sure because your your going to get a physical exam done. I didn’t know what that was and thought it meant was going to be showing how physical fast and strong i am. So they know im not weak for my age. So i told them yeah i don’t mind them coming in. So we got in the doctors room and we are waiting for 5 minutes and the doctor walks in. He says hi to me and my mom and then notices my friend and brother sitting in the room too. He then said are you sure you want your brother or friend in here when we do your physical exam? I said i don’t mind. Still not know what that really means. The doctor then said ok can you sit on the bed and take off your jersey? so checked my heartbeat and measured my waist. Then said ok can you remove your shorts. I was wondering why he was telling me to do this and was little embarrassed taking my shorts off in front of my brother and friend because both of them have never saw my in my underwear before or naked. Besides when i was 5 years old having a bath with my brother was the last time. So i take off my shorts and he told me to lay on the bed. So i did and pushing my tummy and using this triangle thing on my knee that makes my knee jump. He then told me he needs to check my bowels so told me to lay on my side facing away from everyone. He then lowers my underwear and my butt is now showing to everyone and i was so embarrassed! i could hear my bro and dylan giggling a bit. So then the doctor uncomfortably puts his finger in me and kinda hurt and then it was done and got me to stand up. I felt really embarrassed already and noticed my friend holding his phone and smiling. He had his phone down so i don’t know if he took a video or picture of me. Then the doctor said Can you please remove your underwear?! I was so nervous and felt anxiety coming in and looked at my bro and dylan who looked really excited. So i took off my underwear and covered myself and the doctor said put your hands on your sides. I could hear my bro and friend giggling but didn’t want to look at them. The doctor then checked everything including my frontal area for 5 minutes and also told me to turn around. Once everything was done and we left the doctors i felt so embarrassed! I didn’t want to talk to anyone. It was nobody’s fault but mine because my mom and the doctor both warned me and i didn’t know what a physical exam is. I can’t blame them. So my mom dropped us off at the basketball game but i really didn’t want to play cause i was having social anxiety and i sat off to the side.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'I\\'m near your age and have had two jobs thus far. My social anxiety is very crippling, but I realize I need money to make my life better in the long run (i.e college funds, rent, etc). So here are some personal tips: nn1. Volunteer. Local pet shelters are great for this as they accept everyone who is willing and not a crazy psycho trying to skin cats. This will introduce you to the social environment of work, and if you volunteer at a pet shelter you will have animals to calm you during the stressful moments. Plus you can literally decide to go whenever you want. For me I go once a week for an hour or two and I even lead shifts now. It helps.nn2. Apply for quiet places. Like a fabrics store or garden center. Something very mello will help your anxiety. My first job was at Walmart in the produce section. The worst you\\'ll have to deal with is someone asking you where the oranges are while standing in front of them. You don\\'t have to work at McDonald\\'s boo, you can be a recluse and water plants for 6 hours a day.nn3. You have phone anxiety like me, so don\\'t pick up! Let them leave a voicemail. I got so many calls when applying for my first jobs and never once answered the first time. They would leave a voicemail and I would promptly call back within 2 hours to a day and give some believable excuse as to why I couldn\\'t answer such as I was in school, on the road, personal issue, bad cell service, etc. They\\'d always be happy to hear back and I would schedule interviews that way. Once you have an interview, save their number and wait for a call back and pick up if you can that time.nn4. Practice practice practice! Write down possible questions and answers to them. Go over them outloud. Take phone calls in a quiet or calm place. Practice common interview questions and prepare to be nervous.nn5. Set your hours low at first and work later or in the mornings. Go for about 18 to 20 a week and work from there. Do NOT, I REPEAT, DON\\'T set hours you\\'ll hate out of desperation that they will only want you if your availability is from 8am to 10pm Monday to Sunday. Also, pick late or early shifts. I.e pick shifts after people go to work for the day to before they get off (9am to 3pm) or after they are usually at home or asleep (9pm to early am for me personally). This is a great time to work at a store like Walmart, Target, etc. The most customers you\\'ll face are nurses or old women who are looking for plants in the meat asile. Get to know your city\\'s schedule and schedule yourself for times when the mass of people are typically busy or elsewhere. 24 hour stores are usually in need of people for these shifts.nn6. Finally, tell them you have anxiety. I have had two jobs, but have been offered over five and have applied to about 15 places. All of which, if I was interviewed, I explained my social anxiety. Employers nowadays are a bit more sensitive to this. You can say \"I have very bad social anxiety, and would prefer doing things mostly in the back or away from people until I am used to the work environment to prevent any problems from arising.\" They\\'ll usually say \"well we will train you to do x thing, but if it takes some time we\\'ll work with you.\" That\\'s when you know they\\'re interested. Don\\'t hide your anxiety to someone who can affect your future employability. My current boss and assistant manager both know how bad I suffer and often coddle me when they see it affecting my work performance. My fellow employees, though I am not friends with them, also understand this and will help me. I work in a pizza place and I take orders on register, give out food, and answer phones. When I need to step away I ask someone to take over and they will. Getting overwhelmed isn\\'t bad, just take a second to step back.nnSome other general tips to remember: Always apply for jobs you\\'ll like FIRST, wait a few days, and then apply for jobs you can deal with theoretically. Try to really go for jobs that match your interests as it\\'ll be easier to adjust to.nnIf you get denied, don\\'t freak. I did this before and it does nothing but take away all your hard work. An interview will happen again.nnI hope I helped.\\')', 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with positive effect', 'outdoor activity or space with negative effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect'], 'scores': [0.36884137988090515, 0.3334348797798157, 0.2977237403392792]}\n",

Ask yourself what your dream job would be. Then do research about what you should be doing to to get closer to having that job. If having a university education improves your chances of fulfilling your dreams, then go for university. Once you have figured whether you want to study or immediately start working, it's time to take the necessary steps to achieve your goal. Research universities you want to apply for, research employers you want to work for. Then rank them according to how attractive they seem, this will significantly reduce anxiety, as even if you don't get your first option you will likely have dozens of good alternatives on your list. You said your grades were good, so someone is very likely to accept you. nnThen try to figure out what each institution/workplace requires from you. Start writing your CV, your letter of motivation or whatever else they might need. You still have until summer before you graduate, and if you spend half an hour per day on these things the time will add up.nnRegarding your social anxiety there are many techniques you can use to reduce or remove it completely, but it does require some work. A good first step is always to ask yourself what gives you the most anxiety. Is it public speaking? Is it conversations? Based on your story it sounds like you have anxiety about meeting new people (a fear I know all too well). The best solution to this is, of course, to keep meeting new people. Find out about social activities you can do in your town or neighbourhood is there a sports-club, movie-club, hiking group, debating society? Another advice is to build a social anxiety ladder, where you will rank your anxieties from least to most anxiety provoking. Then work yourself up this list. Start by exposing yourself to situation that only makes your slightly anxious, once you feel that you can handle these more easily, start on the next item on the list.nnAlso, I need to add that just because you feel anxious around the people in your class doesn't mean that you will feel anxious around other people in the future.

For various reasons, a few of those friends, have grown closer to each other, and they are closer to each other than they are to me, although we still go out for drinks, bbq, have movie nights, and have fun every week, or every other week. Their social networks are also much broader than mine, because their careers all require extensive networking. I have also made different groups of friends since college, but not to the same degree as them. I know I feature less prominently in their lives than they do in mine at this point, and it’s not personal. We still have a good time, and just because things change doesn’t invalidate the friendship we do still enjoy. And when it comes to planning any kind of party, they are definitely my favorite friends to go out for a crazy night or a drink with. All of this is fine, until it comes to my birthday. My birthday falls on Labor Day weekend. Last year most of my college friends took advantage of Labor Day weekend to go on a trip to a cabin and have fun together. The person coordinating the event (whose parents own the cabin) obviously chose who would go (only a limited number of people were allowed to come with his parents’ permission). While this same person is a friend of mine, I was not a close enough friend to make the cut to be invited on the trip. Those invited on the trip, however, included most of my friends from college. This forced me to push my birthday party to a different weekend, as I still wanted my old college friends at my birthday party (I didn’t have as many other friends yet that year). But it really made me feel pathetic to plan my birthday around people who had decided I was not important enough to include on a trip the same weekend as my birthday. From what I understand, this same group is going on a trip this Labor Day weekend—once again on my birthday. Obviously a lot of people travel on the 3 day weekend, and I’m not a narcissist who expects no one to travel just cause it’s my birthday. I am also mature enough to not be overly offended if some of my friends plan trips without including me sometimes. But it really hurts me that my college friends all have a yearly tradition to go on a trip I’m not invited on every year the same weekend as my birthday. I know we all are going our separate ways, and I know I am making too much of a deal of my birthday, but birthdays are miserable reminders of life passing by for most people after a certain age, so I feel extra vulnerable around mine, and this is a bit of a punch to the gut for the past 2 years. I don’t want to be childish and tell them not to use the 3 day weekend (that would be dumb and selfish), I don’t want to force myself onto the trip (also dumb and childish), and I don’t want to cut out friendships over something that I don’t think is meant to be personal, when these friendships are mostly rewarding throughout the rest of the year. If someone could gently help me put this into perspective, or how to make me feel less in pain about this. However I celebrate on my birthday, I know I would feel the absence of those friends, and I don’t want to plan some elaborate trip in response—that’s just petty and wouldn’t actually help me stop being petty and hurt over this. I was also thinking about going on a backpacking trip alone so I can get some time to myself, because I don’t like how my relationships with other people are affecting my sense of self worth. That’s not how I want to live my life, and maybe I need to become more independent, and I am tired of having all this stress and pageantry around my birthday. I just know that I will likely be feeling bad because of this on my birthday (I know this is immature, and I need to work past this), and I’m afraid this will be in my thoughts no matter what I do.

I hope that others that are suffering with Social Anxiety can not only relate, but can also see a path to success. It started in 4th or 5th grade or so and continued to get at its worst in 6th grade. In 6th grade, I would avoid social situations, I wouldn’t talk to most people around me and I was always known as the “quite kid”. I wouldn’t even talk to my own family.. I completely isolated myself from everyone except a couple of friends that I made in the previous years. But sometimes, I would isolate myself from them as well. I felt different, like everyone else was normal and I wasn’t. I did not understand how to talk to people, how to laugh, how to be around others without being judged. This was an all time low for me. So how did I go from an all time low in 6th grade to overcoming SAD? Well obviously this didn’t happen over night. Lets fast forward to freshman year in high school. At this point, I am not as bad as I was in 6th grade. I was able to make a few friends in middle school around 8th grade, but most of them did not go to my high school, only two of them. But despite having friends, I was still very quite. I kept to myself, constantly just on my phone. At lunch, I really didn’t have anybody to talk to most of the time. And every time somebody tried to talk to me, I just did not know how to communicate with them, I completely shutdown and I was just basically screaming in my head please just go away! So did I ever make any new friends? Not really. I avoided social situations, I kept to myself. Another reason why I did this, is because every time I got nervous taking to someone, my face would get really hot and I turn red very fast, this led me to avoid every single social interaction that I possibly could avoid because of the fear of blushing from how nervous I got. So that’s most of my struggles with this, I need to speed things up because this is turning into a book.. I got a job as a snowboard instructor (still freshman year in high school) and I had to teach groups of kids and sometimes adults how to snowboard. As someone who was very antisocial and a clear case of SAD, this was not easy. But while it was difficult at first, it actually wasn’t that hard. I didn’t need to make small talk with the kids, all I needed to do was to talk about snowboarding and show them how to do it. I had a step by step plan and I knew exactly what I was going to say. This was the first step for me to learn how to communicate with people like a normal human being. I did this for 4 years all through high school. This job helped significantly to force me to stop avoiding situations and to face my fear of social interactions and judgment The next step was college. The first class I took was a communications class, this forced me to speak in front of people every week. This class was proof that even though my speeches sucked, I could stand in front of people and not panic. I proved to my self that despite my SAD, I can do this. This class was truly the pinnacle of overcoming SAD. This class (Mindful Communication) tested how far I have come. I went from complete isolation from people and complete avoidance of all social situations, to standing in front of a college class of 25 people, which were all judging every word I said. I don’t think it’s this class that is what helped me so much.. but it was just the test to show that I can do this. What helped me so much was a combination of things. But I think the biggest help my was my experience as a snowboard instructor. It forced me to communicate with parents, kids, and other snowboard instructors. Putting yourself in the situation that you don’t want to be in is the best way to learn to cope with social anxiety. This is what worked for me, I’m not saying you all need to become snowboard instructors, but find something that will force you to communicate with people that you also enjoy doing. It’s not easy, but this is what it takes. So am I cured? No not completely. But I do not let social Anxiety run my life like it use to. I control my anxiety and I learned to cope with it. I do not avoid social situations like I use to, and I no not get super nervous when talking to people. I have a much better relationship with my family, and I now work as a software developer. I am 23 years old, and I have overcome SAD. I still have some social Anxiety, but it is not a disorder and it’s significantly improved. I hope my story is able to help somebody out there.

I said sure, and walked over. I met like 10 people at the party. They were all really nice and chill, asked about my dog, what I did for work. I had a beer.

I was honestly so incoherent and I couldn’t keep up with conversation any more lol.

I knew he had 3 kids, and I felt such anxiety thinking that he just knew I was so fucking high that he only asked for my number to make sure I was okay. I said “nah I’m good” and they said “yeah you’re a big girl”. I’m 25 and they looked like they were early to mid 30s. I look like I’m in high school though and a couple of them did ask me if I was old enough to drink. So I’m so self conscious that i think they think I’m just a fucking twat.

            "{'sequence': '(\\' Social Anxiety: The Essentials. After looking around, I felt that sharing my story may help others. And in some way make all the pointless suffering mean something if it helps or resonates with one person. Preface: I am a 24-year-old college grad whos spent countless years languishing in deep thought/fear/pain about their own behaviors and emotions. Probably have had more internal conversations than external ones. Crushed at times under the carousel of depression/self-loathing. Other times crippled so badly by fears of judgments that basic human tasks become sources of complete life-threatening terror. This becomes further compounded when those \"loved ones\" around you gladly and publicly point out your fears as if exposing you will somehow make you stronger. All of this and more! As I share my failures, my victories, and continuous battle with social anxiety. &amp;#x200B; The best way to tell this story is perhaps through pain points of the past, present,(and even future). So I will just dive in no particular order. &amp;#x200B; The Phone Who knew a modern wonder of tech that is supposed to connect us could also be the source of such bone-numbing fear. I think it all started back in 1st grade. A girl gave me her phone number (remember I am like 7). After school I called, and we engaged in the most 7-year-old conversation ever. So basically a conversation about nothing. Afterward, I found out that my Mom and Brother had picked up the downstairs phone and listened to the whole thing. They then for weeks afterward mocked me and repeated what I said on the phone. Talk about traumas to an undefined child. It\\'s events such as those that drive you to form opinions about yourself and make an early association with fear and speaking on the phone. Fast forward and think of all the times (starting from age 7) you have had to speak on the phone. Now imagine each time the thought of using a phone is so horrible it turns your stomach over. Social anxiety in a nutshell. I\\'ve found that with time receiving a phone call was the easier evil. Somehow it being unexpected and someone else initiating the conversation took the edge off it. Having lived into adulthood, phone calls are inevitable so you eventually (through exposure) adapt and develop a tolerance for them. Yet even so to this day placing a phone call to someone is still sometimes a shaky voice and sweaty palm event, particularly when its phone interview. I have one coming up in a few days and dread the idea of literally taking a phone call to be judged by someone. And don\\'t even get me started on making or taking a call in a quiet office space. Advice: Slowly Expose yourself (naturally through time or forcibly by need) to phone interactions. Next time you order food try calling instead of making your mom do it/using an app. Make a doctor\\'s appointment. Usually calling places that handle constant phone calls ( docs/food/customer service) are the easiest to make because you know what you need to say and the person usually is going off a script. It\\'s scary (trust me), but you can work up to it. I avoided using the phone until it became ridiculous for my age and just faced it through trial and error. &amp;#x200B; The Checkout Experience For the LONGEST time growing up this was another point of contact for me and my social anxiety. Having to go alone to a counter and ask/buy something. I really honed my avoidance maneuvers. Giving money to friends to buy my ticket. Walking together up to the counter with someone and throwing my order on theirs so at least I wasn\\'t alone doing it. Or just flat out avoided buying things or asking for help. It\\'s so ingrained in me that I walk into places today and am still so determined to figure out things for myself and not ask employees/help desks for information. Just the thought of having to do it/entering a situation where you know its coming would fill me with red hot anxiety. Like I could run away on the spot. This one really holds you back in life. Today I am more accustomed to it. I worked in retail behind the counter for 4-5 years through college. (that was it\\'s own personal hell). But I kinda reduced the fear a lot over time. I went to go buy a cable recently from an electronic store. I couldn\\'t find it anywhere. Eventually, I approached a worker and said \"Where are the ethernet cables\". He looked so confused and said \"WHAT?\". The worst thing to hear with as someone with anxiety. In a split second you feel nervous, ask yourself \"What did I say wrong? Is this guy going to yell at me?\" Turning inwards and feeling all insecurities explode out into your focus. I said again more loudly \"ETHERNET cables\", and he turned and showed me where they where. Little moments like this, I imagine other people don\\'t remember or acknowledge the way I do. The fact that something so small and unimportant stuck with me for me to be able to write about shows how impactful anxiety is on you. The fixation on past \"failures\" or \"awkward moments\". Yet logic tells me that It\\'s unlikely the worker in that story noticed or cared about my behavior and certainly did not judge me at that moment. If he did, why does it matter so much? These are the sometimes underlying thoughts one must grapple with. The emotions V.S rational thoughts. You feel things that are unpleasant caused by common situations and don\\'t understand/get angry with yourself over those feelings. Then you tell yourself what other people think doesn\\'t matter, then go back to feeling those emotions again. My advice: This one is more tricky because as long as your polite and to the point you can minimize how much you actually have to speak to someone behind the counter. And often if you come into a place prepared you don\\'t have to interact at all (Digital tickets/know where you\\'re going). If this is something you want to overcome, try ordering food in person at McDonald\\'s. (Probably where I first started practicing unknowingly). It\\'s simpler because your just reading from the menu and someone can stand near you if you need it. If you\\'re like me choose one that\\'s not so busy, sometimes the energy of a big crowd can overwhelm your senses. I think remembering the person your speaking to is usually trying to do their job or just answer your question or help you can ease the nerves. &amp;#x200B; The kids \"going through changes\" Not here to repeat any cliches about puberty. Just to note how much more difficult it is to adapt to changes when you\\'re socially anxious. My mom would always say \"you\\'re going through the CHANGE\". I grew leg hair early and it was a lot. It was something my mom especially would comment on. She/ other family would ALWAYS highlight imperfections or changes they noticed on my body. Leg hair, arm hair, acne, height, weight, posture. It\\'s hard enough braving middle school with asshole peers but your own fam making you feel inadequate through teasing is hard. I started just covering everything. Wore long pants all summer, stated avoiding the pool, or exposing too much. Essentially lived like a victorian woman in 1890\\'s. I was so uncomfortable with showing my legs or anything I felt was \"not normal\" I would rather sweat and boil in summer heat then show off my body. This lasted through to high school. Eventually with time It stopped being such a big deal to me. I can only describe it as one day, you wake up, and feel no emotions(or fewer emotions) triggered at the thought of doing the act. So then you just wear shorts. Or show off your body more. Today I am mainly uncomfortable about my weight. I still feel embarrassed about taking my shirt off. I rationally acknowledge that I don\\'t think I\\'m actually as overweight as I think I am and people probably don\\'t see me as fat as I see me. I CAN take my shirt off, but I avoid going to the beach or pools because I compare myself to other more fit people, and feel so unhappy with how I look. This may sound all cliche, but anxiety really takes these things and cranks the dial up to 11. It really impacts your ability to function and changes so much about how you act/what you do/where you go. Advice: This one I\\'m still working on. I think it\\'s an uphill battle (than can be won) if you change how you think. Maturity helps a lot. Getting older and leaving behind all those teenage ideals about judgments. And judging yourself less harshly. I think that\\'s a key to a lot of this. Remember that nobody externally can COME CLOSE to judging as nastily and self-degradingly as yourself. Other people don\\'t experience your day from begging to end. Only you live with all of your memories, behavior, experiences. And therefore the only thing in your control is to slowly change how you react and feel about them. I often say to myself \"be kind to yourself\". It sounds like something you see on a motivational poster in an elementary school hallway. But it\\'s truly worth working on. I think if you stop judging yourself and holding yourself to unrealistic standards of \"perfection\", you can start working on overcoming challenges and having small victories. I saw the path to overcoming anxiety as a straight line with total victory as the goal. But this is not a pass/fail experience! Every phone call, every conversation, I got a little better. You just gotta keep focusing on the victories. (This one sounded preachy but it\\'s my truth.) One thing I heard was this: Imagine your traveling along the same road each day. The road is full of potholes. You keep walking along and without fail always fall into the potholes. For years you keep traveling the same road and keep falling in the potholes. Eventually, your become a little more alert and move out of the way of one pothole. You avoided it. The next day you fall back into the same pothole. This cycle repeats. Yet over time there are changes. Sometimes you avoid potholes. The time it takes for you to pull yourself out of the potholes is shortened. (not doing the analogy justice but you get the point) I felt like this resonated with my life a little. It taught me that overcoming social anxiety is about the progress you make each day and not about achieving some goal of perfection or \"being more normal\". Take a moment and consider how different you are from 1 year ago, and then 5 years ago? I used to be so crippled by anxiety I basically couldn\\'t do anything. Yet somehow I graduated college, survived solo presentation and group projects, worked a retail job, then worked in an office. So if you really want to change, start small and don\\'t give up. The past few days I\\'ve been really anxious and depressed on and off. So it\\'s still something I carry with me. But I\\'m still here pushing and fighting.

Every day that I'm there, I sit alone, trying to get my work done but for some reason I feel like absolute shit every second of every day spent there. I can't nearly begin to explain how it feels, the best I can describe it is as a physical heaviness on my chest, different from my normal anxiety. Even just thinking back to the feelings is enough to send me into panic. I mentioned at the beginning of this post that I deal with extreme highs and lows, and what I mean by this is that I have two bigger moods in my daily life, (high and low) and then I have normal mood me which for a while I didn't think existed but following therapy I have discovered that that middle mood is there. When I'm experiencing a high, it's almost as if I switch into a completely different person, like an extrovert. I start cracking jokes in front of people, I participate in all conversations, I feel confident and on top of the world, I feel restless and hyperactive. Having a high is completely random, there's no triggers that I've noticed. I also haven't noticed any triggers for my lows. When I'm low, I feel worthless; sad; emotional; silent; slow; unproductive and I get urges to either SH or kill myself. When I'm out of a low, it's hard to look back and remember in detail what happened, as if it's misted up in my brain like an old memory. When I was younger I was extremely depressed, and I SH and attempted suicide many times, so maybe this is a factor in the sudden urge to harm myself when I'm low as a reaction to negativity? I'm not sure. My 'normal mood' is me feeling calm with not much anxiety and no negative thinking, which to me feels like a happy mood compared to what I experience during a low. Back to my situation - when I'm at college and I experience these lows, there's nothing I can do to handle it, I can't just go to bed and sleep to escape it, or wrap up in a warm blanket and avoid all social interaction. I have to sit in a studio with thirty other people, feeling like that, and often times it leads to meltdowns or panic attacks. I have tried listening to music; fiddling with fidget toys; going for a walk outside; watching netflix; talking to lecturers about it; focusing on work; taking a break from my work and doing different art; drinking water; breathing exercises; sitting in the bathrooms; texting my partner; planning shopping lists. None of these coping mechanisms work. One thing I have noticed is that I either have a low, panic attacks or I get that physical sad heaviness on my chest that feels suffocating every single day at college, which I think has created a fear around attending the course due to having no escape from these emotions and feelings. I've only had a high at college about four or five times. I do remember a time at the beginning of the course where I didn't feel the suffocating heaviness, just the casual anxiety around people. I used to have friends on this course, we were a group of five but this year they've expanded the friendship group, which is all the people on the course. Socialising with four other people was enough for me to come home exhausted and needing to recharge, but I can't handle socialising with a group of 30 odd people. Since then, I've isolated myself from the group - not that the original group have really tried to involve me in the new group. Another thing to add is that I've never been able to maintain a friendship for longer than a year, my boyfriend of almost two years is the longest relationship of any sort I've had. Is this just me, or does anyone else have the same issue? I went on holiday with my boyfriend and parents for three days last week and my god, I felt free. I did feel anxiety and some strong emotions but they felt reasonable because I was in busy environments like a swimming pool or a restaurant. This was great news to me because I thought, hey, this is what life can be like. Then I came home. Hell broke loose within me. I couldn't get myself out of bed to go to college, I haven't been there in almost a week and my attendance is poor enough as it is. I can't work up the energy to shower. I don't feel hungry. I can't even get up to brush my teeth. I don't even want to do art, I've tried, it gives me too much time to think. I've tried sleeping it off, but then the next day comes too quickly and I have to rinse repeat. I'm having about four or five panic attacks a day and a night. I'm keeping my boyfriend awake because we're both scared that I will end up in a mindset where I can't take it anymore and I give up. I can't think about the future without melting down. It's mental and physical hell. I thought it was because of college that I feel this way, that I've had a taste of freedom and I've realised that college isn't it for me. But I'm not sure that's it. I was going to drop out, frustrated and disappointed in myself that I can't make it another eight months to get my art diploma but was confident that I'd be taking a step towards healing my mental health. Then came the bad news, my mum told me that if I drop out then I need to get a job to pay rent because she can't afford to keep me here if she doesn't get government benefits for me. My boyfriend (19M and a full time worker) lives with us, and we're currently sleeping in my parents front room in the side of the house. We've already been told that if we don't move out soon they'll kick us out. We've been looking for places to rent but nobody considers us because we're so young. This has only worsened my anxiety, and I know that I probably seem quite pathetic because I'm scared of working but it isn't just that, I've worked before and I got fired for having panic attacks. It isn't just an unreasonable fear anymore, it's my worst fear at a job come true. So, my choices are: 1. Drop out of college to save my mental health but be forced to find a job and pay rent which will only worsen my mental health anyway, leading me down a path of feeling suicidal for a period of time and then attempting suicide. I've been down that mental path before too many times and I don't want to die so this choice doesn't seem like a good one for me. 2. Continue college for the last eight months, continue feeling this mental hell that I so badly wanted to escape. Get my diploma, be forced to get a job when the course ends anyway. Go back down on the same path of mental health and feeling suicidal. Again, I don't want to die. This is where I'm stuck. Both paths worsen my mental health which I don't want. And I appreciate that not many people enjoy school or working, but to me this isn't just about lack of enjoyment, it's as if there is something in my body that physically stops me from doing it. You know when you have two magnets that are facing the wrong way so you physically cannot connect the two? There's always that distance as you try your best to grip them in your hands and force them together. That's what I experience in my chest, and it's not just an emotion, it's as if there is actually a magnet in my chest. Like, no matter how hard I try to just push through and do these things like jobs or courses, there's a force that won't let me. Believe me, I'm frustrated at myself too for being such a failure. And to address the paths of feeling suicidal, I'm not talking about it like that to be dramatic, I mean it in a way that it's my life pattern and I can't fix it, no matter what I try. My mental health deteriorates, I keep going through it and try my best to get through to the light at the end of the tunnel, but it gets too much, too many lows, too many bad thoughts, too much for me to take. I either take myself to hospital, or I attempt suicide. And it's easy to just say well why don't you push harder, try for longer. I've tried, either way I end up in the hospital waiting room. I've attempted three times this year, the last was this Summer, where I was in the waiting room with my boyfriend from 9:45pm until 11am the next day after being promised a bed on a ward. I was discharged within an hour of being seen. Having been so many times with no help or answers as to why I'm like this, going to hospital isn't an option anymore because obviously there's nothing they can do for me. It hurts so bad that there's nothing I can do to make this better or to make this go away, I don't want to die and leave all my pain to my boyfriend, but I want to not exist anymore, it seems like the only option I have that isn't months and months of torture followed by attempting suicide as a result of it all anyway. My boyfriend is an angel, he didn't sign up for this when he met me and I feel like such a burden on him, but he insists that he'll always be there for me and he compares it to when I was his rock when he was depressed and anxious but he was strong enough to not give up, unlike me. Is this just bad social anxiety? Or is there something wrong with me? Does anyone else feel like this? I hope this made some sort of sense to somebody out there. TLDR; I have two options of continuing college or getting a job, but both feel physically impossible due to anxiety and bad mental health. I fear both paths will lead to me killing myself.

So I finally got some and went to try them out this evening. I went down to the parking lot of my apartment building, got on my feet realizing that I may have forgotten how to roller blade and slowly make my way down the sidewalk. As I’m rolling, I hear a man in the parking lot say, “I see you rollerblades!” Immediately loosing focus I veer off to the rocks almost breaking my face. The guy calls out asking if I need help and I say no thank you. He continues to offer assistance saying how he doesn’t want me to fall and I realize I can’t run away because I’ve got the dang roller blades on. I fall again and he and his two friend come towards to offer help me around the corner but I say no thank you but I’m just practicing. The original guy still offering help starts kind of flirting saying how he’s the type of guy to make sure I don’t fall. I make my way away and fall behind a bush, I take off my roller blades, walk up the back stairs so that they can’t see where I am going and go back to my apartment. I was probably outside for a total of 5 minutes. The moment the guy spoke to me I wanted to run. Now he and his friends weren’t creepy about it they legit saw me struggling and didn’t want me to demolish my face. And the guy who offered to help in the first place was actually pretty cute. I really hate how my anxiety kept me from trying more on my roller blades, which I’ve been wanting to do but also made me miss out on interacting with some seemingly nice people in my neighborhood. I just can’t figure out how to overcome the urge to run away from any interaction.')\", 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with negative effect', 'outdoor activity or space with positive effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect'], 'scores': [0.594100296497345, 0.28993913531303406, 0.11596055328845978]}\n"

Don\\'t feel like you need someone, or need to be with someone. Instead, for now try to work on your emotional state and stability.

So I did nothing. Then during my last year of school due to the lack of any social life and stuff I decided I had to do at least something meaningful in my life (playing games, programming and watching minute physics all day didn\\'t satisfy anymore, it didn\\'t serve any purpose). Then I started running, every day in the evening though the fields, where no one could see and bother me. I think I started with 1km, really slow, and I truly hate running. And i was really bad at it. But at least at the end of the Day I had the feeling that I\\'d done at least one thing that served a purpose on that day. I got better at it, started running longer rounds and faster, I used one of these running tracking apps, they motivate A LOT! Even started to enjoy it sometimes a bit. At the same time I started running I cut back my food intake (in retrospective I ate way too less then I should have). Both these things where just hard on a physical level - I was a) hungry and b) running is hard work. BUT you\\'re not working against your fears in that case, so it\\'s doable! Fast forward some months later, I was still going on a run every day, and I partially hated it. But I got better, I lost weight, and for the first time in my life I ran 5km.

Since I started college after that I thought \"why not join a gym, I want to build up muscles\" and from there on I went at least 3 times / day, and I love it!

I can say it is not as severe as having to drop out of school but it was pretty close to it. A few things I can tell you: 1) Mindfulness. Something I SHOULD practice more of.. but mindfulness is a form of meditation to help bring your mind out of the constant state of thinking (i.e. about if others are judging me) and brings you to a complete focused state. Look up mindfulness audio sessions or something like that on google, there is plenty of tutorials and things to help. 2) \"Don\\'t break the chain\" ..its something the famous comedian Jerry Sienfeld talked about. This is a comedian who has done so many stand up routines that it seemed so unlikely he was able to write that many jokes! How does he do so many one hour specials?! He mentioned it was something he calls \"dont break the chain,\" or in other words he would write a joke every single day, good or not, but do so EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. The reason I say this is because you should find something to work on every single day, no matter what! I myself joined a gym about a year and a half ago.. it was not because I wanted to lose weight (though that was on my mind as well) but because I needed some constant factor in my life that I would put forth effort each day to complete, something I HAD to do, to keep my mind on it.. You should find something to do, even if it\\'s just drawing a small picture or running a mile.. do it EVERY DAY! And if for whatever reason you can\\'t.. just do it the next day! In all of my years in dealing with social anxiety (and a negative family putting me down) I realize that the anxiety stems mostly from overthinking. Is that person looking at me from their car as I walk down the street? Am I worthless because I don\\'t have a job? Is what I\\'m wearing okay? etc. the list is endless. For me, social anxiety has stopped me from my potential being fully realized. It has stopped me from having a healthy relationship with pretty much any woman. It has stopped me from going out on the few beautiful days I see here.. I still have it, but not as bad. I practice a few things every day and you eventually reach a point of self confidence. You will know when you start to get comfortable with yourself and you start having thoughts like \"who gives a shit what they think! This is what I\\'M doing for me!\" One last note: I currently live in an area where cannabis is legal for recreational use. I started smoking not for my social anxiety itself but the fact that many other people here seemed to do it. I started smoking to make friends but now I keep smoking because it does make me feel good and content with the world around me. Not saying you should smoke pot but it is something that has helped me very greatly.

I’ve always knew that I was insecure. Ever since I was a kid, I had problems with certain body parts that I deemed as “imperfect.” But, it got worse over the years. When I turned 9, I started covering my face with my hair because I felt better if I wasn’t exposing too much of my face When I was 10, I started developing social anxiety and started wearing baggier clothing, I also started looking in the mirror for hours a day. When I turned 11, I started covering my face more than ever before, I’d only wear certain types of clothing that I thought were “less revealing,” my anxiety started to become worse than it’d ever been before and got pulled out of school for it. When I was 12, I started noticing changes in my appearance from hour to hour, or day to day, these changes were usually in my face. Everyday, I’d wake up and think to myself, “okay, am I gonna be pretty or ugly today?” I don’t really know what the real me looks like anymore, sometimes I barley recognize my own reflection. Sometimes I stare in the mirror for hours a day, just pointing out flaws or changes. Sometimes I avoid looking in the mirror all together. Most of the time I don’t even see myself as a human, or too ugly to even be a human. I’ve had thoughts of performing surgery on myself and imagining how perfect I’d be if I done it, but I try not to think about it. Everyday, I watch videos about plastic surgery. Somehow, I feel like all of my problems would be gone if I just changed some of my facial features, like I’d be able to live an actual life. I’d pay any price for it, I don’t care if it could kill me, I’d do it. When I used to go to school, I’d carry out certain ways of getting ready. I’d mainly go to school on days where I felt like I looked like an actual human, most of the times I’d just cry in front of a mirror saying to myself “you’re disgusting.” It’s gotten easier since I’ve stopped going to school, but it still bothers me a lot. Minor inconveniences like catching a person staring at me, or wind blowing in my face and blowing my hair away from it would ruin my day. At lunch and break, I’d sit in a bathroom stall looking at my face, most of the time, I’d look at it and wouldn’t wanna come out, then have to get sent home by teachers because I was too afraid to go into class. I’ve always held back from talking to people about how ugly I feel, especially my parents and doctors. My next appointment is next week, I’ve never talked to any of my doctors about me feeling disgusting, I’ve always just told them that I only feel anxious for no real reason. I think I might tell my doctor this week, maybe then I’ll actually begin to get better. I think most of the anxiety comes from me feeling incredibly ugly, so I think it’s best to work on that. Body dysmorphia is also a thing that people with social anxiety are more likely to have, so I guess it’s safe to say that it’s a possibility. I’m excited to talk to my doctor about this, because I feel like it might be the start of me actually beginning to feel happier again. I just don’t know if I should tell him about the wanting to perform surgery on myself, because he might see that as me having thoughts of self-harm. I usually don’t post anything on sites, but within the past few months, I’ve become more comfortable with talking to people. Anyways, leave a comment if you wanna say anything.

Once you have a list of some that you seem to like the looks of then start working up the courage to call them. If you can't do it try starting by calling your mom or something to get used to the process of calling people if you have trouble with that. Once you feel comfortable enough (It will never be comfortable but it will feel better) then you call them. You ask to set up and appointment and you show up at that appointment. Don't give up if the first place you call can't see you. Keep trying. Then you keep seeing them. Do your best to be as open and honest as possible and actually try the things they suggest you do no matter how stupid or or useless they seem. These are trained professionals, not someone looking to make you into a fool. With some time you will start feeling more stable. Not better, but stable. Then you start trying to work on finding something you enjoy. Games, movies, music, dogs, reading, helping old ladies cross the street. It really doesnt matter what it is. Just find something that sucks less than the other things and keep doing it. Try and see if there is a way to help the social anxiety while doing that. If you like dogs, go to a dog park or a regular park and ask to pet someones dog. If its movies maybe try to go to a movie store or something and buy/rent/look at a movie. If its music go to a record store and look at what they have. Just something you can do that adds a social element to whatever it is you find you like. And keep pushing that boundary. Hows your hygiene? If you arent showering at least every other day. Start. There is literally not a single excuse for not doing it. It is a small change that can help you feel a bit more fresh of mind. Hell, make that your first step if you think looking for a therapist is too much for you right now. I don't really know how severe your Social anxiety is. I don't know a single thing about you so its hard to really say what you should do but there are some good stepping stones for you. Just to reiterate. 1. Try and find a therapist using Psychologytoday.com, look for someone who focuses in suicide ideation and self harm. 2. Try and find something that is more enjoyable than other things. Something to look forward to doing and just enjoy it and once you are into it more, try and incorporate social aspects into it. 3. Shower at least every other day (every day is preferable) I don't care if you don't think you stink. It will help you feel refreshed every day. It seems like bullshit but trust me. It helps.

In middle school was my first relationship with this girl named C. It started when I asked her to a dance (which was extremely nerve racking), and that was before my SA got too bad. It was a pretty standard relationship. We held hands and hung out. Then we broke up like 2 weeks later. Then at the end of 9th grade I started dating a girl named M. We kinda dropped hints that we liked each other but never did anything about it. A few weeks into summer I mustered up the courage and sent her a long heartfelt text about how I really liked her and whatnot. I wasn\\'t really asking her out, but just making my feelings clear. Then like a week later she asked me out and I said yes. I think we hung out once during our relationship then she dumped me about 2 weeks in with the classic \"It\\'s not you, it\\'s me\" excuse. Fast forward 3 years to the end of summer before 12th grade starts. This girl named D that I kinda knew from school replies to a photo of my dog on IG and we start talking. I really like skateboarding and post a lot of videos of me skating and she complemented me on those. I told her that I could teach her if she wanted and after a little convincing we decided to meet. Initially I was REALLY nervous about meeting her. When I offered to teach her how to skate, I was just being friendly in hopes I might make a new friend to skate with. However she dropped some hints that she liked me which instantly made me 100x more nervous to meet her. I made one of my friends come along because I know he\\'s goofy and would take attention off me if I needed. Anyways the meeting went well and D and I continued to talk and become more friendly. After awhile we both know that we like each other and are basically bf and gf. For some reason D had this idea that someone had to explicitly ask the other person out for it to be a couple. She told me she wanted me to ask her out and I said that it\\'s silly to ask someone to ask you out. If you both want to date each other and both know that you want to date each other, then you\\'re basically bf and gf, no need for someone to ask the other out. Anyways she then asks me out a few weeks later and so I guess that\\'s technically the started of our relationship, but it\\'s whatever. I think we dated for around 5 months. D was the first girl that I ever truly felt like I loved. I genuinely felt like I would do anything for her and that I wanted to be with her forever. Then what felt like out of nowhere, she tells me she\\'s not happy and wants me to do more for her. She wants me to know what she wants without her telling me. I tell her I\\'ll try my best and we continue dating. A week later she dumps me because she just doesn\\'t like me anymore. For a few days I was extremely depressed. I sit through school feeling numb, then I\\'d come home and lie in bed watching youtube until it was time to fall asleep. I was even somewhat suicidal at some point. She also got mad at me because one of her guy friends threatened to beat the shit out of me if I talked to her and I basically called him a retarded and messed with him a little. Apparently in her mind, me messing with her friend was worse than him threatening to beat me up and so she stopped talking to me as well. At that point I wasn\\'t as depressed but I was still sad. But about a day after she stopped talking to me I suddenly realized that I didn\\'t need her. After I realized that, I instantly became happier. I stopped caring about her and started caring about myself. I started skating more often and talking to friends. It\\'s been about a month since we broke up and I\\'m feeling better than ever.

After a few months I got a job. I then got busy with that and didn\\'t do much for a while. Then I finally got the courage to try dating and found a girlfriend after a few months. Process was really slow with a lot of \"lull\" periods. Typically I would be really motivated for a week and try something new and then be demotivated for a couple and stop :/ Honestly still working on getting over those demotivated stages. I still get anxious over some things. I still overthink hair cuts. I still have trouble speaking up in groups.

Hi, before I begin talking about my social anxiety, I would just like to say that this is not my usual account, I created this because I feel that it would hinder my ability to properly express myself if I use my personal account. Sorry if this infringes on any of the rules, I am not totally familiar with them. You can take this down if you want or let me know and I will fix/take it down for you. Im 18 years old, male and I believe that I have some form of social anxiety and I want to share how it has so far affected my life. I recently started university in the UK and I am in a flat of 13 other people. My earliest memory, and I believe one of the causes of my social anxiety was Christmas day when I was about 6 or 7. My Uncle came to our house for the first time (he lived in another country) and he brought a camcorder. He filmed us opening our presents and I was so excited I always wanted to be on camera and see myself on the TV. When I heard my voice on the TV aged 6, I wanted it turned off immediately. I try never to speak on camera even now. I have usually found it really really hard to make new friends. If I make one, I latch on to him as much as possible and usually divert any conversations to them if someone I know tries to initiate a conversation with me. Im currently at 6 weeks into university and I haven’t made any friends, which is my fault because I don’t initiate any conversations and any conversations that I do have last around 6 seconds because I don’t know what to say to people. Its usually, goes “Hi, (insert name here)” - Other person “Hi (insert name here)” – Me “How are you?” – Other person “Good, you?” – Me “Im good” – Other person “That’s good” – Me (Awkward pause and I walk off to avoid further embarrassment) I promised myself that on the first day I moved in I would introduce myself to everyone but when I walked in, they said hi and I got really hot and flustered and couldn’t. I rarely leave my room, only to go to lectures and seminars (which I worry about hours beforehand) and I often go days without eating proper food because people are currently in the kitchen. At School it was a little bit of a benefit because while people would take time in their work to talk, I would out of awkwardness, concentrate fully on my work. Now at university, they suggest that you join or form a study group with your friends, which is hard because Im on the other side of the country and I have no friends here. I am really worried how I will communicate with others when we have to start giving group presentations and working in groups. We haven’t even been assigned one yet and it already takes up hours of worry in my mind. I am worried because I want to be successful at whatever it is that I am doing but I cant properly talk to people and I know that this will be a huge hindrance. I have never approached someone of the opposite gender and talked to them, I don’t know what to say. I only have one friend who is a girl and its more a friendship of association because she is my friends girlfriends. One of the feelings that I get when I am around people is a feeling of inferiority. I am 5 foot 5, which is small for a male, and have always been the smallest in my class. I have been mistaken for up to 6 years younger than I am and I think this is one of the causes of it. I cant just talk to someone for the sake of it I have to have a reason otherwise I would be wasting their time. If someone else initiates a conversation with one of my friends or vice versa I stand there really really awkwardly. I cant wait in queues with a whole bunch of people because I feel like I am holding them up. If I am waiting to go into a lecture, I wait towards the back of the group because I don’t want to add to their displeasure of waiting. Its almost as if, subconsciously, that my presence offends people. Not that I think that I am in any way important, quite opposite, I feel like a nobody. If there was anything important that I needed to ask someone about that I didn’t know from school, I would do it on facebook, and even then it would take a few hours to come up with what I saw as the right way to frame this. Even for this post, I have to keep reminding myself that it is anonymous. My parents don’t know how seriously it affects me. They think Im shy and often when I was younger they would get cross because I wouldn’t socially interact with other people for summer camps, for example. Anyway, the purpose of this post was to share my experience with social anxiety and at least get a little bit of the pressure off my chest.

My 'issues' started when I was 15, as far as I know. Right before my birthday I had gone through what I would consider to be a traumatic experience. And so began the slow and dreadful downhill spiral into complete nothingness. First I was just homeschooled. Then I lost all contact with supposed friends. Then the outside world completely. At this point I was still functional enough to mow the lawn and go to basic places like doctors, dentists, grocery stores, etc. Those eventually all stopped and I isolated myself, pretty much professionally if I do say so myself. After a while of kind of enjoying being alone I started not enjoying it so much. I found myself daydreaming of having friends and those memorable moments that don't take place on your mom's couch. And after not too long of that, I started feeling like I would die without it. But I didn't know how to talk to people anymore. What to say, how to act, what to do. In just a few short years I forgot how to be a human. I still have no fucking clue of what to do in social situations. But, and now fast forward to the present. I don't like people anymore and now those 'dreams' of having friends have turned into full blown nightmares of having (keyword having) to do stuff eventually. I can't just hide from the world my entire life no matter what 'reasons' I have. It's confusing though. I never maintain the same perspective for more than a few days. Some days I wake up feeling lonely, and praying for someone to text me. Others, I wake up not even being able to stand my little siblings saying good morning to me. On top of that, there's not voices, but there's definitely two different versions of my voice in my head. I'll attempt to provide at least a decent example. Version #1, I feel like I have a 2 foot dick just blowing it in the wind as I sit comfortably in my high horse and look down on all the peasants. Version #2, I feel like I have a 2 inch soggy day old breadstick from Little Caesar's say between my legs and I'm nothing more than the scum of the earth. (The dick metaphors are the best representation of one's ego I could think of. Just go with it. Pls.) Then there's the personality aspect of it. There's day where I talk to people on Skype and I couldn't be happier. I enjoy the shit out of myself and act like an idiot just for a good laugh. Then there's days where I wish I could hit the lottery. Just to hire a group of Russian mercenaries to kill all the stupid people that annoy me. The worst part, I'm not even talking about genuinely annoying. I'm talking about my version. Example, someone asking me a question that I feel is pointless, makes my head ring, and I go back to the thought of hiring mercenaries. I can't really explain this part well, but I feel like people do shit on purpose. There's NO way the general public is so stupid, and annoying that I actually pray for mass genocide on a daily basis. It just seems like something that can't be true. Right? And for me to have such a passionate hatred towards people in general when not everyone has ever done anything to me. I don't know.

I almost fell over and at first I was so shocked that I didn\\'t say anything as they walked away (just walked, didn\\'t even try to run) and my anxiety kicked in and I thought \"just don\\'t say anything\" but then about 10 seconds pass and I decided to shout at them. The time elapsed probably gave off signals that I\\'m not very assertive, plus my anxiety was probably evident so they just laughed at me and ran off. I continued walking, feeling pretty shit about myself. I sat down in my usual spot and I tried to relax but I couldn\\'t. I felt really anxious and shaky. I\\'m a pretty sensitive guy anyway, but this is something I\\'ve never experienced before and I kept playing over in my head how lame I sounded when I shouted at them and I actually felt like crying. While I was sitting under a tree, feeling terrible and trying not to cry in public I saw them come back over to me and one of them threw a rock at me. It didn\\'t hit me, but it freaked me out. Then before I could say anything, they started throwing rocks at windows, trying to break them. Seeing them again actually made me feel calm, my anxiety lifted. I was really nervous about passing them again to leave the park, but then when I saw them I realised they were just a bunch of idiot kids and I felt alright. Anyway, I called the police and they picked me up in a van and we drove around the neighbourhood trying to find them but couldn\\'t so they drove me home. I was hoping we\\'d catch them, because even though that would mean I would have had to face them again, I kind of wanted them to realise I wasn\\'t some push over who just allows kids to assault me. I wanted to talk to them again and teach them a lesson. But overall it worked out fine, so I\\'m happy about that. I tried my best and I feel good now, as opposed to anxious and shaky.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'I did it! I got my hair cut!. Im going to apologize in advance and just say that I often give too many details in my stories making them very long but that\\'s just how I do it. I like to explain everything. My thought process what I was thinking and feeling.. A few days ago I realised that my hair had gotten pretty long. It had been around 3 months since my last haircut. I know it was before December 24 2015. For a few hours last night before I went to bed I was trying to look up places I could get my hair cut. The price and how long it would take to walk. Every time I\\'ve had my hair cut and the hairdresser asks how to cut it I just stutter a \"err idk just shorter. Do what you want\" and in a thread I\\'ve made before about getting my hair cut people were suggesting that I show a picture of what I want done. So I looked up pictures of myself on phone and narrowed it down to 3 pictures I believe were taken a week or two after I had my hair cut. \"This looks short enough. I\\'ll just show them this\". The whole day leading up to me entering the door to the haircutter I was thinking \"should I go. Should I just do it another day\" but each step I took (eating breakfast, getting dressed, going outside) that got me closer to the haircutter the more forced I felt to actually go through with it. I tried to think less and just do it. The place is a rather small place and you can\\'t even pay with a card, only cash (as I found out) and the guy who cut my hair didn\\'t speak the language very well. When I went in there were 2 employees and the boss. All being with a customer and cutting their hair so I sit down and wait. Usually the place is pretty full (as I said it\\'s a pretty small room) and I was worried about looking like a fool in front of other customers trying to ask if they had time for a drop-in customer. A lot of people who go there seems to be friends with the owner too or know them very well which makes it feel worse. Like if the owner is just a complete stranger to them then we have something in common. I sit there for a couple of minutes and the owner (who\\'s cutting someone\\'s hair) makes eye contact with me like he\\'s wondering what I\\'m doing. Making me feel anxious ish. A guy walks in, he clearly knows the owner, after a bit he asks how long until he\\'s free. Owner says 5m and the guy goes outside to smoke or whatever. So there I am, just sitting there awkwardly, wondering if I should be asking if they have time for a drop in or something. Or do I just wait here until one of them is done cutting and stands behind the register?? Ofc i chose to sit there like a socially awkward dude. Once the owner is done with his customer he starts to get ready to go outside for a smoke break. I didn\\'t stand up or talk to him I just sat awkwardly. I felt like I had missed an opportunity. But a minute or so after that the other guy was done cutting his customers hair too and I asked him if he has time for a drop in and he said yes. And here\\'s the best part. Remember, this is the very first time I was going to show the haircutter a picture of how I want mine cut, so I had rehearsed it a million times in my head already. Show picture, say I want something like that, sit down. I awkwardly say \"is. . I brought a picture\" I pull up my phone which has the picture already loaded. \"Something like this?\" He takes the phone and asks \"do this?\" I\\'m like ..yeah do that. Like that. A few moments of silence after I sit down, he seems hesitant to cut it like that. \"Like that or.. better\" NO YOU\\'RE DEVIATING FROM THE SCRIPT. \"Ehh heh better I guess if you can\" are the words that leave my mouth. He says \"this picture.. not very good. Not that good looking hair\" I\\'m like well shit I spent like 10 minutes anxious over which picture to use and it\\'s not a great pic I agree but it\\'s fine. It\\'s short. I just want it shorter. So I say \"heh yeah do better if you can then. If you want\". \"I can do better\" he says and starts cutting. Once he\\'s done he says something and I was like huh what did you say? I asked that maybe 2 to 3 times during that whole visit. I felt like such an incompetent ass. Oh remember how I didn\\'t know it was a cash only place? He said nope sorry can\\'t pay with card here. And I\\'m like oh god.. \"where can I find an atm..\" he says around the corner \"you know where?\" I Say no and he gestures again around the corner. So I go around the corner but see no atm I ask 2 women passing by where the nearest atm is and it\\'s a biiit further away. Around another corner. I feel like the haircutter might think I\\'m not gonna pay so I had intentionally left my jacket behind. Had to stand in line for the atm (lady took god same forever) and I was thinking about how long it was taking me to get back so I could frikken pay him. Anyway I finally had it done. Usually my dad drives me to some place and comes with me (since he has to wait for me anyway) which makes me feel like shit and like a child. I\\'m 22. It looks good now I think and I rode the high of \" I did something today \" for a few hours after that. If you actually read everything then I\\'m sorry haha. I should learn how to be more concise but I just feel like I want to convey every detail possible. As if the person listening to my story was there. That\\'s why I like pictures. Shows what it actually is like instead of them having to imagine it. Maybe it just looks like a lot cus I\\'m on my phone.

I really don\\'t know where to start because my anxiety spreads across many categories. The most prominent and most harmful,though, is my fear of rejection. I am constantly dwelling on my peers\\' apparent perception of me. After every action I make, whether it be getting out of my chair or commenting on a coworkers statement, I analyze the body/facial expression of the other parties in the room. Most of the time my interpretation is a negative one. I am a first born child and am comfort able with my alone time and quite enjoy it but my ADHD makes me outgoing and talkative (though sometimes about obscure topics). I very much enjoy the connection from carrying on a conversation with someone and knowing that they understand and empathize with you. Throughout high-school I was the class clown. I always had some snide remark to make or an opinion to give on everything. I had my small group of friends but I felt that I annoyed even them. I graduated HS and decided enough was enough. I\\'m not gonna be that obnoxious guy anymore. I got back on my medicine and went off to college. Screwed up pretty bad my first semester and got kicked out of my housing (still enrolled ). I felt horrible about it because the offense that got me kicked out was something I told my parents I stopped doing a while back when they caught me. Anyway.. At this point I had just started to make friends outside of the people I knew from my hometown and I could see things about to turn around. But when I found out that I was being kicked out of my housing and wasting my parents 8k they had already spent on the following semester housing as well as the rent for the new place I fell into a really bad depression. I lost connection with all of my friends except one( who happened to be my previous roommate and got kicked out with me). We felt each other\\'s pain and consoled one another with alcohol and Xbox one. I started drinking .. A lot. Like everyday. Ironically it didn\\'t affect my grades though because we were still in freshman level courses and Calc always came easy to me. Fast forward 1 year. Me and roommate get a new place together and are doing great(or so it seems). We move into a little college apt complex where I already knew a ton of people. That first semester was great. We got along great daily and never fought. Shit we still have never fought. We hung out with the same group of friends and I was even more popular than him! I was having a great time and really loved my roommate/best friend like a brother. Then winter break came. All was going great. Still partying in my hometown and catching up with old friends and still hanging out with the ones that came home from school with me. Blah blah blah I ran into a girl from one of my classes downtown one night and we made plans to hangout. I brought a friend she brought a friend. The friend she brought ended up being my girlfriend and first love of 2 years. And my friend and the other girl hooked up a little but that\\'s a different story.... Getting tired of typing on phone so I\\'m gonna wrap it up ... Roommate and Girl from downtown start talking. (Me and that girl always had some spark between us but never made a move on it again story for another time) girl talks shit about roommate behind his back to me (dumb) calls him gay and says she only hangs out with him for a gay cuddle buddy. I tell him he doesn\\'t believe me. Asks her she denies it. She keeps talking shit. She starts getting really controlling and making him look like her puppy following her around and conforming to her every whim. It was nauseating. At this point there was a little tension between her and I as I was obviously not gonna take her side on things because she was manipulating my best friend and I was pretty blatant about that. But I decided to take the high road and still be her friend and what not. Things started to go south. She started to act weird and say passively rude things to me when she was drunk but never out right aggressive. She started to resent my other friend (the one that hooked up with her a while back ) and would be very aggressive with him at parties. To the point of getting him kicked out of a few. I didn\\'t care, he was being an ass most of the time and deserved it. Then she started lumping me into her little outbursts. And one night she got particularly drunk and went off on him. Once he was kicked out she turned it on me. I didn\\'t even listen to it though cause she was obviously obliterated so I just walked home. Next weekend there was a birthday party down the road from me and she was going as well as all my friends so I decided to go. Stayed for an hour or so but didn\\'t know many people and was getting bored so I went to leave. Said my good byes to the people I knew there and went for the door. Saw roommate and girl sitting by the door. Said bye to roommate and went to say bye to her but she was obviously ignoring me so I patted her lightly on the head and kindly said \"bye \\'girl\\'\" and opened the door. I hear \"did he just pat me on the head?? Is he calling me a dog or something ?!?\" I try to b line out of this drunken situation before it manifests into a full on shit show. But I was too late. She runs for the door and shoves me as much as she could and yells \"GET OUT!\" ( her signature drunken outburst at the time ) I turned around and calmly said \"\\'girl\\' I didn\\'t mean to offend you, we\\'re all friends here I\\'m sorry, you\\'re just drunk\" or something along those lines. She stops her feet in place and yells for roommate at the top of her lungs. And like clock work he comes running out of no where and stands by her side. I had had enough so I just grabbed my girl by the arm and we walked home. Then things started to get weird. I talked to my roommate about it and asked him why she was mad at me. He said she wasn\\'t. Okay cool. So i tried talking to her and she ignores me. Okay so I ask him again same response. Wtf roommate bros before hoes right? Apparently he had never heard the expression. Then a day would pass when I didn\\'t see or hear from him. Which hadn\\'t happened since the day I met him. Oh well I figured I\\'d let them work it out. Then weeks passed. Then we\\'d talk about bullshit. Then more weeks. Then a month. Then the semester was over and he left without saying a word. We had already signed a lease for the next semester and he told me a week before the next semester that he had backed out last minute and was living somewhere else. Great Well he moves in with some of my so called friends and then I lost contact with most of them as they were girls friends before mine. So I was slowly phased out of the group and then was all alone. And social anxiety has just snowballed.

            "{'sequence': '(\\'Friendless people, the key to not feeling like the worst person in the world is to stop caring (to state the obvious). For a while I never understood people who posted on here and on other subs saying they have no friends but they\\'re okay with that. If they\\'re okay with it it won\\'t change! But I was wrong. 90% of people are going to think you\\'re a weirdo for not having friends, but they don\\'t know you, and they\\'re shallow. No one is going to support your loneliness so you might as well accept that sometimes shit happens in life and you end up alone for a while but that\\'s okay and natural. I think the guilt of loneliness affects your mental health before the actual loneliness does. Growing up I became more and more aware of my lack of friends. I had more friends then than I have now, but less than most people I knew. For a long time I didn\\'t see the problem. When I didn\\'t see my lack of friends as a problem, this meant that when I was having a social interaction I wasn\\'t self conscious. I didn\\'t have my mothers voice in the back of my head telling me I should have more friends. I remember in school, between the ages of 12-16, I would yap and yap to anyone, and no, I didn\\'t make friends with everyone I talked to, but I made some, and was generally liked. As I got older, I cut off a group of friends from my home town because I had nothing in common with them and they were preoccupied with being popular and I wasn\\'t. My mam would always say that I needed more friends when she noticed I stopped hanging around them. I remember I brought 2 friends home for dinner and my sister said \"oh look, her friends. All 2 of them\". I became more aware of my loneliness. As my awareness increased, I got more withdrawn, basically a hermit, was overly critical of myself and overly self conscious. Because everyone around me was telling me it wasn\\'t okay to have few friends, even though I had been happy. Something that struck me in college was how everyone sort of acted as if they wanted to be perceived as popular. This was probably my warped SA perception, and this stopped me from talking to people. Sometimes I read threads here, particularly /r/relationships (my favourite sub) and see people talking about how having no friends is a \"red flag\" and that \"boring people finish last\" and that when you have no friends \"you\\'re the common denominator\" and there\\'s something wrong with you. I see where they\\'re coming from, and while reading things like this serves to make us all more self aware, it doesn\\'t make it easier, and it\\'s not healthy to blame yourself. I had an epiphany recently and I realized that... people in my hometown probably don\\'t talk about me negatively, if I talked to them they\\'d probably be open to me. People I meet daily that I think hate me, don\\'t hate me, if they do they\\'re basing it off one encounter, they don\\'t know me and I shouldn\\'t care. When I walk my dog, people who see me out in public don\\'t know I\\'m unemployed and friendless, or that my hair is really greasy. No one but me has felt my pain or understands, so screw it. Even if I have screwed up my reputation by being a recluse, it\\'s so easy to change how people see you, if you only have the courage to try. There\\'s no point in feeling guilt about SA. We are going to find friends at some point or another, our SA will die down eventually with personal growth or outside help. We might as well be okay with our circumstances in the meantime. I used to spend all my alone time (so, all the time) feeling bad about it, but what\\'s the point? That will only make me more bitter. Let\\'s stop acting like having no friends is the worst thing in the world. We\\'re not actually missing out on much, maybe this realization will help us to stop trying too hard in social situations and messing up. Loneliness is painful but only because other people make it painful by reminding us how flawed we are. I know it\\'s impossible to implement \"stop caring\" overnight, but please try. I hope other friendless people out there can get to the point in life where they don\\'t care what others think, because after 22 years it has finally freed me. *Tl;dr: People make us feel shit for not having friends. But realize if people didn\\'t make us feel shit about ourselves, we\\'d probably be okay. Try and get to the point where you realize that it\\'s okay to be who you are and be happy alone. Stop comparing yourself to others and just stop caring what people think.

I\\'ll just get right into the story of what just took place. Incoming wall of text, bear with me.

I\\'ve never been bar hopping, not even a bar since I turned 21 (in April. Normally I just go to the liquor store down the street and drink with my roommate or by myself). I told them I\\'ve never done it before so if they could guide me through it that\\'d be great, and they said sure. So it comes time to start walking. One of the guys is already drunk, the other is super experienced with this stuff. I felt so out of place. Not to mention they were wearing shirts that supported the home team (football game AND homecoming tonight, that alone should have told me it\\'d be way too busy for me to handle, especially for my first time at a bar). I was wearing what I normally wear, some jeans and a black sweater and nasty grey vans that I wore to work today and forgot to change out of. Not to mention these guys are way taller than me. I\\'m not even short, I\\'m 5\"11 but they were a few inches taller than me so all of this combined made me feel so out of place. So basically I was going into a social anxiety nightmare already anxious a fuck for other reasons than I was going out. Fuck. The walk took about 15 minutes, felt like forever, but when I got to the bar, I felt like it didn\\'t take long enough. This bar was packed beyond reason. Inside it didn\\'t look like there was anywhere to even move. And the line was massive. Halfway up, my friend decided now was the best time to mention there\\'s a $5 front. I didn\\'t know what that meant (in case someone doesn\\'t either, it means a $5 fee to get in). I had already told him I didn\\'t have any cash on me but he said don\\'t worry, they take debit cards. Here\\'s where I really start to panic. I ask if he can spot me and he said no, I should have brought cash with me. Fucking hell. Second panic: the people behind me are so close, like they kept brushing up against me and bumping into me. I can\\'t stand people touching me unexpectedly. But I\\'m at a bar, obviously that happens. But I start to freak out thinking the people around me can hear me say I don\\'t have the money, asking me friend, not knowing what to do, thinking they think I\\'m a loser for not knowing how to do this. I\\'m just about to leave because I\\'m about to have a break down. I tell my \"friend\" I think I\\'m just going to bail. He\\'s like yea okay whatever. I then start thinking the people behind me are thinking I\\'m even more of a loser for bailing and not doing what everyone else is doing. I end up saying fuck it and I start walking away. I walked towards the Taco Bell across the street and call my roommate and ask him to pick me up there. He said he was actually on his way to his girlfriend\\'s. I said oh never mind then, I don\\'t want you to drive all that way. He said it\\'s not a big deal and he comes to pick me up. Now I feel bad about inconveniencing him.

I have been homeschooled from Pre-K to senior year, and I am 18 now. For the most part I have been oblivious to the public perception of this method of teaching. I see everywhere online that it\\'s kind of frowned upon. People say that homeschoolers are anti-social white-trash potential school shooters. Everytime I see these comments I feel a strong pang in my chest. I actually don\\'t consider myself to be very weird, I am kind of average to be honest. I am obsessed with music, love my netflix, and enjoy travelling. Not very weird I wouldn\\'t think. I try very hard to hide the fact that I was homeschooled, simply because I immediately get lumped into these stereotypes. As a homeschooler, I feel like something was stolen from me. I never asked to be different. It doesn\\'t feel fair to me that I have this burden of an alternate lifestyle. I think it kind of stems from my personality. I hate conflict and hostile opinions. Which might be caused by my homeschooling. Such a mess right? My mother has a strong passion for homeschooling, and I remember her telling me that she would cry if I decided (or got forced by CPS) to go to public school. This created a sort of \"guilty conscious, or feeling that I have to stick with the program to keep her happy. She would actually threaten to \"put me in public school\" if I tried to talk to her about my doubts. Don\\'t get the wrong idea about her though, I love her and can kind of see where she\\'s coming from. She may have had a bad time in high school, so it\\'s like a terror to her.

I feel like my education could have been better, for the past few years I have mainly been teaching myself because my mom is hella busy. I am working on my ACT and I\\'ll hopefully get into college, which I am not sure I can do since I am a homeschooler. I don\\'t even know if I have a GPA, because there hasn\\'t been any kind of grading going on, not that I know of anyway. I am really good at math, but not so good at factoid/common-sense stuff. Right now I am in a jiu-jitsu class (free at my gym) and my instructor will constantly ask for a factoid, like \"How much blood is in the body?\" or \"What\\'s the fastest animal on Earth\". I couldn\\'t answer either of these, and it really bothers me. I feel like I should know this stuff, and I might have known it if I was in public school. Sometimes I will know one, but can\\'t think of it fast enough. Somehow, I always end up looking like an idiot in front of my class. Whether it be not answering questions, or having an insanely hard time with directions and spatial awareness. Yes, the homeschooling was for religious reasons. My mom says it\\'s because she met a homeschooler and was impressed, but I kind of doubt that. She\\'s an extreme Christian of sorts. She taught me creation science for a while, but I learned how it\\'s fraudulent. I have a basic understanding of evolution now, but I probably don\\'t know as much as other people my age. She\\'s also a big conspirator. Alex Jones, 9/11 Truth, FEMA, etc. I believed these too, but have since shaken them off. I am actually still in the closet about a lot of this stuff because I don\\'t want to have a heated discussion with her. I am still a Christian, but I have a lot of problems with religion. I guess it\\'s more of a personal thing that I don\\'t feel the need to express or go to church for. I have never had a girlfriend. I have never even had a kiss before. I have held hands with a girl and I took one on a date. But, the date was a disaster (she was kind of a bitch, and she didn\\'t consider it to be a date) and the \"holding hands\" part grossed me out. It\\'s starting to drive me crazy in a way, I really want to experience love, romance, and sex are like. But I feel like I have been permanently cockblocked by my upbringing. I\\'ll probably die a virgin. Anytime I have been close to starting something up with a girl, my mom wasn\\'t too far behind me. I feel like once they see my mom and the interactions we have, they write me off as a \"momma\\'s boy\" and immediately lose any attraction they once had. I am actually a pretty attractive looking guy, but the way I am drives them away. I have never had a job (unless you could call mowing your grandmother\\'s grass a real job). I have a supreme fear of the unknown here. Like I feel like they won\\'t hire me because I am not the best at social skills. Or, I feel like I am going to fuck up really bad with whatever they assign for me. Or, I feel like I will get bullied by coworkers and have a horrible time there. The real world is a scary concept to me, I have seen how horrible people can be on the internet (especially with the \\'kys\\' and red hot angry comments). I feel like I am too soft for the world, too sheltered. I feel like I will get eaten alive almost. So, it creates a vicious cycle, I don\\'t know when I\\'ll get a job, or what job I will get. But I know I need to get one because I\\'ll need a source of income soon (I rarely spend my money, so I have a lot of it). Because I don\\'t have a job and don\\'t exactly have a \"rich family\". I don\\'t have a phone, or a car. I have to use my parents phone and car anywhere I go, and I hate it. It severely stifles my freedom. I couldn\\'t go do anything without them knowing, I know this for a fact. My dream is to shed the stereotypical image I have and live a meaningful life. I want to have good friends, a wife, a good job, a house, etc. I don\\'t want to be seen as that weird guy, or that loner, I want to be somebody. I don\\'t know where to start, even though I was brought up in a good household (no domestic violence or anything), I carry a lot of baggage.

            "{'sequence': \"('I negotiated a 10,000$ increase to my salary. Hello SA, I want to share with you guys a milestone that I never thought I’d ever reach, and furthermore, a milestone that the past me would never have even dreamt as possible. My hope is that I can inspire people to see that it is truly is possible for anyone to massively and significantly improve themselves and fight through their own social anxiety. Warning, this post is quite long, but if you enjoy reading about a person’s journey’s to self-improvement, then this post is for you. A bit of backstory on me. I’m 22 right now, but I’ve been fighting social anxiety ever since I was in fifth grade (that’s rounds out to about half of my life). For as long as I remember, I hated myself, and there was a multitude of reasons for this such as growing up poor in a rich area, being different from all my peers (mixed race, foreign sounding name, etc.), and not seeing a healthy relationship between my mother and father. The way I coped with my insecurities was through video games. Lots and lots of video games. It was so easy to escape the reality I hated by living in another one that made me feel alive. I did this for years and years, throughout middle school and especially through high school and into college. With all the time I invested into video games, I was severely underdeveloped in my social skills, and I’d even pit myself in the bottom 10% next to anti-social deaf people. Everywhere I go, I would avoid eye contact with people. I hated even going outside and seeing other people, because I just knew how awkward and weird they would think I am for the way I looked and the way I walked. Class was a nightmare. I’d try to sit in the back, and every time the teacher would call on me, my heart would race to the speed of light, and my voice would quiver as I attempted to formulate a semi-coherent sentence. By now you might be wondering how the hell did I transform from this video game addicted, socially awkward boy with low self-esteem into a person that could stand up for himself? Answer: I got tired. Tired of living life feeling like a piece of shit. Tired of not even being able to look into the mirror without cringing. Tired of thinking I wasn’t worth anyone’s time, and that I’ll die alone. And that’s when I discovered /r/socialanxiety. For the first time I saw that I wasn’t the only one in the world dealing with what I thought was my own unique personal hell. I heard stories, stories of peoples’ struggles, and even some of their success. But to be honest, I never found enough actionable advice here to steer my life in the right direction, so I started looking elsewhere. I started looking at other subreddits, and I even started reading self-improvement books and listening to podcasts. Somewhere around this point, something finally clicked in my head that me realize that change is possible, “even for me.” Here are three steps I followed to transform my life after believing that I could transform my life: Step 1) I started an exercise regimen and eating healthier. Even though my routine sucked and I made every mistake in the book, the small progress I made further made me see that I could improve my own physique through grit and not shoving junk food down my throat. Let’s not kid ourselves, appearances do matter, not so much that they should dominate every ounce of your thought and life focus, but I’ve come to learn that neglecting it and pretending like it doesn’t matter only perpetuated a cycle of negative thoughts about myself such as “I’ll never look good, I’m not like that, I’m ugly, etc.” If you feel ugly now, working out and dressing decently can unsurprisingly improve the way you feel about yourself. Try it. If you’re fighting social anxiety like I was, you’re going to need every bit of improvement you can get and this one can even be done without any social interaction (though that is against the road of improvement). Step 2) I started paying attention to my body language. I think this may be one of the hardest points to tackle as a person with SA, and I can’t even say that my own personal body language is in tip top shape as of yet, but I can say that even by being aware that body language exists puts you miles ahead of the average person with SA. So much communication is portrayed through the body, such as standing up straight, not looking down at the ground, and even just how you deal with silence. If you’re a guy and you’re into girls, this a quality that is heavily observed, much more so than the verbal communication. If you’re a girl, you probably know this and have more of knack for this than the average guy does. However complicated this may seem, simple things that I mentioned such as standing up straight and keeping your head-up can psychologically boost your mood. Step 3) I did things I was uncomfortable with, step by step. I think this is the hardest and most crucial step of my process, and it could be divided into countless sub-steps and stories, but I want to hit the main point that the only way to become comfortable is to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. Here’s an example. I’m at grocery store, I really don’t want to ask the worker for help finding an item. But I do it, just to see what will happen. I’m nervous. I approach her and ask where the broccoli is. She tells me it’s on aisle seven. “Shit I don’t where aisle seven is, should I ask her, no she’ll think I’m weird.” I nod okay and walk away quickly. “Shit, why didn’t I ask her to point me to where aisle seven is .“ I find another worker, then ask if he can show me to aisle seven, and sure enough he happily tells me where to go. I realize this isn’t so bad and am now not afraid to ask for directions. The point of this example is take small steps and experiment for yourself. The more you do, the more you will learn. And I hate to say it, but most of what we learn isn’t through others, but by our own doing, and especially doing things that we think will suck. Now I could tell my own personal stories on this topic for pages and pages, but I want to highlight that I’ve done things as uncomfortable as confronting someone about their shitty behavior, asking girls to dates (*gasp*, no way, how is that possible, as my old self would say), actually being on the date and making mistakes (learning mistakes I’ll have you know), and even performing on a stage in front of a live audience. But the most recent highlight is negotiating my salary at my current job. I did my research about my current job that I’m getting hired for, and I noticed that I was being heavily underpaid for the position. I knew that being underpaid would make me feel resentment as an employee and not allow me to do my best work, so I decided “fuck it, rather than have a terrible time at this position feeling passive-aggressive about my situation and being weird in the office, I’m going to tackle this right now.” I looked up as many negotiation tactics as possible, spent time in the shower for a week debating with my manager in my imagination, and finally reassured myself that I know my worth. I approached my manager 2 days ago. Long story short, I nailed the negotiation and got a 10k salary raise. All the uncomfortable things I ever dealt with leading up to this made me the person I was going into that negotiation. All the hard work, mistakes, pain, and learning that I did made me become someone who was worthy of that 10k raise. If you threw 16 year old, or even 20 year old socially awkward me into the same position, I would not have not have raised a single word. I probably would not have even passed the interview for this job. As long as this post has been, there’s so many details that I left out, but I really hope that I’ve demonstrated that it is truly is possible to fight your own social anxiety, and even use it as fuel to better yourself. I still have lots of room to grow, and I’m not the most socially savvy or charming person you’ll ever meet, but I can say with confidence and pride that I’m 100 times better than the person I used to be.')\", 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with positive effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect', 'outdoor activity or space with negative effect'], 'scores': [0.3479962944984436, 0.34013640880584717, 0.31186726689338684]}\n",
            "{'sequence': '(\\' Will soon be having a conversation with my manager about my SA... Hey guys. So I\\'m a lower level supervisor where I work and today I had to get together with a group of my co-workers and my manager to go over some things that they (co-workers) haven\\'t been completing on a consistent basis. Performance stuff basically. My manager and I had talked the night before about how we were going to approach the meeting and we agreed I would try and take the lead on most of the conversation and he would chime in when necessary. He, as well as a majority of management (big company, lots of higher-ups) know that I have some anxiety issues, but don\\'t really know the extent of it for the most part. So the meeting didn\\'t go all that great. Not terrible, but not very good. I started things off and kind of just nose dived into what the group of co-workers had done wrong the day before. No intro, no nice lead in or explanation as to why we were there. Just \"ok so this wasn\\'t done, that was dirty, this wasn\\'t taken care of..\" etc, etc. My manager ended up back-packing the meeting per usual and the day continued on as it normally would. Well towards the end of the day he wanted to get together again (just him and I) so that we could talk about how it went. We go into the same room where we held the meeting that morning which is this bright ass (like apple store bright) conference room and we start to chat. We go over some normal day to day stuff and then we get on the subject of how we think the meeting went. I told him I think it could have gone better and he agrees which is why he wanted to talk with me to begin with. I told him I\\'m particularly aware of my public speaking difficulties and that I know I could have directed the meeting in a more constructive way. I told him I struggle with certain things and that I\\'ve been devoting a lot of time outside of work to try and help with that stuff. Then he stopped me and asked me what type of struggles.. I paused for a second and said \"oh, well I have anxiety and uh..\" pause, not looking at him.. \"it\\'s just been really hard and, uh..\" At this moment I started to well up with tears. He could tell I was on the verge of crying and I knew I would if I said anything else so I told him I needed to step away for a second. So I stepped into an empty office and just tried to wait out the emotion. I was completely, utterly overwhelmed. After a couple minutes he came over and asked me if I\\'d Iike to walk outside with him for a bit. We took a walk around the neighboring businesses while I, thoroughly embarrassed, stammered out the few sentences of explanation that I could (I should say that my manager is a really good dude, fairly close to my age and also super understanding). He let me know that he\\'s all ears if I\\'d like to try and talk about everything at a later time as I was just about finished with my shift for the day. I told him that I\\'ve actually been wanting to do that for a while so we agreed that he\\'d give me a call within the next couple of days to discuss things.. I know I need to talk about a lot with him, I just don\\'t know *how* much. Do I tell him the full truth? That I\\'m severely depressed because of my SA and that if affects me every day of my life? That it drastically inhibits my ability to perform as a supervisor? I was on the verge of breaking down at work which is something I\\'ve never done, ever. Let alone in front of my boss. I\\'ve spent my whole life trying to hide my SA and have developed an ultra thick, guarded wall as a result. I\\'ve avoided these types of conversations with people (other than my family) because of how overwhelming the emotions become. I\\'m scared that if I completely open up to him I\\'ll raise serious questions about my ability to perform my job requirements. Either way, the dynamic between him and I will absolutely not be the same after this convo. This post became way, waay longer than I meant it to be. Cheers if you made it all the way to the end. Thank you..sincerely, for any responses. TL;DR I ended up nearly crying in front of my manager after being overwhelmed with emotions when asked to elaborate on my struggles with SA. We planned a follow up conversation at a later time so that I can gather myself and allow for a proper explanation. Now I\\'m just not sure how much I want to share with him as I\\'m scared it might jeopardize my job, or at least my standings within my department. \\')', 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with negative effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect', 'outdoor activity or space with positive effect'], 'scores': [0.4876715838909149, 0.31426817178726196, 0.19806022942066193]}\n",

So ever since I was born till about 5th or 6th grade I was always a outgoing kid just the polar opposit of how I am today. I wasn't shy I could male new friends and talk to other kids with no worries at all. I went to a school that was k-8 I stayed there all the way till 8th grade and so did pretty much everyone from my starting kindergarten class did the same so we were real close shared birthday parties , had sleepovers all of us were on a soccer team for a good while. But at around 5th grade i started to get a bit chubby i dont know if it was pubery or my aunt always giving me treats. And the same friends who i had known since kindergarten started teasing me not all but most also we were kinda finding who we were and making our groups of friends. So this put me down to where i didnt wanna go to birthday parties anymore or do things with them because i knew I would be made fun of or called fat or asked why my face was red all the time so i started staying home alot. My dad didn't like this so he would make me go to these events where i would be teased. I never told him and I would have to make a scene to not go. So he gave up on me going and i kinda just stayed at home all the way till we graduated till 8th grade I wasn't the weird kid everyone made fun of i had friends i guess I just got used to being teased brushed it off and all that bit it bothered me i would have breakdowns cry askingy parents if I was fat. I went to a different high school then everyone else didn't grt teased and felt a bit better i geaduated got in shape and all but all of that just kinda left a mark.

I more freaking out oit about what the person thinks about how i look how i talk what I say how I performy duties.

            "{'sequence': \"('Should I talk to her?. This is going to be a long story as there is a lot of backstory/context needed to understand. Those who are ‘meant’ to read this  and offer guidance, will. I hope :) No idea how to cut it down into a TLDR as it is far too lengthy. I'll try to keep this first backstory as short  and to the point as possible. I'm 21, live in Australia on the east coast, grew up in Sydney and lived there until I was 18. I have a sister who is 7 years older who still lives in our hometown. Lost my father at a young age at 13. I've been battling depression for over 5 years since I was 15. I moved 2 hours away from my hometown at 18  and my depression got much worse. I stopped seeing friends, stopped going out, stopped talking to my friends/family which led to dealing with anxiety issues which led to social anxiety due to isolating myself. (Among other symptoms) I've recently started seeing a psychologist, getting out of the house more, I'm finally starting to feel like going out  and doing things. I want to meet people. I've been out more/done more in January of this year than I have the past 2 years. Finally starting to feel 'normal'. I still haven't reconnected with any of my old friends. I haven't posted anything on my personal social media accounts (Facebook/Instagram/Snapchat) since I first moved in late 2014. Haven't spoken to any friends since then  and haven't seen them either. Some have reached out to me but I never replied. Haven’t had a job since I moved up here either. For some reason I'm still afraid to reach out to them because I know that will lead to eventually meeting up with them in person. I'm even afraid to post anything on social media from fear of them reaching out to me. Because I know this will lead down the same route. I haven't made any new friends since moving from my hometown, haven't worked or studied  and basically feel like a complete failure. Afraid of what they will say, think or feel about me cos I have no life per say. I have already made a post looking for advice/guidance regarding the issue related to my old friends, however the above context was necessary to lead onto my next story which I am solely looking for advice/guidance for. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ New years eve I went to a house party with my older Sister cos I had nothing else to do, literally, and met all her friends etc. People were drinking, majority of people were on drugs, MDMA, LSD  and Ketamine was available. I hadn’t had drugs for 3 years since Australia day in 2014 when I was 18. I didn’t plan on taking anything. I met a girl who lived there, friend of my sisters who’s my age - lets call her Mary. I was told by a few people she thought I was attractive  and wanted to hookup. I haven’t hooked up with anyone for over 2 years and I actually was thinking that about her anyway so I was keen. I was drinking a lot when I first got there because of my anxiety, meeting new people etc. and ended up having to stop drinking because I was getting sick mixing it with weed. (Only drank 4 times last year so I had a very low tolerance). A few hours later I was in Marys room with her, my sister  and another girl who lived there just talking; lets call her Barbara. Barbara asked if we all wanted to get any more MDMA caps (her bf had stuff people could buy during the night). All of them had already taken an MDMA cap each earlier on in the night  and they all said yeah to having another one, which left me to decide; I ended up asking for one since I felt comfortable, didn’t feel pressured by them and the moment felt right to do it (granted my judgement was way off cause I was drinking/smoking; not the best idea to jump on drugs with people you barely know, but I felt safe being with my sister). So I took mine with them  and they left me and Mary in the room not long after. Started talking to Mary, getting to know her and all that. Basically having a d andm. She was telling me that she is going overseas this year to a US summer camp for 6 weeks. I felt so unaccomplished  and like a loser basically because there’s no way I could do that. I told her she’s really ambitious  and we started talking about other things while smoking weed together. We ended up hooking up for awhile, kissed at midnight  and started talking more after that. At one point while we were outside having a cigarette, she asked me to tell her ‘my life story’, it caught me off guard cos if I’m honest I don’t even know what it is. I got about halfway through  and somehow we got interrupted and I never got to hear hers or finish mine. I realised I was saying a lot of bad things that had happened in my life, rather than who I am and what I do? Anyway, Mary  and Barbara decided to come back with me, my sister  and her partner back to their place about an hour or two after Midnight to spend the rest of the night together. They were all going to take a tab of LSD each when we got back, I didn’t want to have psychedelics so I had a second MDMA cap. When we got back to my sisters place , Mary  and Barbara lost an acid tab when we got there. Eventually we all gave up looking for it  and they all took a tab each. Not long after taking the tab it got kinda weird with her, her vibe changed  and she wasn’t talking much, we weren’t as ‘close’ physically as earlier (not cuddling n stuff) but we were holding hands? They were all waiting for the LSD to kick in  and everyone wasn’t really talking much, and cos I hadn’t taken a tab I wasn’t on the same ‘level’. I think that’s where things changed cos my 2nd MDMA cap was coming on while her tab was coming on so we were on different wavelengths. We were all chilling in the lounge room laying down for about an hour and it was pretty obvious Barbara was the 5th wheel. Mary, her friend  and my sister went into her room and were talking for awhile. Eventually they came out and we all went for a cigarette on the balcony and they basically came and said they were leaving. They were going to stay the night then an hour or two later after we got back they said they were leaving cos her friend wanted to be with her boyfriend. I was too out of it to leave the unit  and when I said ‘I’m too f*cked to leave when Mary asked me if I was coming she said 'well your ambitious’. Never has my gut dropped so much. Instant regret. Such a horrible feeling, intensified by the drugs. I’m sure they left cos they started feeling uncomfortable being there, particularly Marys friend being the 5th wheel without her BF on new years eve. My sister, her partner  and I all planned on coming back to their placed to end the night there regardless, a safe place to come back to. So we kind of all had it in our head that we weren’t leaving after we got back. Looking back I wish I went back with Mary  and her friend but it probably wasn’t the best idea because they ended up taking another tab and ‘day-tripped’. Which could have ended up quite messy since it was pretty messy after they left anyway just being with my sister n her partner. Who knows what would happened - I never will know cos I chose not to go. I told my sister n her partner the next morning what Mary said when she left  and I asked them if I screwed up by not going back with her - my sisters husband said yeah i thought I heard her say something like that but my sister sort of dismissed it. They were both pretty adamant that I hadn’t ‘fucked up’ though - the next day my sister said she spoke to Mary on FB and asked her about what she said before she left that night  and she said that she didn't say that at all, something like 'oh alright then' was what she apparently said but I didn't really believe it. Mary sent me a message first on snapchat a couple days after new years basically saying ‘hey was nice to meet you had a nice time  and we said we should chill n have a sesh sometime’ etc. So we started talking a little bit, went to buy weed from their place a day later  and added her on FB but didn’t ask for her number. Such an idiot. Anyway, It was my sisters birthday the first week of 2017  and she had a party the first weekend (7th Jan - Saturday), Mary  and I were both going so we were going to catch up there. I was talking to her leading up to my sisters bday party after i came home on the Thursday and then the next night I had a panic attack after smoking some weed (happened cos of repressed emotions from traumatic domestic event in late 2016)  and went to the doctor the next morning for a referral to a psychologist along with some sort of temporary medication to help me sleep  and I haven't spoken to her since. And with all my anxiety i'm afraid to even talk to her because its been over a month and she probably thinks I’m a rude douchebag but then again she may not even think twice about it. My sister said she knows I have a lot going on in my life at the moment so she probably doesn’t mind. I felt like I got attached to her way too quickly after that night, or perhaps attached to the idea of potentially being with someone? Since it had been so long since I’ve actually had that physical connection with someone it was quite difficult to just ‘let go’ and forget about it. I became afraid of this attachment and decided to stop talking to her to detach myself, I didn’t want to come across as needy or obsessive. Couldn’t stop thinking about her for 2 weeks afterwards. Avoiding talking to her ended up making me think of her more. She hasn’t messaged me since I didn’t reply to her last message so as far as she’s concerned she may not even think about me at all? When I was younger I used to talk to girls day  and night (not exactly proud of it) but my point is I had confidence, I wasn't anxious or insecure - like I’m too afraid to even message Mary? I just feel awkward after hooking up with her, when I went to her place  and added her on FB I was so awkward around her, didn’t know how to act around her after hooking up  and being so f*cked from the drugs lol - I just want to be able to talk to her and get to know her,  and i don’t really feel like getting to know her through text is how I want to do it either, I’d rather do it in person. But then I’m awkward in person after hooking up lol, don’t how to be. Don’t know what to do, she keeps popping in my head. Feel like I’m not worthy enough, not enough self worth  and confidence. No job, no car, no license, no friends, what do I have to offer? I lift weights, I’m fit, I’m healthy, I’m intelligent, I’m educated, own my own business, I feel like I’m attractive - definitely not ugly, but can barely bring myself to message her on Facebook. Am I just mentally stuck on this whole thing? Do I need to let it go  and move on? I know the next move would be to reach out to her again  and eventually ask to meet up in person  and go from there. But my social anxiety is stopping me. I feel like there is a lot that has gone unsaid between us that should be spoken about  and idk if thats me overthinking it but I don’t even know how to bring that up to her either. I feel so weird thinking all of this when I barely know her. I just don’t know what to do, or how to ask her how she feels about the whole thing cos apparently she got out of a year long relationship herself  and according to my sister ‘she probably isn’t looking for anything’. So as far as Mary is concerned it may have just been a one time thing to hook up on New Years; I don’t know her well enough to make that judgement and don’t feel comfortable enough to talk to my sister about it anymore cos I told her about getting attached and she made me feel like a complete idiot for being like that. Idk if it was because I was on MDMA (I know it dissolves boundaries  and you generally have a better connection with other people, the ‘love drug’, very euphoric) but I was drawn to her in a way I have never experienced before (before taking the MDMA), normally I'm sexually attracted to girls like yeah I find her attractive but that's not what drew me too her - idk how to explain it. Like a deeper connection? I don’t want to say like a soul mate, but I’ve never felt a connection like this with a person before? But then again it could be a superficial connection with the drugs. I really have no idea! Any opinions/advice/guidance would seriously be appreciated so much! I have no one to talk to about this. I got about a 1/3 way through the story with my psychologist in todays session  and it’s just eating me up inside! I want to get out of this mental rut!

            "{'sequence': '(\\'Up  and Out, Not Down  and In. Over the more than 20 years that I battled social anxiety before finally overcoming it, I developed the concept of “up and out, not down and down and in”. This sounds simple but it was incredibly effective. It was a little reminder I would give myself that I applied specifically to my gaze and body language in order to turn around any situation where I could feel myself becoming very socially anxious and potentially losing control and spiralling into a full-blown anxiety attack or “episode”. Having had SA for most of my life, I developed a very intimate relationship with it and one of the most interesting things I noticed about it, was that it has most power when not faced - either figuratively or literally. I found it was most potent when left to wreak havoc in that space just out of the corner of your eye or mind’s eye. That couple you can kind of see out of the corner of your eye in the coffee shop and can hear laughing, but are too anxious to turn to look at - you just \"know\" they are laughing at you. You start to feel awkward and you become certain they are giggling more at how conspicuously uncomfortable you are becoming. The book you were originally reading, you are now only using as a prop as a place to fix your eyes. You can feel your thoughts starting to race and feel yourself spiralling towards an anxiety attack. You just \"know\" they can see your excruciating awkwardness and your redness and sweating starting to build, and are delighting in it with those shrill laughs. That person you see coming towards you on the pavement. You’ve only taken a quick glance from 30 yards away, but you can just immediately \"tell\" that it’s that person that used to bully you at school. Your heart explodes and you start to feel it pumping in your neck - not just your chest. You feel sick from the adrenaline. Your head drops, your shoulders round over. Pull out your phone and pretend to take a call so you can turn around? Cross the street? Look at the ground, look at the ground, walk as fast as you can. Let’s just get through this. Why the hell does this kind of stuff always happen to me? Any of this sound familiar? In these (perceived) stressful situations your gaze drops submissively downwards, your attention turns inwards to your own racing thoughts and heartbeat, and your body begins to curl up into a defensive ball - shoulders come up to the ears as if to protect yourself from an imminent blow, arms fold across the chest and the head drops. It was at exactly such moments that I would remind myself of “up and out, not down and in”. As I felt my body and thoughts being crushed by the weight of what I believed was happening around me in situations like those above, I would deliberately push back against it. I would bring my head and gaze up, sit upright, take a deep breath and stretch as if I was uncomfortable from sitting too long, push out my chest and turn my awareness outwards. As I stretched, as if yawning, I would take a good look around the room. And when I did, I found something incredible happened... I found that these nightmare-ish scenarios that I thought were unfolding around me existed as mere phantoms in the corner of my eye and mind’s eye - in my physical and mental peripheral vision as it were. When I turned to look at what was really happening it was as if the scales fell from my eyes and I was awoken from a bad dream. Where I imagined terrible demons looming up, there were only pleasant everyday people, going about their lives. The couple in the coffee shop were a pair of young lovers, so into each other and canoodling so much they hadn’t even noticed me, let alone given a f*ck about what I was doing. The guy walking toward me on the pavement wasn’t that guy from school 20 years ago. I had just managed to project my worst fears onto him and make his face morph into someone else. Amy Cuddy has talked at length about the link between posture and mind, and I find that this “making myself big” brings about an immediate change in me mentally. It is effectively a way of striking a “power pose” and this change in physical state brings about a change in the mind and body - even changing hormone levels! It’s as if I am physically throwing off the pressure which I had been allowing to build up on me, which in turn was shrinking my posture down physically into a weaker and more submissive pose. This then becomes a downward spiral as submissive body language feeds into ever more negative thoughts...and on and on. As I look around the room in such instances or face the person I was worried about, I turn myself from a feeling of the passively observed to potent observer. The gaze is a very powerful thing and can be used very effectively in dealing with social anxiety. In the coffee shop example, as I look around, I see normal people doing their own thing - reading books, listening to podcasts, scrolling through their phones - not the rows of judging faces pointing and laughing at me that I had let build up in my mind’s eye. This technique can be used in any anxiety-inducing situation where you have enough space to avoid yourself shrinking down under the weight of your anxious thoughts. Even if speaking in public or another situation where you feel scrutinised and unable to make exaggerated movements there are still changes you can make to bring about the same effect. For example, if speaking in public you can strike a power pose by widening your stance, leaning forward with both hands on the lectern and bringing your chin up. You can also scan the room to engage people individually with eye contact. In this way, the blurry sea of judgemental “audience” “out there”, becomes individuals with their own features and expressions. I also use it a lot on buses, trains and airplanes where I would find walking past rows and rows of seated passengers while I looked for a seat very stressful. But I find this is most effective on the subway, which i historically found a very stressful and anxiety-inducing environment. The more I would be sucked down into looking at my phone or book (which i was only pretending to engage with because I was becoming anxious - and increasingly so the more I believed people were starting to notice how uncomfortable I was) the more my thoughts would race, the redder I would get and the greater the feeling of losing control and spinning into an anxiety attack was.The spell could only be broken by “up and out, not down and down and in” - looking up, posturing up and turning my attention outwards. On subway trains now I spend a lot of the time enjoying the luxury of leisurely looking around the carriages. I try not to stare at anyone as I’m sure there are many people there with their own self-consciousness and anxiety issues that don’t want any unwarranted excessive attention. But I do enjoy the newfound ability to let my gaze roam around, register people’s faces and see that no one is out to get me or laugh at me or judge me.

I used to not make any eye contact with anyone outside and when I would come home, I would feel horrible and start to kick myself because of it. I would feel like I was missing out on life and would feel sad. I broke this habit by telling myself before going outside, \" some eye contact, even if it\\'s awkward, is better than no eye contact.\" For girls, I notice that when a cute girl comes into my line of sight I get nervous and shy away. I would look anywhere expect for them. This has been a automatic reaction for awhile, and I would feel like coward afterwards. I manually had to change this behavior. So before going outside I\\'ll tell myself \" Some eye contact with girls, is better than no eye contact.\" Last tip I can give is posture. I imagine my back against a wall when I am walking.

My friend was there with her bf and her other friend. We got along rather well. Sure enough the 4 of us got bored and went to do our own thing.

I dunno what was going through my mind (other than alco) but i did find her cute (she was indian or similar) we grinded a little as well and kept saying stupid things to one another about the place and i kept making sure not to charge across her boundaries but also break the touch barrier.. we held hands while dancing heaps. my two other friends left early and i took this chance to ask her to go for a walk.. sure enough we did and we ate shitty fast food on the way back to where ahe was staying.. at the top of the stairs i had to give her back her shoes (i was carrying them because they hurt her feet) i asked her if she wanted her shoes back and she said \"maybe, is that what you want?\" i said \"idk maybe its not\" she said \"maybe you want something else\" i said \"maybe i do\" we smiled and she leant in for a kiss snd i met it. We made out for a little bit and i said \"thats more like it\" we did it again and i hugged her around her lower back.. i told her that was my first kiss and she was kinda shocked.. then she told me hers and how it was weird.

I know even if I went out drinking/ clubbing I would not find the kind of person I would want to be around at all.

As part of a New Years resolution, I decided I was going to start saying yes to events instead of being cozied up at home all the time. I should note that I’ve been homeschooled through K-12, hence never having walked in a classroom. I won’t lie, I was really nervous leading up to, and partly during the event. I played some indie folk music on the way to try to soothe my nerves. As soon as I pull my car over the hill with the intersection, I witnessed just what I’d be getting myself into. Cars were everywhere. It was a real turn out. There were over 200 people in attendance. I find a parking spot at another building, and I’m just thinking of home. Home where I don’t have to worry about sounding stupid or accidentally having a social faux pas. I push out my chest and walk towards the line. I wasn’t expecting a line. So I mozy on to the back of the line, occasionally looking at my phone so I would blend in with most of the high school kids that were there (I’m 19 with a full beard who is out of the loop on current technology). I couldn’t get a WiFi connection, so I was just switching between settings and the browser the whole time, hopefully looking like I was doing something. The line crawls, and I’m just switching between looking up and at my phone. I make it to the walk up registration, and tell them my name and what not. It seems like it went ok. I walked up and just found the quickest seat I could so I wouldn’t have to be seen walking up by everyone. I sit down and immediately this dude asks if I play vidya games. So I tell him I play fortnite. He starts asking if I watch this particular twitch streamer, I say no. The conversation kind of fizzles out after. Wondering if I seemed boring? Moments later I hear him say to one of his friends “you want to get drunk later?”. At that moment I’m having a little bit of a culture shock. I’ve never drank alcohol. Does everyone booze in HS? I felt kind of uncomfortable. Finally the presentation begins. It’s pretty basic, and I could have got more information from the website. There is a point during the presentation where they play this website quiz game from the school. I can’t partake because my WiFi won’t work, so I just watch the results. I would have got most of them wrong if I tried. Yikes. I was taking notes, but not paying attention to the right stuff evidently. So after that, the whole room is being split off into tour groups. I am paying full attention because I don’t want to screw up and go off with the wrong group. Thankfully I do get the right one. At this point I’m standing alone with a bunch of strangers. Most are with someone else. The tour seems to go fine, there were these three really obnoxious teenagers who were fucking off for the most part though. They didn’t bother me thankfully. Our tour ends and it’s on to the last event (which I wasn’t aware of until later.) Its basically a few different stands promoting different fields of study and social events (almost none of which pertained to my major of choice or my personal interests.) I talk to a few of them anyways. I won’t lie, it was really awkward. I kept tripping over my words, speaking in broken English, and my mind went completely blank a few times while in the middle of conversations. I honestly wonder if this hurt my chances of being enrolled. I didn’t have many good questions either. Afterwards I sat at a table and fidgeted on my phone, then I realized it was for the most part over, and a wave of calm came over me. I realized I could leave! Since I didn’t have anyone to talk to, what was the point of staying any longer? So I walked a long walk back to my car and headed home. That was it. Only part worth it was touring the campus honestly. Well it wasn’t a perfect attempt at integrating into society, but it’s progress nonetheless. I’m proud that I did this instead of wondering what it would have been like at home. It was awkward and I didn’t connect with anyone. I’m afraid more will follow when I do (eventually) enroll there. I just thought I’d share his with anyone of you who is afraid of getting out of the house and in public. I still feel like an out of touch geriatric alien, but hopefully I made some progress. **TL;DR** Went to a preview day at my local community college.

Hopefully someone will read through and offer some advice or likeness. Okay, so I have been someone who suffers from social anxiety since I was about 8. Before that I was actually very outgoing and was social at my preschool/first grade/second grade. Many things contributed to my social anxiety and thus my life long battle of depression. The first notable thing was my teachers bullying me for having ADHD and telling me I was too disruptive. The second notable thing was my best friend in second grade ended up ignoring me because the popular girl in the class disliked me as I was very active and bubbly. So, that\\'s some backstory, and ever since then I have been an internet recluse. Everytime I tried to make friends they used me and then bullied me verbally and mentally until at 13 I quit going to school and outside completely. Internet gaming, specifically MMOs is all I\\'ve had since. Fast forward, I am now nearing 22. I go to college, have a job, and a boyfriend of nearly 5 years. Everything on that aspect is fine (or better than expected for now) but...I fucked myself over socially. When I was 16 I made a friend group despite my social anxiety. The internet is easier to socialize on for me, even though I still can\\'t order a pizza over the phone or make a Dr. Appointment irl. I\\'ve had these friends since 16 for a very stable period, but last year I had a complete social anxiety attack and went haywire. I removed everyone, blocked them, and vanished for 2 months. I tried to come back and explain what happened, but no one was having it. One friend who was very close, even responded \"lol good\" when she heard I was struggling. I tried to reach out people to ask why I was being treated this way and they would get mad at each other for telling me something and then I got backlash for trying to reconnect and put the pieces of my social life back together. This has been extremely debilitating for me and I have relapsed to my pre-social ways. I apologized and told them I\\'d stop bothering them, to which they never responded to except that they didn\\'t need the drama. What bothers me most is that to make these friends, I put myself out there and listened to when THEY were upset. I specifically remember two of them were genuinely suicidal and I talked them through their troubles. One of them said she won\\'t speak to me because I am only trying to talk to her because no one else will and I need someone. Well....yeah. Is this not what normal friends do? Anyways, I apologized to them all and removed them because I was only a bother and annoying. I keep having small breakdowns and it\\'s leaking out in my relationship and work. Today at work the assistant manager seen me act very atypical and asked me if I was okay to which I kind of laughed in a hollow tone and said no and walked away. Everyone at work noticed and I started having an anxiety attack mid rush (I work at a pizza place so it can get work heavy on weekends). What do I do now? Has anyone else experienced this and has found a way to cope or just experienced this in general? I want to make new friends...but I just feel like a teen again and like everyone hates me.

Im 16, male, suffer from GAD since I was 3 yo got diagnosed with it when I was 8 or 9. This past summer I saw many changes with my behaviour and thought they were normal, because of puberty and such. Now Im sure it isnt just puberty. Today I went to the store to buy a new pair of earbuds, mine broke and listening to music helps with my anxiety. I was on foot and during the 7 mimute walk to the store I was starting to get sweaty, I was thinking what to say to shop assistant and I was afraid of someone recognising me and I had to make a small talk with them. I get to the store, a big one inside a mall. I get there and the first thing I see were the earbuds, but they werent those that I wanted, searched and couldnt find the earbuds that I wanted, I wanted to get as quickly as possible so I grabbed one of those and headed towards the counter to buy them. The shop assistant was talking to 2 women and I was afraid of interrupting them, I give the earbuds to another shop assistant that was next to the other shop assistant that was talking to the women. He was doing something else but I put the earbuds on top of the counter without saying anything, the guy saw that I wanted to buy the ear buds and gave them to the lady that was talking to the women. The woman was slowlying writting on the keyboard with 2 fingers and talking to the women, during this, I was sweating and shaking, and I was looking at the store, I saw the earbuds that I wanted on my right and I had missed them when I was first looking for the earbuds. I take one of the earbuds and placed them on top of the counter, the shop assistant didnt see the earbuds that I wanted on top of the counter, I had to talk to the shop assistant that I wanted to change the product, few words, was quick and quiet while shaking and sweating. She did what she had to do and I took the money out of my wallet shaking to give the lady. I put them in my backpack and walk, almost running to home thinking that I was way too akward and that they saw me shaking and sweating, got home and started writting this. I go the shrink about my GAD but never mentioned my anxiety while on these situations. Im too afraid, my parents judge me for not hangging out much with my peers, they compare me to them when they were my age and I sometimes get grounded because they think that I am additcted to my pc and phone, which I am not, and that addiction is making me hang out less with my friends. My shrink knows my parents really well, she was my dad's shrink for when he had depression, it was on that time that I was diagnosed with GAD. At the end of each session my shrink talks to my dad or my mom about the session amd Im afraid my parents will judge me after the session, at home. What should I do?

            "{'sequence': '(\\'Everyone hates me and what I\\'ve learned from it. This is going to be a weird post and hopefully it fits here well. I never thought of this as a social anxiety, but it actually is kind of, correct me if I\\'m wrong I\\'m new to Reddit. I\\'ve been hated. Even since preschool. Not by my family by all means, and people liked members of my family by the way. It seemed like people only outside of my family hated me. Strangers, classmates, coworkers, anyone I came into contact with besides my family hates me. I was always the quiet one and the weird one. I never minded either. I fed off of their hate. Anytime I got bullied I would fight back. Like you know when they say fight or flight? Yea I was the fighter. I would lash out and do exactly what they did to me. Or I would cry and show them exactly how it made me feel right then and there, almost as a joke but filled with rage. I didn\\'t really get embarrassed. I was really good at doing embarrassing things and be okay with it most of the time. I preferred to be alone. I never liked it When people tried to become my friend. Like why are you texting me and calling me? Please leave me alone. For some reason I did actually become friends with the other unliked kid. I would see people snicker at them and see them as weird. Here\\'s a little story: There was one girl in middle school. Her name was Jane. She had long black hair, pale skin and bright hazel eyes. The kids were literally afraid of her and thought she was weird I wasn\\'t afraid of her and I was fascinated in her. I also felt empathy for her. I could relate to her of being unliked. End of short story. Weird part about enjoying being alone is I\\'ve always had a boyfriend since the beginning of high school. The boyfriends were always cool and well liked by others. The boyfriends were all similar in their own ways, we all broke up mutually, calmly and on good terms. The boyfriends all gave me respect, friendship and trust. The cool boys always liked Jane as well and she always had a cool boyfriend too! Other boys thought we were the \"funniest, raddest, coolest, best to be around\" chicks out there. Or so they say. So I guess what I should have said in the beginning of this entire post is, most girls hate me. So truth be told, not everyone hates me. This has been a lie for my whole life. I believed as a small child up until early adulthood is that everyone hated me was far from the truth. One day I had enough. I tried to kill myself. Slit my wrists and wanted to bleed out. Well it didn\\'t work, I didn\\'t die and I should have gotten stitches. So I decided that day I will never try again left with awful scars. I still hated my life and the fact everyone hated me. I fell again in these ideas I created. Sure there was hard proof for people hating me. They hated the way I looked, the way I dressed, my hair. They spread rumors, they prank phone called me, tried to best me up. I had a girl send me a 10 page text message saying I lie about every story I ever told her . The words this girl said to me hurt me deeply. I cried and cried. I worked with her and I had to face her. I was terrified of her and I wondered \"why me\" It was a pattern. Some girls simply just didn\\'t like me. There was nothing I could say or do any differently. You might be thinking, \"there has got to be a reason why people hate me.\" The only thing I can think of to answer that thought, would be that I am totally myself. I don\\'t sugar coat shit. I\\'m honest and I like to share ideas and past expieriances. So here is a little description about me to paint a better picture. I try hard with things I do. I really enjoy practicing different skills and hobbies that strike my interest suddenly such as painting, playing instruments, gymnastics, yoga, hiking, biking, dog training, cooking, singing and more. If something interests me I try it. You could say I\\'m a go getter. At the same time I\\'m laid back, I\\'m quiet and a keep to myself person. Other times I am wacky and weird. I sing and dance to myself, I talk to myself. I do weird things. I make jokes and I laugh at things. I am over the spectrum of things. I am ever changing. I am confused but I am aware. I am always looking around me and thinking people are planning things. I avoid people. Other times I truely care about people. I love people and I love seeing their talents. I want to get to know them and I listen to them. I always see people and notice their intentions. You could say I am observant. But all of this I still enjoy being alone. I guess I live a balanced life. I\\'m also a Libra and my life seems to match up to those horoscopes most of the time to also paint a picture of myself. So instead of rambling on and on and on as I\\'m surprised if anyone is even still reading this, I\\'m going to get straight to the point. I\\'ve learned a lesson in life and it is difficult to grasp!! The lesson is, no one actually truely cared about me all along but myself. It was me all along that cared too much about what people thought. It was my reactions towards situations that hurt me and made me think people hate me. I have to come to terms that I am simply an imperfect human being with odd characteristics as everyone else! We are all so unique and in our own little worlds. We all work differently and that\\'s how we all fit together just as a puzzle and how each piece is unique and all work together. Sometimes it takes a while for the pieces to come together and sometimes they seem to fit but they don\\'t really work well and you can\\'t actually fit them perfectly. Sometimes different pieces in the puzzle need to be as far away as possibly to work perfect and help complete the picture. It is okay to not get along with everyone but when they show their dislike I need to keep calm and carry on. What I mean by our own little worlds is, everything around us is determined by our own judgements and the way we see things around us. We all see things differently, our brains work differently and you can clearly see we are all different so that proves our own little worlds. We all automatically look out for our own well being. So my whole life I was thinking too hard about what people thought of me. Once someone expressed their slight 2 second care about me, my reaction made me believe that everyone hated me. It was a delusion. I had a chain reaction because once I believed everyone hates me my actions and reactions more than likely changed that held characteristics that are easy to dislike by other people. Hopefully out of all of this rambling is that I can continue to realize these thoughts of mine and start to have a better attitude towards life. I hope I can bring light and new helpful ideas to the world. I strive to be the best I can for myself and others. I will react to others even when they do me wrong as a calm and collected individual. I will handle my fight instinct as a normal human in complete control. I will continue to just be myself and let others be themselves.\\')', 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with positive effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect', 'outdoor activity or space with negative effect'], 'scores': [0.3591376543045044, 0.3395673930644989, 0.30129489302635193]}\n",

Tuesday I left my house with the intent of going but about midway through I just started panicking and instead walked around the city so my family didn\\'t start suspecting of anything. I swear I never walked as much a I did that day it was pathetic, and all because I\\'m afraid to go to class. That was when I decided that I wouldn\\'t go at all that week and instead I\\'d prepare myself and today I\\'d be in a changed man an all the fear and anxiety would be gone.

In high school I had 2-3 really close friends including my main best friend lets call her BFF, and a bunch of other friends mainly just people I talked to and hung with in school and class but was never truly close with. So my bff and I were super close all of high school until about the end of march when she basically ditched me for a new group of friends she made. We would still talk and I was her “best friend” but once she started hanging out with her new friend group she never included me, stopped telling me about important thing going on in her life, etc and overall just acting really snobby and conceited. I ended up confessing to one of the other girls I was really close with what was happening, and she was by my side and supported me. My bff and I ended up talking everything through and were good but things didn’t really change. She kept hanging out with them at all times never including me and when I did hang with them (once) she barely spoke to me the entire time. After we graduated she had two weeks in our city before she had to go away and start summer semester at a college far away but still in the same state. She spent the whole two with her new friend group and only gave me one day to hang out 3 days before she had to leave. During this time I was at my dad’s house and was so pissed that she would do this to me that I was not going to leave my dads house just so she could see me when she had all this time to and didn’t. Summer goes along and we didn’t talk not even once. At this point in my life I had decided to start school in the spring to give myself some time because I felt that I needed it and my only two friends were the girl that helped me out with my bff and her best friend who was also my friend. The entire summer we barely hung out. After summer we hung out a couple times but they were all super boring. I’m personally very outgoing and a hyped up type of person when I’m around people I feel comfortable with. They would just sit there and not want to do anything fun or engaging. I don’t mean get drunk and party all night, but like go makeup shopping or play fun stupid games, go out to eat, talk about boys, go shopping, go to the beach, or in general anything besides like going to one of their houses and playing nintendo wii. Plus on top off all this they were very judgy and would look at me weird for saying something outside of the box. When I would ask one of them about the boys in the college I was going to go to in the spring she would be dry and uninterested. Then in October I got a job, and I really like the place I work at. When we would hang out and I would try to tell them about the people and like the tea going on at work they didn’t care and I would talk and they didn’t respond and I felt like I was talking to my self. All of this plus the fact that since they were each others best friend they wouldn’t include me in a lot of their convos and then bring up things when I was there made me feel really lonely and tired. Eventually was broke the camels back was that drama basically started again with my bff and when I texted them I was just going to text her and end this once and for all they both started sending messages like “oooohhh can’t wait for the tea” or “🐸☕️”, “the tea it hot” and in general things like that. I was so offended because instead of being there for me and supporting me bc they both knew how hurt and emotionally affected I was from the situation between my bff and I all they cared about was the tea and the drama. A month after this happened I cut them off but only talked to one of them. It was the one that helped me in the beginning with my bff. I thanked her for supporting and that I was always going to be grateful for that but that our friend ship was over and I explained to her how they made me feel and basically she texted me back cursing me out and saying a whole bunch of rude shit and I never texted her again. Both of them blocked me on all social media platforms and I have not seen, heard, or talked to them since that day. I started college but online bc I have no transportation to campus so I have no interactions with people my own age and at my job it’s mainly middle aged women and a few young people but not anyone I consider to have a good connection friendship wise with. It gets me so sad to see my ex bff on social media going to parties and having fun, making friends, etc. when I wish I was doing that. Plus just in general watching young people my age having fun and hanging out with their “squad” makes me depressed! Because I want that. Now because of my friendless life and because I have little to no interaction with people my own age in over a year I’m beyond scared to do school on campus so I’ve decided to do all of college online. I’ve definitely gotten a lot anxiety in regards to being social with people my own age and also boys. I’ve never had a boyfriend or even talked to anyone and with my whole lonely no friends no social life situation I’m never going to meet one and if I do, I mentally I’ve already sabotaged myself because I think to myself how embarrassing it would be to meet a boy and when he asks about my friend me tell him that I have none. Like how fucking embarrassing and lame does that sound. So to avoid this Im just not gonna let any potential guy get close enough. Plus I’m insecure about my body bc Im a little chubby but don’t do anything to change this because I have zero motivation. So far the only good things going for me are my job, school, and my immediate family. I get depressed when I think about the fact that I’m so young and I have no friends anyone to hangout with and have normal social interactions with. Like am I really going to waste all of my young years stuck in my house all day and working as much as possible.

I suffer from social anxiety disorder and I've had the oh so typical social anxiety thought that people hate me lately. I have a specific friend who my attention has been on lately because he really doesn't talk that much to me, almost forgot to say hello to me when he arrived to this party (even though that's probably not true, alot of people there to say hello to) I know for a fact that this is like the nicest guy that exist in the world, but my brain is a wierdo so.. Should also add that he is a few steps above acquaintance level. There had been some quite heavily alcohol intake from everyone at this party and sometime during the night me and a friend decide to take a walk around the neighborhood and he decides to come with. I tell my friend about this feeling about him hating me (2nd time, have talked about it before and she says that's not the case). This situation ends up with me deciding it's a great time to tell him how I feel. My friend ends up telling him that I feel this way with my permission (He also doesn't know I have anxiety or any problems btw). He then comes over and of course tells me that's absolutely not the case. I suddenly break down crying and hyperventilating in his arms and we talk it out as best we can (we are alone at this stage). My friend then gets back and in my drunk state I pretty much word vomit out a confusing summary of my history with anxiety and my current state to them. We keep on walking the three of us and he keep comforting me with kind words, small hugs and back touches until we arrive back at the party with me now close to anxiety free. I'm now a little confused about this. I'm honestly glad I told him, it feels like it got rid a little bit of the whole thought about people hating me. I also feel guilty that I brought another person in to my anxiety. I sent him a message this morning apologising about that he had to see that and that I put him in this position, and he said everything was cool and I believe him. I honestly thought I would have more anxiety about this but a big part of me just laughs at this whole situation which is wierd. So this is just a little bit of a vent from a hungover girl.

Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been super shy. I don’t know why. Nothing happened to me as a child, I have a great family and have great friends so I don’t know why I have this debilitating issue. I looked it up, and i learned that sometimes people with an overactive amygdala have a heightened fight or Flight response therefore causing more severe anxiety. So maybe it’s a biological thing for me, but I have thought of anything at all that could have affected me to be like this but nothing comes to mind. Throughout middle school, I haven’t even realized but In seventh grade I was depressed. I don’t think I knew it. I knew I was sad but didn’t know if it went further than that. I don’t remember being suicidal then, but seventh grade was the first time I started to self harm. I was always getting in trouble with my parents, I’ve always felt like they’re out to get me and I never show or receive any affection. Because of this, me and my parents relationships is not the best. and I know it’s my fault. They try to understand why I act certain ways but I don’t even know myself. I wish I had an answer. So anyway, an incident happened in seventh grade where I had to share something with the class. Presentations always scared me and being in front of the class always did. Even if it was a simple yes or no question. I can’t stand being the center of attention and I always cry when I feel this social anxiety coming on. We had to share poems we had written and I just remember being so scared, I just started crying and couldn’t get through it. I remember my classmates faces and they were so confused and I was confused to. I knew it was just a presentation but my body had another idea. To this day I’m not sure if that was my first anxiety attack? and I’m not sure if I’ve ever had an anxiety attack because I never feel like the world is ending I just get so embarrassed I think, that all I can do is cry and my heart starts beating rapidly, and I’m shaking and I just wanna disappear. But do people have anxiety attacks differently? If you know, please help. Anyway, after that happened I was SO mortified I didn’t even want to go back to school. I always assumed people labeled me as the super shy freak girl and wouldn’t want to talk to me anyway so I decided to do virtual school in eighth grade. No one knows that’s the reason I decided to be homeschooled. I just tell everyone “I don’t know just felt like it” when they ask because I don’t want to tell them my embarrassing story. So virtual school actually turned out to be awful and so I ended up starting high school for 9th grade as a freshman. Because I skipped out on 8th grade, I already didn’t have many friends. And the ones I did have, lets call her Lauren. She was my absolute best friend and we ended up having a class together so that was the class I looked forward to. I remember always being isolated in my other classes while everyone else talked and I would be so scared around people and scared that someone would talk to me. I didn’t have many friends that year. I also repeatedly cut and I was developing an addiction. Come sophomore year, I was deeply depressed. My best friend, still Lauren, she glew up. She became popular and gorgeous and it was hard being friends with her sometimes because she had so many friends and guys all over her. I know it wasn’t her fault of course, and through it all she stuck by me and I couldn’t be more grateful to have someone like her to this day. But I can’t Help but feel inferior when I’m with her sometimes. I would always think “people are probably wondering why she’s friends with you” “they just think you’re a charity case” I was so quiet all the time. I honestly don’t remember much of sophomore year. I just remember being sad all the time. I remember drawing sad sketches. I discovered and became obsessed with twenty One pilots, (still my favorite band today and I’m seeing them this year FLOOR TICKETS! can’t wait haha.) so come junior year, I told myself if I wasn’t happier by the end of the year I would kill myself before senior year. I met my other best friend junior year and we are so similar it’s crazy. So greatful for her friendship. Still struggled with self harm. I started to maybe get a little better, or so I thought I was. I got my first job at Burger King, which was not the wisest decision. Smoked weed and got high for the first time. Developed a huge crush on a boy who did nothing but lead me on. It really wrecked me and I don’t think he has any idea of how much to this day. Pierced my nose. I think I kept trying new experiences to feel something, convince myself to stay. I thought it was working but deep down, I was the same. Didn’t self harm as much because it wasn’t as easy to hide anymore. And my mom found out a little later and everything just got a bit crazy. Forced into therapy and parents found a pipe and new I was smoking. They were absolutely furious. I also was caught with a boy over at like 2 am by my mom. Not my finest moment. I think this was definitely my most impulsive year. I started to do things that scared me and that I knew was wrong but I think I was just trying to fill the void I had. One night I decided I had enough and tried to overdose on vistaril. I remember feeling the effects of it and becoming super tired so I thought that was it. I went to bed peacefully. Well, spoiler, I woke up. I was so mad I hadn’t taken enough but I think I was also relieved. I read about liver damage and all that and I decided that if I was going to do it again, I would take enough so I wouldn’t end up in the hospital impaired all my life. So summer before senior year, my best friend, Lauren, invited me to a church camp. I’ve always been a Christian and such but never had a relationship with God. That camp was a turning point for me. I met so many people and developed so many friendships and it opened my eyes to a life I wanted to live. And for the first time, I felt like I had support. People who were there for me and like I had God. But my depression still didn’t go away. I was still sad. So so sad. One of the hardest things I’ve ever done, is opened up and told my feelings of depression and suicidal ideation to. One night at the camp, it was the last night and we were all in this big room sharing stories or just venting things we needed to get off of our chest. Telling people things we needed prayer for. I told everyone In that room, maybe 60 people, my plans of killing myself. How I was going to before senior year but that this camp changed my mind. And I could barely get through it without crying. After that, a lot of people came to hug me and tell me to stay strong and that they were there for me. It was an amazing and cool experience. But I started attending church with her and becoming stronger in my faith and I connecting with amazing people. I went to Guatemala in 2017 on a mission trip and it was an amazing experience. Everything was as good as could be. I just wanted to be done with High school and done with my past there. I was ready for college and what life had for me. I can’t believe it, but I was dare I say hopeful. I felt guilty for being anxious and depressed as a Christian though. It of course, was no where as near as bad as it was but I still woke up and felt that same emotionless i felt for so long and tiredness. Soon enough, I just accepted it. People think that because I have Jesus now that I’m okay. But inside I am still hurting and depressed. I think about suicide almost everyday but I would never act on it. I know God is there for me and would never want me to do this, his plans are always greater. And I believe that, I do. I went to Montreal on a mission trip this past November and it was awesome. I love helping people and showing gods love and although it’s hard to connect with people sometimes due to social anxiety, i know I’ll get through it. But still depression lingers. I worked at chick fil a for a bit but quit due to anxiety and the amount of people there and all. I try daily to get back up. I need a job but I’m scared to get one just to become over whelmed and quit again. I keep letting people down. I still want to die. I wish I could just go peacefully. I feel like a ghost among the living and I’ve always felt like something Is wrong with me. I’m on meds and I always dream of overdosing but I could never. I have a tattoo dedicated basically saying “this may suck but God’s still got you”. It’s “And if not, he is still good”. I got that tattoo and wrote my testimony about having social anxiety and living through it. I feel like a hypocrite for feeling like I want to die still. I always encourage others and tell them that it does get better and to hold on and I hope they believe me when I say it and can’t see behind my mask. I think I believe it when I say it to them. But for some reason my mind makes me believe that I will never succeed and I’m bound to live a purposeless life. Everyday I wake up and I say just another day to exist. Just doing my classes and occasionally meeting up with friends. I feel like I’m lying to them. No one knows how I feel am I’m ashamed to tell them. I don’t want them to take pity on me and I don’t want to treated like I’m going to break if they touch me. I am in a new relationship. My first boyfriend, and he is the sweetest most amazing thing. But I’m scared to tell him how I feel. I warned him of my depression and anxiety but I didn’t tell him the extent of it. He doesn’t know I self harm. Which I did for the first time in about 6 months yesterday. He saw and I told him it was the cat. Lame excuse and I don’t think he bought it. I’m torn between scared of telling him and him not wanting to deal with this or just tell him because he was going to leave anyway. either way I lose. it’s best to be honest right? Anyway. I know this is super long so thanks for reading if you did. Any comments / suggestions / advice is welcome. Thanks.

I will try to ´´summarize´´ this (at the bottom, there is a real summary). As a child, when i was around 11, i was really attractive to everyone. I know this because at school, i got all the girls chasing me, and so outside. Obviously, i was too young to ´´benefit´´ on this. At that age, i remember myself as an outgoing kid, that had friends and did some regular stuff. Later on, something happened. I think that the inflection point was the haircut that i started wearing, the classic mushroom haircut that a lot of kids wear...with the difference that i was a teenager already. From being a young Adonis, i started to hear the mock of some girls, through the nicknames that they put on me, refered to my haircut. All my friends started having some interactions with girls, while i was just staring, too afraid of rejection. That was the beginning of my fearful existence, and it continued (with ups and downs) until my current age of 25. So yeah, right now i feel like i didnt live at all. I never had a girlfriend, i only have 1 friend that i meet every few months, i never had a job and never been to a party. This decade has been a mix of playing World of Warcraft, doing sport (cycling and calisthenics, obv individual sports), and studying some random useless shit that my mother suggested me to. I feel like it doesnt matter what i study, since there is people in almost every single profession. Ive studied hostelry and quitted it cos its too customer-facing. Ive studied sport and physical activity animator...but it was only because i like to practice it, im too insecure for teaching or doing anything in fron of a group. Now i switched to programming...but seems that im too autistic even for the nerd-world, since the teacher already told me that i have to learn to participate more while working in a groupal project...but i just end up excluding myself. Sport is what saved me through all this time. When im at home, i cant stop thinking about the past and the future, and i listen a lot of depressing music. So i need to take a ride on my bike almost every day. Im prety good at it and its hard to think about random shit when you are under big physical effort. I consider myself a good interlocutor, but i only can show this in individual conversations. In a group (specially if i dont know the members), im unable to articulate a single word unless someone ask my oponion directly. This is hard for me, because everybody that ever meet me, told me that im a very witty person and i can contribute to the conversation. Im really quick at making word games. Somebody once told me that i should try rap battles. And i would...if i could articulate a fucking word in front of groups of strangers -.-º. Because of this witty personality, i know that people want me in their groups, and i got invited to random plans and parties many times...but always refused. I just cant stop thinking about little details that throw me back: what if i have to dance, what if they wanna take photos, what if my clothes are not suitable...And so, for me, saturday is just another weekday to play WoW and do some sport... I once challenged myselft to go to a psychologist. Since the first session was free and it was one to one conversation, i thought i had no excuse. It went pretty well, she got really interested in me, because we talked for an hour and a half (the session had one hour) and she even invited me to come for another free session and to pay whatever amount i could for the next ones. Not to vary, i rejected... As to relationships, ive always been on this dating webs, but it has been useless because my profile photos sucks. I hate being photographed, i dont want to recognize myself on the pics(i think im much better in person) .I always have the same 3 pics from a specific angle and blurry. I consider myself pretty good at flirting, but if the profile pic is not attractive, u wont get the chance to start a conversation. And so, i didnt meet a single girl this way. Well...i actually met one. It was on a social anxiety forum. We exchanged numbers. I could see her picture, but she couldnt see mine, so everything was ok xD. She was really pretty, which surprised me(even more, when i discovered that she had like 1k followers on IG). We chatted for a week straight, it was amazing. One day, she asked me to meet in real life, which is really hard for me, but after those conversations, i thought there was feeling between us, so i accepted. We met in a bar. She was really beautiful irl, but not as perfect as in those IG pics, which i liked even more. At first, we were kinda nervous, but the beer made its effect and we talked for hours.It was getting late and she suggested me to pass the night in my house. Im naive, but i think i know what this kind of proposition means...Still it was a terrible idea, cos i live with my mom. Dont know how and why, i ended up accepting. Before arriving to my house, i thorowed up(cos i smoked, and that makes me sick most of the times). Once in my house, my mom woke up...Well, we ended up sleeping on the same bed, but nothing could have happened cos i was too wasted X_X. Surprisingly, she wanted to keep meeting with me, and we met one more time, a few months later. The most remarkable about this one, is that we kissed. It was a really quick and cold experience, so i dont even consider it as i ever kissed. The fact that she kissed me (obv it was she who went for it) without passion, meant a lot for me. The next day, i told her to break up, because i was getting feelings, and she told me that she only was looking for friendship. She insisted in meeting again, but i rejected. That was the last time i had something with a girl, two years ago. And this is how i learned that u cant have social anxiety and 1k followers on IG by posting pics of your body. Ive cried a lot after that break up, and now im again on that numb state that everything is bad, but not enough to cry... How do i know that i have body dysmorphia. Simple: because im the supreme textrovert. I feel very secure when it comes to written comunication (more on my native language). I consider myself good at flirting (i know how to tease) and i use to troll a lot (even whole groups of people), specially the people that cry about their situation or blame others. Everything is ok as long as they dont see a picture of me. One really strange thing is that, in videogames, i never been able to speak through a microphone, which is a requirement for doing a lot of fun stuff. So i ended up being a loner even in videogames. Add that to my completism (im obsessed with achieving everything that is achievable in the games (and irl too)). Overall, i think i have a really great body, specially because i practiced several sports for more than ten years, Im 1.85 height, 70kg with very lean muscles and long legs. My hair is of an amazing quality and my haircut now is an upgraded version of the mushroom style that i think began everything xD. It makes me look younger. I dont like a lot of things about my face, but i think it has some personality. And down there, im slightly over the average. On the other hand, lets talk about what i dont like and what keeps me locked in this mental prison. I dont like my short arms, it makes me feel inferior in some sports (i feel like i have to be the best in everything). I actually started thinking that people with short arms are doomed, or something like that :/. I dont like my nose and how it looks when i smile (thats why i never smile in photos) I dont like how my hair looks when its wet, and the fordyce spots on my lips. I got the fordyce spots down there, too. They are harmless small white sebaceous bumps under the skin. Despite being well endowed, i focus more on the spots and the form of my D, which i dont like neither. Ive been watching porn for more than ten years, and it changes yourself physically and mentally. I cant stop comparing myself to the men that appear on the videos. I know almost everything about my conditions and my ´´flaws´´, because ive been reading shit about them for too long. The conclusion is that there is no magical solution, u just have to accept yourself. I read a lot about spirituality, too. Thats why i know that my goal in this life is to trascend this extreme identification with the body. To kill the ego, to live in the moment...but God, its been more than ten years and i didnt perceive much progress...I even know the techniques (meditation, self love affirmations, etc), but i end up thinking about the bad things. I still have hope, tho, and dont even contemplate suicide, because i would have to learn the lesson on the next life. Jesus, its tooking me the whole weekend to write this...with huge breaks, of course. Im such a perfectionist that i have to think a lot before before writing a line, then rewrite it...and i dont even like the final result. If you made it here: congratulations, you really deserve a prize xD! Here is the summary of this bible. I feel that i have a lot of amazing attributes, Physically im very fit because ive been practicing differen sports for more than ten years. Ive got a strong personality and witty sense of humor, as people say. Im good at flirting, too. But i just can show it. I isolate myself every time, reject invitations to social plans and let go a lot of chaces. I do this because im terrified of other peoples judgements, specially towards my body (in the supreme textrovert). Im very insecure sexually because of the classic fordyce spot issue. Now the real questions. Does anyone identify to this? Did anyone overcome a similar situation or have any advices? Do anyone wanna share his story?

Speaking of college, I have a bachelors degree in English (I know) I am currently unemployed and my last two jobs were in non profit academic advisory roles. I was pretty much a loner and hated school throughout life. I was taken to a therapist when i was 12, and they declared I was \"normal.\" I started questioning life in college and realized it was pretty useless and that it was school and work until you die. I drank liquor i would say the normal amount for a college student. After graduating, I took the two advisory jobs which I hated both jobs due to anxiety. I am not a people person in general and I would sweat profusely when talking to students or even in mildy hot temperatures. I sweat 10x more than others even in the winter. I would sweat in a crowded subway or platform or talking to new people. I spoke to a doctor and I was prescribed robinul and told I had hyperhydrosis. The robinul works so that part of my life is solved temporarily. In addition to this, no matter what allergy medicine I take or what dose, I drip water from my nose and eyes. If I go outside especially in the morning, and its sunny or windy, my eyes water. I get acid reflux and heartburn from tomato sauce, coffee and liquor (all things I love). I also find myself getting extremely angry at the simplest things (people walking slow in the city, etc, to the point where I think about attacking someone in my head.) When I began feeling suicidal at my first job after graduation, I spoke to a therapist again who once again told me I was \"normal\" a \"regular new yorker\". At this point I am at a wits end and speak to another doctor who prescribes me zoloft and other downers. I mix them with alcohol in a excessive amounts to cope with the job I hate. I stop taking the zoloft pretty because they didn\\'t work for me. I was taking to a hospital where people told me i was a handsome man who had things to live for and sat next to a girl with 16 cut marks on her arm and a guy who wanted to start fires with his hands. I did my research before hand and I realized that they would probably give me shock therapy (I don\\'t know how that would help) so I pretended to feel better. Fast forward to today, I am unemployed living off my parent. I work out about three or four times a week, I am about 5\\'11 195. The only problem is I have little to no appetite daily and I am starting to develop a belly. I eat maybe twice a day (where i force myself to eat),I sweat like Patrick Ewing in the fourth quarter if I don\\'t take robinul and i work out 4 times a week So this is unexplainable to me Anyway, I\\'ve had ultrasounds, endoscopy, colonscopy and the gastro doctor stated I was in perfect health and the only theory he has is ibs. As you can see, I\\'ve had a long series of issues in my body and doctors telling me everything is fine and blah blah etc. So I\\'m at a wit\\'s end. I also have gynecomastia in both nipples and it\\'s another obstacle that is annoying to deal with. I\\'m unemployed so I have no insurance to see any more doctors and i just think life is bullshit and I don\\'t want to deal with it. I have a girlfriend, who helps me want to keep living, although she keeps alluding to marriage in kids which I\\'m vehemently against. The only people that stop me from slicing my wrist\\'s are her, my mother, aunt, brother and 3 or 4 friends.

I created an action plan so I can break my journey down into manageable steps and the first step is to start studying outside of my bedroom; go to the library and be around people. It is nothing fancy, but I was always going straight back home after lectures to study so I was very rarely interacting with anyone (even if it is just eye contact) and on some days where I had no lectures, I’d be home all day on my computer. This made my social anxiety worse. Almost every day for the past 1-2 months, I have started going to the library and sitting amongst strangers which is something that always made me anxious. I could have easily put my laptop in my bag and went home – but I didn’t. Not only am I able to focus more and get work done but I am also moving forward in my social goal (no matter how small).

            "{'sequence': \"('My ultimate guide for defeating social anxiety. Hello, I’m a 16 yo male and this is (and probably will be) my only post on this Subreddit. Recently I discovered something great, and I want you to read this post because you’re probably struggling with social anxiety dominating your life like it used to do mine. Remember that „you were born into“ a society. You were raised with patterns to follow. You are scared of breaking these patterns. Scared of breaking out of society. Scared of being rejected by it. Now I want you to differentiate between SOCIETY and HUMANITY. Society is a theoretical construct. A mindset. Society is what has these rules that make you scared of being yourself(„don‘t dress differently“, „don‘t run outside when others see you“ for example.). Humanity are people. Humanity are the people around you and the people you meet. The construct of society and these rules shall not apply for now. In my school bus is always this guy. He enters as one of the last. He‘s probably as old as me. He wears plain black clothes and tries to avoid any eye contact at all. His eyes are dead. When he sits on his seat he doesn‘t even put off his bag from his back. He doesn‘t want to make noise and come off as annoying, even though the bag taking all his space clearly makes him uncomfortable and it bothers him. This guy is affected by society. Not just affected, it‘s dominating all of his actions. Of course noone would give a f*ck if he would just put off his bag, but he still has his made-up rules carved into his mind. This applied to me aswell. Perhaps you may have seen by now that society cares, but humanity clearly doesn’t. Now at one point in the last few days I found a point: „What if I disconnected from all of this?“, „What if I didn‘t care?“. Whenever I am in an anixious situation now, for example walking past a row of cars, I tell myself: „These rules don‘t apply for me now. I‘m free now.“ I‘d like to show you another example. When someone mocks you for being an idiot(let‘s say you just stumbled and fell) and you care about it, you may feel like an idiot. Even worse, you let the bully take control over your emotions. You let him take your soul. Now what if you simply wouldn‘t care? He‘s the idiot now, He keeps mocking about you. But he keeps mocking a god. You are way out of his league now. You don’t care about his existence and his words. Instead of actually feeling like an idiot and feeling he deserves the right to mock you because society says that, he‘s just being a rude child now and you don‘t have to worry about him at all. He‘s still trapped in his little society cage, and you‘re a free and respectable human now. Perhaps maybe you may still think that ignoring society patterns may make you an outsider, and make you end up as a lonely old man/woman without having ever been loved. Think of the most confident man/woman you know. Think of someone harassing him/her. The confident person would never even let the harasser close to affecting its emotions. It doesn‘t have any emotional investment at all in the people around it because society doesn‘t have it caught in its chains. Perhaps maybe the average society-affected person will not like you now, but it will respect you. On the other hand, humanity will not only respect, but love you. Once you disconnect from society you will start to attract many great new people. And it‘s way better than being in the society hole where you have to show heavy commitment everyday in order to not be rejected. I want you to disconnect from society now. Break the patterns, break the barrier. Be comfortable and confident with yourself. This movement doesn‘t take any realistic commitment, I just needs a change in your mind. When you feel anxiety in your actions, don’t care. I don’t want you to demonstrate that you don’t care, I want you to not care. There’s a big difference between showing and doing. You can still be a respectable person and respect other people while not giving a sh*t about the rules of society. I hope I have helped you with this. Keep going. P.S. Since this is my only post here I‘d like to recommend you 2 great books which really helped me on my journey: - „Models“ by Mark Manson (I originally bought this book to be more attractive to women but the book guides you through a internal development too. I highly recommend this book to women aswell) -„Can‘t hurt me“ by David Goggins (This book changed my life)')\", 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with positive effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect', 'outdoor activity or space with negative effect'], 'scores': [0.36035799980163574, 0.34586310386657715, 0.2937788665294647]}\n",

            "{'sequence': '(\\'Social anxiety holding me back in both personal and professional life. Hi everyone, this may be a bit long, but I appreciate anyone who reads even most of this!  and#x200B; Anyway, I\\'m a 24 M living in a big city. And a social anxiety sufferer. My social anxiety isn\\'t physically crippling or physiological -- my physical symptoms are usually pretty limited -- but it\\'s mental and I am an expert in avoidance. I would even say I am a \\\\*very\\\\* social and outgoing person in \"comfortable\" environments (alcohol, bars, sporting events, with friends or people I trust, etc.), but when it comes to \"uncomfortable\" environments including putting myself out there and being alone doing it, I avoid them (joining clubs/sports teams, going to events, meeting new people, talking to people at bars, etc.) altogether.  and#x200B; My social anxiety stems from insecurity and a lack of self-confidence. I wasn\\'t beat up or anything as a kid, but I grew up being bullied, condescended toward, and made fun of for my lack of height at the time -- I was one of the shortest kids in school (I\\'m 5\\'8 now and have not been insecure about this in years) -- and for being skinny and small in general as a man in a society that often sees men like that as weak and a joke. Teachers told me I couldn\\'t audition for roles because of my height, kids my age made fun of me, and adults made snide comments. All of this contributed toward deeply ingraining into my head a fundamental insecurity. I wore sweatshirts during the summer and shirts at the beach because I had terrible body image issues. From the age of like 10. **Long story short, from an early age I was very insecure, had major body image issues, and terrible self-confidence and this contributed greatly to creating my social anxiety.**  and#x200B; **Fast forward to today.** I am still skinny and small and find that the women who are into me tend to be 2-3 years younger usually because I \\\\*do\\\\* look young and small for my age. Dating can be frustrating. But, I am going to the gym, I\\'m starting to feel more confident in my body, and I know that I have had a good amount of romantic opportunities, even if it has never worked out into a relationship. I feel good about myself, have become extremely self-aware of my own insecurities and how I projected them in the past, and in general I am content. But, I still cannot get over the avoidance of social anxiety. It\\'s ingrained into my head.  and#x200B; **It has prevented me from making more friends** in a new city -- the idea of doing a Meetup or joining a club is terrifying to me. And I just avoid doing that kind of thing altogether. **It has prevented me from, say, talking to women at a bar,** \\\\*even in\\\\* a drunken state when I feel good about myself. It just takes over and I tell myself I\\'m not attractive, that I\\'m going to embarrass myself, etc. It has essentially reduced my chances of meeting women to only on dating apps. **And it also has held me back in my career and what I want to do in life**. I\\'m a deeply political person but I can\\'t network. I can\\'t bring myself to go to happy hour\\'s by myself or join political clubs or anything. I simply cannot put myself out there alone into unfamiliar situations. The thought of being awkward or having no one to talk to or being seen as ridiculous or an idiot -- these things fill my head and so avoid these situations altogether.  and#x200B; I don\\'t want to look back five years from now and not have made more friends, not have taken a risk romantically by talking to someone I didn\\'t know, and not have truly tried to pursue my political dreams. I have gone to therapy lately but the appointments are few and far in-between (once a month at best) and while it has helped me become even more self-aware, it has not helped me with, well, changing my brain chemistry. And I don\\'t want to be resigned to thinking this is just how I am going to be. I am missing out on so many opportunities from friends to partners to career/hobbies. **Above all, I am frustrated that I have all the logical solutions to this problem (Who actually cares what people think of you?), but that does nothing for what feels like an innate reaction to unfamiliar situations**. **I can be confident one moment and then crumble the next. I get rejected in some form and it just feeds into a spiral.** **This is very long and I am rambling, but thought I would find friendly ears here. Maybe people in my shoes who have suggestions and have conquered (or struggle with) the same things I have.

            "{'sequence': \"('I find a problem with every community I could become a part of. I'm 21 and this is something I struggle with a lot. It feels like most communities I have tried to be a part of have features around them that made me distance myself from being a part of that community. I understand that I am the problem in this situation and I'm probably overgeneralizing everything. Here are some examples: I enjoy casual gaming, but not enough to care about gaming news or events. I feel like a huge amount of people in the gaming community my age are overly edgy, rage a lot over games or are neckbeardy which scares me off. I also hate playing video games for hours on end, I get burnt out really easily and gamers usually like to have long sessions with each other. I drifted away from my gaming friends because the burnout from playing video games for hours at a time was too much for me. I enjoy hip hop and r andb, but a lot of the culture around this for my age is associated with people who smoke weed, drink, and go clubbing, which intimidates me as I don't like the loss of control associated with drugs and loud 'carefree' environments like clubs. I also feel like there's huge pressure to be on social media within this community. In high school I was friends with people who were into this community a lot and as they got older we drifted apart as they became clubbers and big on alcohol etc. I enjoy football, but I hate the competitiveness that comes with playing it (even socially, you'll get shouted at or made fun of for mistakes) and there is a hyper masculine/ drinking community stereotype associated with casual footballers my age. I also am terrible at football! I have always dabbled in and out of this community but as I was never very good, I didn't really get any respect, and I found playing a very high pressure scenario. All the above seem like immaturity problems, but there are other communities Ive tried to get into that I didn't have this problem with but I just didn't enjoy being a part of them. For example I have tried an art community, but I am not very good at art which made me embarassed whenever I went to the classes, and the way I think I naturally struggled to make and critique art. I also just felt very uncomfortable in this environment, which I think may be due to the fact that I'm not very passionate about art. I'm happy I at least tried though. I have tried a board game community, but I found it too nerdy for me, and I just didn't find any of the board games we played fun. I just didn't feel engaged enough and as passionate as the others were about the games, and the people in the group were all a lot older than me. I'm constantly looking for communities I can join which I will feel comfortable with. I am thinking maybe a running community. However I am worried that this problem is going to follow me everywhere since I seem to perfectionistic about who I be friends with. Like I already know I don't care about run times and stuff so I may feel out of place being surrounded by people who do care. If anyone else has dealt with this, it would be great to hear some advice.

My mind is empty... people talk for hours i cant even talk for a few secs. Idk how to start convos maybe its just online chat that sucks the blood out of me. I cant even do a small talk. Idk how to ask questions about peoples interests... they tell what they are interested in it and i just say \"cool\" or thats interesting.. my convos are so dumb and dull and boring.. i cant attract beautiful intelligent women either. Im the worst human being in this earth by definition. Movies or tv shows make me sad cause ppl in there are.super cool super smart and rich and im a loser. I feel like im not worthy getting any women.. i feel like every girl is cooler than me. Feeling they are cooler than me. How my convos should be like ? Getting to know each other?? Who am i ? What do i do to make friends? Am a really sarcastic guy? Or a bland/boring guy? Who should i be when talking to others? How do i make people close to me? Maybe i should focus less on making friends online. Im worried so much about this.. im worried about what to say next. What do couples talk about everyday and never run out of things to talk about?? My questions are boring as hell. I just get yes or no answers... my convos are always generic.. i send 100 girls messages and i still dont get replied..am i just desperate or what. No one wants to hangout with me. Im so bad at everything. I feel like i dont exist. Im nobody. Everyone ignores me. Its like i want to be popular real bad just like my friends..idk how to stop trying My family always calls me a loser.. a man with no plans or future or skills. Im so lame. Im so annoying too. No one likes me. Im a nonsense and my talks are nonsense too. No wonder any cute girl would never put any effort in me. Its because i dont deserve it. I have nothing to offer. I have no personality. Im dumb. I never fit in.. And people get to me sometimes so easily. Im not really tough or assertive or a bastard that pushes away those who are mean to him. In texting while trying so much to make girls like me or value me or at least just say hello to me i try a lot and i turn out to be weird or boring or my talks are absolute nonsense... i dont know how to talk. Idk anything. How some guys text so little to girls and girls still be interested in them? I dont have that superpower. Im not fun or cool. Am a total loser with a retarded mindset and tottaly boring/bland. Im not a badass or cool kid or a guy that people take seriously. Im invisible and no one really respects me. I always put more effort in than others.. but no one puts any effort into me. What do i do to make people like me??? But my convos are always dry or boring or bland or i run out of interesting questions to ask.. i ask questions like an interview and most times just get a Yes or no.. no one cares about me or loves me or thinks im important.. im just a stupid invisible boring nice guy.. Idk how to be interested in people, idk how to make friends...im not even interested in my self. I hate my self.. Idk who i am, idk how to realize who i am, idk how to find out who i want to be? Some role model? Like who? James bond? What are convos suppose to be like? In real life and online?? I try really hard to make people laugh. It happens when i see someone being funny.. so i try to say something funny too. It turns out bad... I have spent so much of my life trying to be noticed/valued/heard.. and trying to get people to give me attention.. there is so much anger inside my towards my self and everything around me.. Im always one to text first guess im really needy and chase others approval and please people just to be my friend.. this is pathetic and idk how to fix it.. Im not the one who people love Im not the one that people chase I have no skills Im not anyones best friend I dont get invited to anything I dont have friends irl or a GF. I have no job either.. Im not loved by anyone, not important for anyone.. Im only nice or rude. Which both are dumb and arent really a quality. But being rude is better than being nice to girls...idk who to be. I only play soccer watch movies and listen to music. These are the 3 things i do nothing more... Im not creative or funny or intelligent or charming or cool or smart or confindent or charismatic like James bond.. im worthless and i have no qualities at all..i have no personality im like a robot..i have no humour or no orginality in me. Im too typical and so none orginal sooo generic. I have no ideas or thoughts or opinions on my own. Im not smart enough to create opinions or big ideas. Im not even smart enough to create a joke. I have no clinical thinking..im not good to anything. Im basically like a servent when i talk to girls.. and i can be fooled so easily.. i cant fool people either.. even for fun.. because im like a joke to people.. maybe im just mean.. maybe i have a really big ego.. i have really passive aggressive jokes too.. idk how to get to know people, i dont know how to know people.. Im jealous of people with a lot of friends.. and jealous of those who have banter with each other or calling each other nicknames.. im invisible.. I try really hard to make friends online its like i want people to fill the hole of emptiness inside me..all i been thinking about is getting a GF. Not sure if i want it but i feel like it will fix all my problems.. do i even have problems? Idk.. Im addicted to porn i can escape but then i havs nothing to do and idk what to do to self improvement.. Im jealous of people who got girls chasing them and girls interested in them, jealous of ppl who get attention.. like i used to be worried about likes and rts...

            "{'sequence': '(\\'[LONG/VENT] My first 2 therapy sessions made me feel worse. What should I do?. 25 year old male, living with my mom alone. I\\'ve never worked in my life. Never been in a relationship. Haven\\'t had a friend IRL in 10 years, which is also the amount of time that I\\'ve avoided going outside entirely unless absolutely necessary (a handful of times.). Never really been diagnosed with anything, but I have really bad social anxiety for sure. Deep depression and personality issues, adhd, possibly autistic spectrum. Who knows. I\\'ve avoided going to therapy/doctors for my entire life due to my anxiety and negative thoughts. I would talk with people online and I would always say that I would never go to a therapist, and thought it would never help me. This was based on brief interactions that I\\'ve had with therapists online, and me looking up stuff about therapists on the internet. Recently, other physical health issues of mine got so bad that I had to go to the ER, which lead me to going to a general doctor, which lead me to finally try to find a therapist. Problem is, I\\'m poor. I only have free insurance from the government, and there\\'s only a handful of therapists in my area that take it. I looked at their profiles. A lot of them honestly made me upset and uncomfortable, so I tried calling the ones that I thought I might get along with. Every. Single. One. said they weren\\'t accepting new clients. Which lead me to my only other option, going to a \"health center\" or something like that, dunno what it\\'s called, but it\\'s the place where courts send people who have drug addictions and stuff. I didn\\'t really have an option and they basically just automatically assigned me a therapist. I felt very uncomfortable with the idea of it. I don\\'t get along with people very well in general. I have a very low tolerance, but I\\'m so horrified of expressing my negative and rude thoughts out of fear for rejection. I really wanted to be able to choose someone that I thought would fit me well, but I still forced myself to give it a try anyways. I had this picture in my mind of how it would play out. I would come in, sit down. He would ask me questions and try to figure me out, understand my issues. I would try to open up, but mostly fail because I\\'m so anxious and I\\'m really bad at expressing myself. He would give hid input, professional advice, or \"help\", that would just upset and trigger me because I feel like it\\'s just generalized advice for \"normal\" people that\\'s not addressing the root cause of my issues. I would reject the help, repeatedly, until the therapist got sick of my rejection that they got rid of me and sent me to someone else. The fear of being rejected like that is so great that... It just makes it so hard to express my real thoughts and what I think. Anyways, what actually happened when I went to therapy... I guess it was what I expected and also not what I expected... what I expected was to be asked more questions, like he would make attempts at trying to figure me out or understand me, and that didn\\'t happen very much. I tried talking about some of my issues anyways, and he said a lot of things that really upset me deeply, but I didn\\'t feel comfortable expressing out of fear of upsetting him/him rejecting me. There was a lot of \"Learn to love yourself\"/accept yourself/accept negative beliefs/be mindful/cbt kind of comments and ideas that he said. I don\\'t know. I don\\'t really feel it addressed my issues very well. I really didn\\'t want to go the second time, despite the first one making me feel worse. I hoped that after going to the first session, that I would have just a tiny bit of relief, and a tiny bit of hope that MAYBE I could improve and work towards getting better, but it left me feeling more hopeless. I didn\\'t want to go the second time, but it was more of the same basically. It\\'s really hard for me to recall most of the things he said as I have a really bad memory, but most of it upset me and I suppressed my triggered feelings of anger and upset, again out of fear of being rejected and referred away. He talked about quicksand in analogy to struggles, and about how the more you fight against it, the more you sink, and you just need to calm down and just accept the issues and just let them be there. My mind screamed at me, NO!!!!!! I need help with my issues. I can\\'t just accept this. I can\\'t accept how of a miserable spot I\\'m in right now. I\\'m so fucking hopeless. I want to improve, not just sit around accepting and sitting in my misery. He talked about how he believes that everyone is fundamentally \"good enough\" and \"Okay\", which at my core I deeply disagree with. I definitely don\\'t feel good enough, and have so many areas that I need to improve upon, and need help with improving on. I feel like he did more talking than I did as well, and that he didn\\'t really want to seem to ask much questions or try to figure me out... is that normal? I want my issues to be addressed and I don\\'t feel like they are being addressed. And I don\\'t know if it\\'s just my anxiety, but the interactions with him were so awkward and unbearable, but that\\'s just how I am in social situations in general, all social interactions feel awkward and unbearable to me so I don\\'t know if that was him or me. I scheduled a third appointment coming up this Friday, in hope that maybe it will somehow turn around and change, and start slowly helping me instead of making me feel worse and more hopeless when I go. I don\\'t really feel have any options. I\\'m so absolutely stuck in life right now. I\\'m so hopeless and I don\\'t know what to do. I feel like I need help, but so far I don\\'t feel like this is helping, and I don\\'t fee like it could help, and I don\\'t know what could possibly help me. All I know is that this isn\\'t so far and I don\\'t know what to do. I don\\'t know how therapy is supposed to go in the first place, or what to look out for, or what to expect from it, but I should feel like I\\'m getting SOME kind of benefit out of it, right? Is it normal to feel this negative towards it at first? I know how unstable and negative I can be... maybe it\\'s just me getting in my own head, but maybe therapy isn\\'t right for me and maybe I should jump ship? I just don\\'t know what to do.

I think I may or may not have overheard that she might be dating someone and so I\\'m like 90% she is but not 100% certain.  andnbsp; She\\'s so incredibly cute and I really wish I was able to talk to her and express myself a bit better around her.

She\\'s initiated random conversations with me several times, and I always respond positively, and sometimes it even seemed like she would go out of the way to talk to me. One time I was walking forward and she walked right past me and I was gonna say hi awkwardly like I normally do, but she walked right by, then she turned back and said \"hey how are you doing kevin?\", and she seemed really interested. I always just default to saying \"good how are you\", and she ended up saying \"i\\'m doing really good\" and honestly just seemed super excited but the conversation kind of just ended since I didn\\'t know what else to say and she was like awkwardly walking backwards back to her desk while tripping and regaining balance on her foot lol. We also went on an after-lunch walk together and we had a really fun chat (we both just happened to go out walking at the same time).  andnbsp; Every time I see her when we walk by like going to the cafeteria, at most I just awkwardly say hi and that\\'s it.

I pay attention to how she acts to me and am hopelessly hoping and overthinking everything she does that might indicate that she possibly likes me too, when it\\'s incredibly unlikely.

I’ve never spoken out about my problems, and I’m not sure why I’ve come to reddit of all places but I’m just really hoping someone will listen to me and maybe understand... Basically my entire life has been revolved around making my mother happy, or her dictating what I can and can’t do. She always emailed my teachers when I was in elementary, middle, and even high school. She didn’t believe I could say what I needed to say or get the help if I didn’t understand something. She had an app that would show her my grades, and anytime I’d get a bad grade I knew that she was going to scold me. Now I fear that I will fail, and I do not know how to cope with failure at all. Whenever I’ve had boyfriends in the past she has always hovered over us 24/7. At 18 I decided to go to the movies with my best friend (he happens to be a guy but our relationship is strictly platonic). In the middle of the movie she turns on the find my iphone alert. Everyone in the theater turns to me because the alert sound is so loud. I have to run outside because I’m so embarrassed. I answer the phone and she’s yelling at me because apparently the map showed that I wasn’t where I told her I was (so she was spying on my location..). We argued and she made up some dumb excuse for why she embarrassed me.. saying the weather was bad and that she was concerned, but that it was my fault because I left when I knew the weather would be bad. I’m 19 now. She has access to all my emails (except one that I use for reddit) and social media. I now have social anxiety to the point where my mom has to do everything for me. Anytime our opinions don’t match or I give her “tough love” she tells me she feels betrayed by me. When I order food at restaurants I either let her order for me or I look to her for approval to go ahead and order. It is not even on purpose, it is just habit. When I’m at the doctors office I will explain my issues the best that I can, but she always has to add something because my explanation wasn’t good enough. When I get bad grades, I have a panic attack. I ask myself “what will mom do when she finds out?” I’ve never had a job because I’m too scared to work. My mom is obsessed with my weight. I am 130 pounds and 5 foot exactly. I’m a little on the thicker side but I’m not fat. There have been times when shes grabbed the fat on my arms, my least favorite body part, and said I don’t want my arms to look like “chicken legs” or something like that. I actually don’t normally hate my body, but every time she points something out I start noticing and hating it. Recently I went on antidepressants for my social anxiety. It’s only been about a week on them so I don’t expect much difference and there hasnt been yet. I know SSRI’s can take a while to work. I have eaten pretty normally, but my mom is obsessed with weight gain. I know they can make you gain weight, but its like thats all she talks about. These meds make you really tired so i havent been motivated, but she is forcing me to walk in the heat with her. Ive been telling her how tired they make me, but its like she doesnt understand. So I walked with her and afterwards felt so nauseous that i thought i was going to throw up (and i already have once). I don’t have anymore friends. I haven’t drove my car once this entire summer, and I hardly leave the house. Somedays I feel like a miserable excuse for a person, and this has made me think suicidal thoughts. The other day my mom actually told me that I don’t have depression because its not as bad as someone else she knows. No, maybe I don’t have “depression” but that doesn’t mean I don’t contemplate death. Before I started this medication I thought about death every single day and never told anyone. I love my mom, but this is the result of helicopter parenting. Now, I can’t even order food for myself or call the doctors office to set up an appointment. I would never want my child to go through what I now go through on a day to day basis. I feel like I’ve regressed back to infancy, always looking to my mom for approval. Raising my hand in class is an improvement for me. And that is just sad. At the same time my mom is nagging me to join clubs and make friends and I’m still trying to figure out how to raise my damn hand in class without having a panic attack. But no improvement is ever good enough. If I told her I raised my hand in class for the first time in 6 months she’d tell me that I need to force myself to join a club instead. Then I’m called too sensitive because I regress back into my shell after her statement. And apparently, we don’t believe in congratulating someone for little things like raising their hand because thats nothing. I am going to have to see my school counselor once the semester starts. I cannot keep living like this. This isn’t a reality to me. There is no way this is what my life has become. I have so much to say, and so many dreams of my own. I want to be successful. I don’t want to be figuring out how to be normal functioning human when I’m only months away from being 20.. I’m sorry if this whole thing sounds very melodramatic. I guess it is going to be dramatic for me... i’ve been dealing with it for at least 7 years now. 7 years of social anxiety that has gotten worse and worse over time.

I’m scared my dates will judge me for having relatively little sexual experience. (I’ve only had sex a few times) I’m also scared they will judge me for my living situation (more on that below). * I live with my parents still, since my line of work is hard to break into (Writing). I did secure an internship from home recently, which has the potential to move into full time work. I’m terrified that a potential partner will judge me for this. * I’ve come to the realization this last year that I’m fairly happy with only a close friend or two, yet I believe even an introvert should get out of the house semi-regularly.

It was obvious she was very interested in me, and I got interested in her too. I added her on Facebook after that school trip and she messaged me the next day, saying that she had seen me leaving school but I was already too far away. We chatted for a slight bit and then she said her class had ended she was leaving school. I just said \"ok, talk to you later\" or something along the lines. In reality she wanted me to tell her to meet up, considering that I was free, at home and so was she, free, leaving school. That was the end of our conversation, period. Over the next few weeks/months I kept seeing her at school seeing as we had similar schedules. We\\'d say hi and she\\'d always chat me up. At first we\\'d talk for 5-10 or more minutes. That faded to just saying hi, to not even acknowledging (or rather avoiding) her most times, even though the only thing I thought about while at school was seeing her. That went on for an entire year. The next school year started and for some reason I told my about all this and he, obviously, said how much of a dumbass I for not making a move. So I decided I had to confront her, which just so coincided with her birthday. I messaged her at night on Facebook, saying happy birthday. She responded early in the morning, said thank you and that she was heading up to the university. I, as well, had a class so I said I\\'d see her there. I saw her there and we talked for what seemed like an hour. At the end of it, I just confronted her about what had happened, asked her if she was expecting me to make a move (which I obviously knew the answer to, and it was yes), she said yes. Asked her if she\\'d be down to try to get things going now and she agreed. She had another class and I didn\\'t so I left for home and messaged her as soon as I got there. We talked for the entire day, until she went to her birthday party where she wouldn\\'t have access to a phone or internet. We kept talking non-stop every day, and not in a friend kind of way. It was obvious we were getting together. We met up. Texted. Talked. Met up again. Dated for like 3 weeks or a month and while I was very nervous at times, it was the best weeks of my life. I still remember her touch. Her kissing my cheek, my neck. After that she suddenly texts me saying she feels the relationship is heading towards a friendship rather than a girlfriend/boyfriend type of a situation, and that was due to me not showing enough affection, love. An *entire year* of being obsessed with her, finally mustering up the courage to confront her, us getting together only for it to fall apart so quickly absolutely *devastated* me. I was dead. Dead. We agreed on being friends, and we kept in touch. Talked on Facebook and met up from time to time. While I obviously still had feelings for her, and she was aware of it, it wasn\\'t too bad. Yes I was sulking at times, but I was getting by. There were times where I didn\\'t really even think of her that much. - And then this Friday...We decided to meet up because she messaged me saying she missed me a ton (I had seen her over coffee two weeks prior). We met up near our school, walked around for about an hour, then went to a bar where a friend of mine works and drank, but not a lot. Just got tipsy. We probably spent 3-4 hours there, talking non-stop. Then I took her home (which is pretty far away from mine). We sat outside her house at 1am talking and talking. It felt exactly like the times when we were together. And that, I think, was the final nail the coffin. Experiencing a situation so similar to the ones when we were dating brought it *all* back.

I can\\'t get back with her, but I can\\'t get her out of my head either. *All* I think about is her. The very first thought, every single day I wake up is her name. I don\\'t see cutting her off as an option either because of two reasons. One, I *do* want to just be friends with her if being a couple is not an option because I get along with her more than anyone else I\\'ve met in my life. And more importantly, two, not being in contact with her doesn\\'t seem to make me lose affection for her. I had almost zero contact with for an entire year and I was still madly in love.

I went to the gaeltacht (irish speaking summer camp, 3 weeks only speaking irish away from home), when I was 13-15, and it was an amazing experience. I made new friends from all over the country, fell in love with the language, laughed so much every day. We stayed in houses and in each house was 1-2 leaders which were super bubbly talkative people who had to bring us out of our shell, break the ice in the early days, make sure we didn\\'t speak english, and they also ran daily activities. I knew I was shy but I wanted to be a leader and I thought if I didn\\'t know anyone then I\\'d be able to be that talkative and bubbly. When I was 16, I went as a leader. Everyone was SO SO extroverted, and because we were being \"evaluated\" by our superiors, being watched to see how well we mixed and interacted with other people, I got stage fright and didn\\'t talk to anyone. It was horrible, I felt so ashamed of myself for thinking I could do this and for being the only one who was shy. They must have been thinking \"what the hell is she doing here\". Long story short, none of the other leaders liked me. Like, they hated me. They\\'d talk to me and I\\'d be super quiet and they\\'d do the \"okaaaaay\" and their eyes would dart around and smile at someone when they talked to me. They also gave me grief one day because this boy asked me out, they were making fun of me, which hurt because the girl who was laughing at me was once my leader when I was a student, and I used to be the type of kid who would idolise and have faith in people. This experience broke that. We have one day where parents visit and most people go to a neighbouring town for lunch with them, I saw the other leaders and said \"Hi!!\" and they blanked me. To give context, this wasn\\'t a \"job\", leaders tend to form a close knit group, and I was outside of this. We had a day out to the cinema and there was no room on the bus so I had to go in a teachers car. The teacher shouted into the bus \"who wants to come with me and aoiphes in the car?\", no one moved. Anyway, I don\\'t know why exactly but my faith in others and more importantly myself broke, and is still broken. I actually blocked the experience out, I used to think about it at night and literally sweat and cry and push it out of my mind - it was humiliation, 3 straight weeks of it. I\\'m leaving specific bits out because they\\'re hard to describe but a lot of my flashbacks were of peoples expressions of suppressed laughter anytime I spoke to them. Or another leader rolling her eyes at me for not being good enough. It was like, you know when you do something silly by accident in front of people, and you think about it for years but the amount you think of it decreases with time? Well it\\'s like that, only happening continuously for 3 weeks. I honestly think I got PTSD from that experience. It took me years to allow myself to think about it, and it was painful. My description probably doesn\\'t make it sound that bad, but it was just things happening over and over again that confirmed for me that I was a failure and everyone hates me. Learning negative things about yourself one after the other with no time to process. It\\'s been better lately. Sometimes I think about it without cringing.

Hey guys, I've been anxious and depressed enough that I can't take it anymore, when I was the age of 0-14 I was a funny, very social, empathious fun kid. I always had friends, always was a part of everything and everyone recognized me for my laughing. Untill I hit my puberty ( not the reason why I'm anxious I think ) since that time I got even scared to open the door, I still don't have a job ( I'm 16 now ) and I'm currently in wait for my new school which I'm 2 months later then everyone else. Just because I canceled my other school since I was too anxious of finding a internship work place. I still only have old friends from the time when I was 'myself' and no new ones. I've always been very hyper since I was a kid and then my parents decided to diagnose me and turned out I had ADHD. It dind't bother me at that time. I do speak to my parents but not very much. Especially not about my feelings which I don't do with barely anyone. I dissapoint them alot with my anxious feelings for example the one from when I needed to find the internship work place. My mom keeps saying that I'm anxious because I have been judged by everyone my whole life and I know she is right but its not only that, I have also been taking Ritalin for a few years and from that moment everything changed, one day when I felt very anxious after 30 minutes of taking my Ritalin. I was in school at lunch break just with a bunch of friends because I wasn't having those anxious issues then, but I felt very depressed and anxious then and I also later called my mom asked if I could go home because I was feeling sick. I dind't mention that I was anxious to her. Next day I woke up and again took my dose of Ritalin ( I'm not gonna call it medication ) I felt exactly the same as the day before so I called my mom again and asked if I could go home. I still dind't tell about the anxious and negative thought I had. From that moment I wasn't feeling myself untill this day. I am feeling so tired, nothing makes me happy and I just feel so fucking miserable and anxious about even doing the smallest things. The worst thing is that I KNOW I can be myself because I have been in the past, but I don't know how or what to do. I'm also using little doses of sativa or hybrid strains of weed ( I vaporize them ) and it does really help for my ADHD to calm down my brains but it still doesn't make me feel myself happy from how I used to be. Obviously I still have some days where I feel happy but those only happen like once in a month . I also once was out for dinner with the whole fam and I was feeling very drowsy and just not active but I brought my filled vaporizer ( dry herb vaporizer ) with weed. So I vaped outside and I was myself again, I was talking to my fam and it was like I was reborn again. When I got home I was so happy and mostly proud, I later said to my mom what I did when I went outside and she already knew I smoke and shes okay with it as long as I don't get addicted and she also was a bit happy because she really saw the diffrence, its not always when weed works like that. But when I'm with friends and I smoke I always feel very comfortable around them and have a good time. They mostly make me forget to look at my phone so thats a good sign. I really want to feel like how I used to because most people liked me then alot. I also stopped growing from when I was using the Ritalin and last year I have grown so much from the moment when I stopped using it. I feel like ritalin fucked up my serotonin receptors because I know alot about all drugs. I know that Ritalin is in the same family as speed which makes it possible that it fucked up my serotonin receptors. Anyhow I've also tried LSD a couple of times and it made me social anxious as fuck, really dind't wanna see anyone when I did that. But I know that that isn't how I am because I used to be so social but how come I'm not anymore? If anyone has tips or questions. Please feel free to ask / tell them!! I use L-theanine now for a while and it makes me alot more relaxed in my head, but they don't bring back the old me. I don't use chemical pills ever again because they're dangerous and addictive. Not only because they're toxic itself but also because they might have fucked up my whole personality. Its insane that when I think of it now they just give speed to 8 year olds because they have a disorder which makes them hyper in their head. Its not right, thats the reason why I only use natural products to relax my brain, L-Theanine, weed and omega-3. I also have used XTC like 3 times and when I do xtc I can talk to people again with no problem and it just goes extremely easy then. But I don't use it more then twice a year.

Now it\\'s even worse though because it happens at work, and I work on movie sets, and on movie sets they usually record sound because it\\'s post-1920, which means everyone on set needs to be DEAD silent. Sometimes there are emotional scenes with long, silent pauses in between actors\\' lines. Sometimes there\\'s just quiet while they\\'re waiting for an airplane to go by. And at the end of every day or when they finish shooting in a particular space, they record \"room tone\" which is just 30 seconds of complete, 100% silence. And usually these spaces are very small and filled with lots of people like the director, the script supervisor, the 1st AD, the DP, the 1st AC, the 2nd AC, the boom operator and/or sound mixer, 1+ talent, possibly other department heads like the gaffer, key grip, production designer, or makeup, possibly multiple PAs there to make sure everybody is quiet, etc. and if you make noise you\\'ve fucked up the take. I have such severe anxiety about stomach noises on set that I basically try to avoid actually being on set as much as possible. I\\'m constantly terrified of getting stuck inside when they\\'re about to shoot, because as an electrician I might need to be nearby for small, last second lighting adjustments, or even worse, to do a light gag (lights go on/off or flicker/dim during the shot). I avoid it at all costs and try to stay in an area with no people or somewhere outside where it\\'s loud.

            "{'sequence': \"('Social Anxiety from eating in public. Advice on self-help tips for overcoming this?. Sorry in advance for the long story that i’m about to post but I hope you guys give it a read. I’ve been getting social anxiety especially from eating in public for 2-3 years now and the fact that I can’t even have a peaceful/enjoyable meal out with my friends have been eating me inside out and I want to overcome this so so so badly. The past few years has honestly been the worst few years of my life and I so desperately want things to change. The eating anxiety I have doesn’t really come from being afraid of being looked at in public, its more of being afraid that I would gag/throw up when eating because of the intense nauseous feelings I get whenever I am eating outside in public and it simply just kills my appetite. Its like a vicious cycle. This is how it all started. 3 years ago, I was still all fine with very minimal social anxiety. Since young I have always been a shy and quiet person if you don’t get to know me well but among my friends i’d like to think that I am quite talkative and fun. I hung out with friends very easily in school and used to enjoy going out with them. I even had many friends from the “popular” group in school if that’s what you call them. However sadly this changed for the worse in 2017. I was finishing school and was about to enter mandatory military service. I suddenly got so much anxiety ever since I was about to enter military as there was so much uncertainties that I had about it. I was afraid that I would have a tough time, afraid that I would not be able to adapt to a very different environment, afraid of missing home too much etc. To put it shortly, there were so many things that were not under my control that gave me so much anxiety during this period. I was still at school when all these anxiety came about, and it seemed to just keep getting worse during that time. Sometimes in the morning before going to school i’d feel nauseous for no reason, even brushing my teeth in the morning would cause me to gag. Sometimes (even though rarely) I would even have to go to the toilet just because I felt like throwing up from the nausea I was getting. I started losing appetite very easily and started to rarely have a proper meal during lunch time in school. I started avoiding going out with my friends because of all this feelings I was getting stemming from the anxiety I got. Fast forward to now, I have completed my service and about to start uni early next year. I would say that my anxiety has gotten much better compared to where I was a few years back. However I was never the same in terms of eating in public ever since. I still get all nauseous/choked up/no appetite whenever I am eating outside. When I eat at home its the complete opposite, I can properly enjoy a good meal with no issues at all when i’m home, because I feel “safe”, that even if I throw up/gag nobody can notice or judge. And because of this sense of safety, ironically I don’t have any anxiety at all and don’t feel any nausea, However when i’m out I can only eat in small bites and I find it so difficult to even finish a normal meal. Its taken such a massive toll on my social life. In the past I would hang out with my friends every week, and also go outside to play sports every week. Now these things rarely ever happen anymore, not because I wasn’t invited but because I had to reject my friends every time they asked me out because I didn’t want to end up embarassing myself when we have a meal. Honestly this really hurt me so much because my friends probably now thinks I am deliberately avoiding them or that I don’t wanna hang out with them anymore but the truth is I really don’t have a choice because of all the anxiety I have had experienced. Sometimes I just wished that everyone can understand how I feel or what I am going through. I am starting school again in a few months and I really want to just change myself, and go back to my old self where I had no anxiety when eating in public, where I could really feel joy and happiness when going out with my family and friends, where I don’t have to keep worrying about my eating anxiety, and where I can just feel genuinely happy again. Please advice me on tips I can use as self-help to overcome my social eating anxiety, and thank you for taking the time off your day to read my story. ☺️')\", 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with negative effect', 'outdoor activity or space with positive effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect'], 'scores': [0.47310206294059753, 0.27274417877197266, 0.2541537582874298]}\n",

I experienced most/all of the things you mention. I wouldn’t go anywhere for weeks for fear of people seeing me. I was terrified if I went outside to get the mail that a neighbor would see me and judge me. I’d only go grocery shopping at bizarre hours and only use the self check out because of fear of what the cashier would think of me and my purchases. Going to any social event caused panic attacks (sweating, trembling, trouble breathing, chest pain, dizziness). I lived a solitary life and would go months without social interaction. Going so long without having so much as a conversation made me really awkward in any social interaction that I did have. I would be really quiet and keep to myself. Afterwards I’d over-analyze everything that happened, even for days or weeks. So how did I climb out…? Very slowly. I have been on and off antidepressants (SSRIs) since I was 15, never on for longer than 3 months, then I would hop back on when I started to feel really down. I think they helped with the depression, but not so much the social anxiety. I have been on and off therapy as well…and couldn’t really commit to that either. It’s hard to go tell someone your most intimate feelings and thoughts when you’re afraid of how they’re judging you. However, I think it does help some people. I was recommended this [book](It might help. I made one friend towards the end of high school. I had no idea why he wanted to be my friend, but I was so desperate for a friend I just went with it. I found it much easier to just hang with 1 person than a large group that I didn’t know. Then I made one really good friend in my first year of college. She much more actively took action to become my friend, than me becoming hers. We became basically inseparable, and she was my only friend for a while but that was okay because all my social needs were met through her. I transferred schools and she got a boyfriend and our very codependent relationship kinda fell apart. I felt lost for a while, but that is when I realized that I shouldn’t be that dependent on someone else. I made a friend at my new school. I moved on campus and started interacting more with my roommates. I became involved with clubs. I started by just attending talks and meetings, then eventually went onto becoming an officer. A lot of classes were team projects, so I befriended some teammates. I took a teaching assistant position and met people that way. As my circle of friends grew, I met more friends through them. I threw some parties. I went to parties. I learned that sometimes you have to be assertive when making friends. I faked confidence and asked people to hang out, chatted them up online, said hi and talked to them when I saw them. Eventually, it starts to feel less forced and more natural. By the time I graduated I had a great group of friends ranging from very close to not so close. It wasn’t smooth sailing always. I had a really hard time during my internship. I didn’t fit in with the other interns at all. It was like they just looked at me and labeled me as a loser. I felt very socially awkward since most of my friends were also very nerdy/geeky and the interns were a different breed. I did try, but I failed and it was a hard summer for me. I spent most my weekends alone while the others were out doing what interns should do when spending the summer in a beautiful new city. About 6 months ago I moved to a new city, and it’s been tough making friends and adjusting. I feel the insecurities and low self-esteem creeping in on me. I hated constantly meeting new people and small talk. I’m so paranoid that people will see through my confident veneer and find me to be just a giant loser. I miss the easiness with my friends. I tried organizing events with some people at work, but those fell through. Sucks being in a new city with so much to do, but no one to do with it. In the back of my mind, I still fear that if I go do things alone people will see me think of me as a friendless loser. As you can see it’s still a struggle sometimes, but I know I’ve come a long way. I don’t think I’ll ever be the life of the party or 100% not socially awkward. I still have fears and insecurities, but I think the best way to get over them is to just face them. Sometimes you’ll fail real hard, but you’ll learn and get better. I know it’ll be a while before I build a social network like the one I had in college. I’m gonna try taking a fun class after work, meetup.com, and finding a place to volunteer. I’m planning on facing my fear of doing things alone…and I’m gonna go out there and do things alone and hopefully make friends along the way.

No. Your present does not determine your future, as you have the power to make the decisions to change your future into a more desirable one. I understand this can sound harsh, but OP, I needed it when I felt the same way as you, so hear me out. By the way, the size of your dick doesn't matter as some girls can't comfortably take a lot anyway. Sex is not a requisite for social status. Don't let society fool you. A relationship will not be healthy in the long term if you are emotionally vulnerable. Take the time to grow and take care of yourself first, worry for yourself before other things. Please stop smoking and drinking alcohol. Find an alternative, even vaping or whatever. When you try a certain way and it doesn't work, try another way. Alcohol is a depressant. Smoking shits on your health. Don't consume them. Take up classes. Dance, martial arts, parkour, cooking, anything. Help the community out, volunteer. The Meetup app has clubs you can join to meet people of similar interests. The best way to rid yourself of social anxiety is through exposure. You can learn social skills. You have so much potential, OP. You just have to keep your head up despite the challenges (it will not be easy), and don't let yourself stop you from progressing. Our biggest demons are not the adversities around us, but ourselves. Keep a realistic mindset and you can get to what you want. Be wary of absolute thinking patterns. You can do it. Whenever you get depressive, be your own cheerleader and remind yourself of what you can achieve. You are never weak due to mental illness. Having mental illness is hardcore, and you are so strong for wrangling it. If you need further support, hit me up. I'll be happy to help you in any way I can.

            "{'sequence': '(\\' In my school we always talked about how there was obvious bullying and \"inside-bullying\". I\\'ve been a big victim of the inside-bullying too. Nobody respected me and they obviously talked behind my back because they thought I was annoying or weird or unlikeable and like you\\'ve experienced, they also made these strange proclamations of my name in class too and I think the straw that broke the camels back was when I started to realize that when we had to do the \"find someone to be in group with\" stuff people would walk away as soon as I walked over to them even if I had occasionally talked with them before. It\\'s a testament to how bad my social skills were and how asocial i was outside of classes but what could I do? I couldn\\'t figure it out and people started to think me annoying for it which led to internal bullying. In middle school I had more of it. People would always put me down for whatever I did that wasn\\'t academically succesful which was at least nice so I had something I was okay at, at the time. If I started running people would point and laugh because \"you\\'re a nerd and you can\\'t be sporty\". If I said something I thought was funny then people would default to arrogance and assume what I was about to say would be stupid and then look at each other laughing at what I said as if they were embarrassed I was trying to make eye contact with them because I wasn\\'t worth talking to. I would go as far as to say I have a kind of built up hatred towards people in general over my early schooldays. I know my problems stem from my own lack of putting myself into respect, but sometimes one thing leads to another for no particualr reason and you\\'re put in an unfortunate position for the rest of your time in a group and that can scar you for life if you can\\'t move on from it easily. I don\\'t think often about it admittedly, but if I have to think back in my life all my problems started early on like that. I don\\'t trust people and I assume what I do will be unworthy or stupid or cringeworthy before I even try and i don\\'t take risks because I\\'m afraid people will laugh or ridicule me. It\\'s not irrational. That whole \"anxiety is irrational\" crap is bullshit if you have tried being bullied. It\\'s real and there is a consequence that genuinely hurts if you fail and you\\'ve tried it before, and my worst thoughts tell me that I hate a lot of people for not understanding because they\\'re had it incredibly easy. They\\'ve never fallen out in a group and they\\'ve never done something bad which they couldn\\'t then defend or make up for afterwards. They\\'ve not been stuck in a hole without the skills to crawl up again. They can make it seem like anxiety is strange as much as they like and I\\'ll hate them for it just for their lack of understanding. Anyone who\\'s been a victim of anything will have a newfound dislike for a group untouched by those kinds of circumstances. They don\\'t know anything nor could they care about it unless they try it. That\\'s probably the darkest corners of my mind; the thoughts that say to me that I really want \"good\" people to have it bad. I want people to be bullied like I was. It\\'s like a revenge fantasy that I can\\'t put a lid on. I won\\'t like people who have it good.

Like on Pc, AppStore, or Console games. Also, what games do you play? For the gym I can tell you since I\\'ve been doing a lot of research about health, nutrition, and bodybuilding. It all depends on what your goal is like to be just Fit lose couple pounds, To Lose a Ton of weight, or to Gain Muscle. Remember those huge bodybuilders had to start somewhere. What body builders usually do or skinny people is bulk up- eat a ton more then they workout out gain more muscle and strength and then cut- do more cardio eat less to get the sixpack/defined muscles. But you can also do cardio to fill out before you start lifting. If I would have to give couple tips for working out it would be Consistency Diet Not worrying about results You can workout your hardest but if you still eat like shit you will not get results. Now since I told you you shouldn\\'t eat like shit you might ask the question what should I eat? or maybe I can\\'t afford organic or good foods or something along the line. I\\'m going to be a 100 diets will not work for you and when I mean \"Diet\" I mean just going on a diet for couple weeks and then stopping and going back to what you usually eat. You have to make a lifestyle change. That means quitting foods that are making you gain weight and replacing foods that make you not gain weight. I\\'ll tell you straight up what worked for me. Ok here\\'s what I do I would waking up early and then run a mile everyday with empty stomach w/ only water. Then for lunch everyday I ate a salad (Which I hate) and water. Lastly when I got home I ran another mile and for dinner I ate either Starches, Fruits, and Veggies. Sleep is also essential because that\\'s where you lose weight/gain muscle. That would be my \"Diet\" plan to lose weight fast but if you ever want long term results your going to have change your lifestyle/eating habits and either eliminate, reduce, or replace them. I can also give a list of amazing foods and a book that I would 100% recommend for people trying to lose weight. That sounds amazing that you got on a date!

            "{'sequence': '(\\'I froze twise while approching a on Ecstasy.. (Long Post) (Need help) This happened yesterday, their was a fest going on in our University and since it was my last fest, i decided to drop Ecstasy. Since our University is located in a rural area their are no proper bars or pubs to drink, so the students have started drinking in a garden which is 50 metres from our University. This was a three day fest and on day two i went out drinking in this garden. I was drinking with my buddies (all guys) and after some time a group of girls from our University came and started drinking besides us. While drinking i noticed that two girls from that group are checking me out. Something about myself:- I am a 21 year old law student in the last year of his course. I have major social anxiety and in my five years at Uni, i have only socialized with a small group of people in my four years in Uni and almost all of them were guys. This was primarily because i got a cultural shock when i moved from a small town to one of the elitist University in India. I am 6ft 2inch with good facial features but a skinny frame. Generally people rate me 7/10. I was decently confident when i started University, but due to my inability to speak fluent English (which is the primary language of conversation in this place) and the highly urban crowd which i had never experienced before, my self confidence was very badly damaged. On top of that i made friends with people who had the same problem of language and culture like me, people who didn\\'t exactly \\'fit\\' in this place. Irrespective, they were pretty toxic and always discouraged and scrutinized any attempts that I made to socialize with people out of our social circle. They would make fun of me for misspranousning words in my presentation and not able to form a coherent sentence when participating in class or speaking to other students. This led to me becoming more and more anxious leading to a total stop by me to try anything or interacting with new people. I just started keeping quiet in lectures and just didn\\'t interact with anyone in the class and made my body language very unnapprochable. This led me getting isolated, loosing my self worth and growing more and more insecure about myself everyday. I started suppressing my opinions and started doing everything which was acceptable by my isolated group of friends. I turned to weed and used to numb myself with it to coupe with the anxiety but the paranoia kept making it worse. I finally started fighting back from my third year and started working on myself. I started getting better at speaking English, learned a lot of new things, got better at studies and putting my opinion forward. I started being more assertive about my boundaries and stopped my friends from walking all over me all the time. But still there is a lot of anxiety, insecurity and an overall inferiority complex. I have only dated one girl in my life which was long distance, we met twice in 3 months and just made out. I don\\'t consider this a proper relationship though. I have a decent amount of good female friends. But it is very difficult for me to talk to a unknown girl, and usually make a fool of myself. I get a decent amount of female attention and a lot of girls have tried to flirt with me but i just get too anxious and awkward. I start overthinking the interaction and always find a way to convince myself that this one isn\\'t right for maybe the next one. However, now i have changed myself and i am trying to actively communicate with girls. I even approached two girls in the gap of six months and got rejected both the times due to very awkward conversation both the times. I have been feeling very lonely for the past 3 years and i crave romantic intimacy. Coming back to story:- After realising that both of them have been glancing towards me, i started making eye contact with the one I was interested in. However, like always i didn\\'t approach her and just left the place after finishing the booze and even give a look back. The next day( last day of the fest) i popped ecstasy and went to the garden with my friends, i started tripping intensely after i reached the party garden. Coincidentally, the same group of girls from day two came and started drinking 20 meters away from us. At this time i had reached my \\'peak\\' of ecstasy and was tripping major nutsack. The high started reducing and got a collected my self a little bit but i was still pretty high, now i start noticing that the same girl from yesterday was again galncing at me in very short intervals, i started making eye contact with her but would break it in 2-3 seconds because of second thoughts. My friends started leaving for college but i was still pretty high so i decided to stay on my own, i started socialzing with people that i knew and all this while me and that girl kept making eye contact. I still wasn\\'t sure weather i should go and talk to her. Then she looked at me for like 10 seconds without breaking eye contact and gave a huge smile. Because of the lowself esteem idiot that i am, i looked turned my neck in both the directions to confirm that she was actually smiling at me. Any other day I would have bounced from that place without approaching her because of my fear of rejection and making a fool out myself but not this time. This time i was on Ecstasy and wasn\\'t feeling my high level of anxiety which generally happens in these kind of situation. I decided I am going to make to make a move this time. I had promised myself in the summer that I\\'ll try and break my virginity in my last year of law school. I waited for an appropriate moment in which she wasn\\'t occupied too much by her friends. I saw an opening and started walking towards her, she was making her drink from the bottle which was on the ground. I stopped 3 ft away from she turned saw me and smiled like she was expecting me. She turned her head again and i just froze. I couldn\\'t utter a word, and after standing there for like 5 seconds without saying anything. I just walked of from their. I cursed by my self for being so pathetic and thought about going back in the college. But i decided to calm myself and try once again because i was really interested in this girl. I smoke a cigarette, muster all the courage and started walking towards her again, this time she was standing with her friend who were both dancing on rap. I stopped she saw me then started looking at her friend. I am feeling extremely nervous right now but i fight it and after 3 seconds i say \" I am sorry for earlier, i just got nervous\" in a very shaky voice. She responded \"it\\'s okay you don\\'t have to worry about that\" in a very soft tone. I ask her name tell her mine then shook her hand. Another friend of her came thinking that i was making her friend uncomfortable. Her friend who came, starts looking at me in a very suspicious way because it could be interpreted by my face that i was on some hard Drugs ( which i think the girl who i approached also figured out) my anxiety shoot up the roof and i wasn\\'t able to utter even an alphabet. I froze again and walked of again, this time for real. I had a very bad trip after this incident and kept cursing myself for being a losser. I seriously need help as to how to overcome my social anxiety and be self- confident, that why i gave a detailed description of myself. I also got to know that the girl i approached is a mutual friend of a guy freind of mine and he has recommended me to send a insta request and start chatting with her.

I get wasted on days I feel like people dislike me (like when coworkers don\\'t sit down next to me at work, or ignore me when I ask a question). And after trying to unsuccessfully socialise at work for a week, I fell back into my cold/distant self and do awkward stuff like walking 10 meters behind my coworkers on my way to work, instead of running up to them, because I don\\'t want to annoy them or get the feeling they\\'re annoyed by me.

That summer I worked at a fast food restaurant, whenever I was on the register I would talk to the customers, that was excellent practice, if I didn't feel like talking I could just stick to the script (would you like fries with that) if I did feel like talking I'd chat for a bit while taking there order. I noticed that customers liked talking to me and that helped my confidence in talking. When school started back up I finally started talking to whoever I sat next to, not because I had to, but because I wanted to.

Hi, I've noticed I haven't left the house much in the last couple of days apart from to get food, so spend like an hour out the house and then come back. I'm working on Fiverr atm and making quite a lot of money from it, much more then a 9/5 job would give me. And its freelance so I can set my hours etc. I guess my question is a two part thing. The first thing is that i'm aware that my job working from home in my music studio is quite isolating, but also if im more comfortable working this way and am making way more then a 9/5 anyway do I really need a 9/5? I still go out and socialise and see my mates on the weekend at least, but most of my days im alone working and then go out for nights out if im invited. My days atm basically is mostly making music for people all day and then I try and get out for a run or go to the shops for an hour or so in between. But sometimes if my mates don't have work they will invite me to stuff and ill go. Second part of the question is does anyone else do this? like find themselves staying at home a lot. Like say if there's a day where I don't have work to do id still choose to stay at home and chill instead of go and walk around the city aimlessly. Like if I don't have a plan ill just spend my day at home. I don't even view it as an anxiety thing really, im just not great at doing stuff on my own and if I do like I don't really see the point in just aimlessly walking around the city with nothing to do because.... there's nothing to do ahahah.  and#x200B; What do you guys do when your alone and don't have work that day? do u guys stay at home all day and chill also. is this ok to do? assuming you've got work on other days like I do.

            "{'sequence': \"('How social anxiety ruined my life. Hi there reddit, since i am not a native English speaker i'll be using Google Translaitor. I am not seeking for help or life advice i just want to talk. I am 20 and half years old and only now i realised how completely i ruined my life because of the anxiety. And there is no way out for me. As far as I remember myself, I was always a rather shy and closed child, I did not go out outside unnecessarily. My first friends (and the only ones) appeared in my 5th grade. I well remember how we met, it was some kind of event and a couple of guys from my class came up to me and we just started chatting about everything - games, films, football, we chatted for at least two hours and then headed home and exchanged each other with console games. And in my opinion, it was a lot easier to communicate with strangers then. Secondary school, and then in my opinion the first problems appeared. When the homework was a pubic presentation or recitation of a verse by heart, I never completed these homewroks, as a result of which I got F grade and I had to hope only that in future we would no longer have such tasks, I was also afraid to go to the teacher and give me an individual task. In high school, the situation did not change, I was still afraid of public speaking and did not leave home unnecessarily, and when friends called for a walk, I always said that I was busy. A quick fact, in all my life I have never been to a cafe, to the cinema i wasnt even in a store alone. If I needed something, I asked my parents or sister to buy me. In 2016, I passed the exams and entered the pedagogical university at the Faculty of Philology, this was one of the biggest mistakes in my life. Due to the fact that I did not really care about where to go, I had to quickly choose the direction. I had to move from countryside to city (not to far tho, about 130 kms) and learn to live on my own, buy groceries, pay utility bills and most importantly communicate with people, from that moment I no longer saw my friends live, both moved to other cities. Speaking of classes at the university, each English class needed to stand in front of the audience and tell the learned text, there were also quite often group work, and if I could barely cope with the first example, then when we worked in groups I was ready to disappear, run away , do anything if only I were not here, cause i simply cant talk to people which i dont know, My palms and forehead began to sweat. No kidding, when I reached the bus stop and went to the university, for me it was a real challenge. What makes me even more anxious is that there were 22 girls and 6 boys in the group keying me. I went through anxiety for two months until one day I decided not to go to university, and from that moment on, my life went awry. I began to skip classes more and more, sleep problems started, I went to bed at 8 in the morning, and got up at 7 in the evening and my parents didnt even know about this situation. With bad points, but I still went through the first semester. But in the second situation did not change, I was not at the university for exactly a month and none of my classmates, headmen or curator were interested in what happened to me. By the way, in January 2017, I stopped talking with one of my friends, the communication just broke due to some little trifle I don’t even want to mention it. April 2017, the curator told his parents that I did not attend classes, but I in turn made promises that I would attend classes. One day, after a long absence in class, the curator called me to his place and began to ask me what was happening to me, I had good points for the first months of my studies, and then everything went awry. After the conversation, she advised me to turn to a psychologist, but I immediately rejected this idea, although now, I understand that it might be worth giving this idea a chance. Even the girls from the group offered me their help, but I refused, i decided that it will be extremley hard to comeback.I just don’t have the courage to approach the teacher and ask for additional classes. As a result i was expelled from university. While I was in the city alone, I talked a lot about what to do next. They set me up as an example for my sister, laid more hopes on me, but I just didn’t live up to these hopes, I myself was not in awe of myself, I considered myself miserable and that there was no place for me like this in this world, so I decided that the best option there will be suicide. I decided to hang myself in the closet and when I felt cramps and lack of oxygen, a stupid thought crept into my head and said to me “Do not do this, give yourself a chance”. Now, I really regret that I succumbed to that thought and did not finish what it would be worth In September 2017, I entered college and again, in November 2017, I was expelled. Classical history, anxiety, unwillingness to leave the dorm room due to loneliness, although I understand that I had to go to college and university not for communication, but for education. For almost 2 years now I have been living with my parents in the village, I leave the house only to throw snow from the yard, I haven’t been talking with my last friend since January 2019. My younger sister graduated from college, works and receives money, while I just sit on the neck of the parents. Guess, i messed up my life, opportunities, goal and there is nothing i can do about it. I dont watch movies, series, anime, sometimes playing games but right now nothing interests me, i just lay down on the bed and thinking about my pasy and what i have done.

When I was 20 my besfriend broke up with her long term bf and started geting closer to me and then confessed that she loved me and I already had a tiny crush on her so we decided to try it out ( didnt last long ) we went on 3 diffrent dates. First date we just went to the movies and later ate at a restaurant and walked around after that day she ghosted me for 2 weeks and then started talking to me again and said sorry and wanted to try again. Second date I went hiking with her and watched the sunset and ate at a pizza place after that day she avoided me for a few days with a bunch excuses then asked me out again and I was like sure. Third date we went to a restaurant then walked by the beach and saw the sunset she kissed me that night and told me why she avoided me all those days apperntly she was scared we would destroy our friendship and she already lost her bofriend and didnt wanna lose me too well I accepted her but few days later I went out with a cousin to watch some movies and a saw her walking with her neighboor (she told she was studying at home ) and then they started kissing they looked so inloved. It kinda hurt becuase she was my befriend and lied to me. But I grabbed my phone took a picture of them send it to her and told her with a message \"I just saw you And I dont think we can be friends anymore\" and I ghosted her after that I cut all contact with friends of hers and family (first time I ghosted someone). I like to tell myself its no big deal but it really hurts when someone you trust betrays you like that. This event isnt really the reason for my anxiety but it sure made a bit worse I think. I had a rough childhood parents were really aggrasive and both are introverts and when I was diagonesed with anxiety as a kid my parent decided to try not to fight in front of me anymore ( they didnt do a good job at it ) aslo tey started ignoring me becuase they thought they were toxic for me to be around them. So I grow up with introverted parents that argued violently in front of me and isolated me. Afcouse they werent bad parents they did the best that they good. They fucked me up mentally but I didnt starve, I have a home, education I am doing fine so they did great job and I love them for it.\\')', 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with negative effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect', 'outdoor activity or space with positive effect'], 'scores': [0.8057384490966797, 0.09769977629184723, 0.0965617448091507]}\n",

I was real bad because I couldn’t serve, I couldn’t set, and my wrist/arms hurt every time I hit the god damn ball. Like how tf do girls deal with that. It’s real bad especially if the other team targets you because your the weak one in the team. Some other examples of anxiety in sports that I’ve felt looking back. When your playing football and you run out, you see the quarterback and he looks at you and then ignores you and continues with the play. Or he finally decides to throw it to you and sadly the catch is not received. Especially embarrassing if your wide-open :/ Same with baseball, someone would hit a pop fly out to me and I would usually miss and have to throw it in. The shame, the shameeee. The rest I would just try to make jokes on them I would feel the anxiety but I wasn’t scared of doing the sports. I was scared of failure and of losing. I was real competitive back then. It was like a different anxiety back then. When I got into hs though I didn’t make any sports teams lol and my anxiety was through the roof. Lol that’s pretty funny looking back at it.

Eventually it got to my turn in the game and I asked if I could just pass it to the next person, because I was feeling extremely anxious at this point, but they insisted I just read the card. I tried reading the card but they couldn\\'t really understand me so my boyfriend had to take the card and read it. I felt embarrassed and just sat there feeling really anxious. I felt so out of place in that moment and I just wanted to escape. I snuck away from the table and sat on the couch by myself and started hyperventilating.

Back in my home country, I did not have this debilitating sense of dread whenever I needed to go outside. I have lived in Asia and went to an international school since the second grade. I had a lot of confidence in myself, as well as a decent group of friends. I still wasn't the most social guy, but I had friends I could relate to. I was able to go to malls, shopping centres, cafes and what not, and converse with the cashier/waitress as a normal person would, although I was a bit awkward. Since then, I've moved to the UK for my undergrad, and man I've basically become a shut-in here. I am too shy to make friends with the local students, I feel like my english despite being good enough is different from the way its spoken in Britain, hence whenever I try to start a conversation, my sentences tend to be incomplete and simply words strung together without a proper structure. My self-esteem has suffered deeply because of this. It's been a year and a half now, and its not getting any better. I'm feeling a mixture of denial and knowing that I shouldn't feel this way because I could function normally back home, as well as anger at myself because I just can't help myself to get out of this condition. I refuse to acknowledge that I have a problem, and I keep looking for reasons as to why I might be the way I am now. Here's how my daily life feels like to me: I leave my apartment complex and walk to university. On my way, I feel that everybody is looking at me, judging me for being so awkward and lame. Once I get to the lecture rooms, people are conversing outside, talking to each other while waiting for class to start. I see people I've talked to before, but for some fucking reason I decide not to make eye contact and sit/lounge around alone. I take out my phone, hoping that nobody notices that I am a loner. I walk into the class, and am greeted by the sight and sound of hundreds of students in this massive lecture hall. I try not to make a fuss about it but I am actually panicking about where I would be able to sit down, without attracting attention to myself. I finally find a place and a couple of people in a group decide to sit next to the empty spots next to mine. They're talking, having a lot of fun, asking each other about how last night's party was and what not. And I'm just there, probably they're oblivious to me even being there. Once lecture finishes, and classes are done for the day, I immediately walk back to my room. This walk back is often filled with bitterness and intense feeling of loneliness, as I pass by other students walking with their friends. The worst part of all this is that I can't figure out why I am the way I am now. Why could I function normally, and live without fear back home but once here I'm afraid of the outside world. I'm afraid of the eyes that aren't probably even looking in my direction, of the laughter I hear around me, thinking that it must be at my expense, while simultaneously knowing that it isn't.

I used to be able to go the shop on my own, but now... I don't even go there. I am too scared. Even in broad daylight... I am petrified of going. I don't know who I'll bump into or whatever. I think my anxiety is because I am fearful of what people are capable of. I am a very weary person, and I trust no-one to begin with. I really dislike it when someone says it's just because I'm shy. NO. It's not. You don't quite know how I feel. This is more than being shy. It's fear. I have never been one to make a fuss of anything. I have never been the 'class clown', I have only been in one detention (that was for forgetting a ruler in maths, lol) and I haven't been to the headmasters office. I feel a bit like Elliot from Mr. Robot if anyone knows what that is. I DESPISE going outside in urban areas. I cannot stand densely populated area. My parents often ask me if I want to go on a walk with them and the dog. All too often, I say no. It's not because I'm lazy; rather fearful of who's outside and who might see me. I almost hate everyone at school. Except from a few people. People I associate with. People I know and can trust. Trust has also been a big issue with me. At this moment in time, the only people I trust enough are 2 of my friends and my family. My mum is very supportive.

I stay inside other than when I have to go to school. I hate parties. I hate crowded areas. I cannot speak on the spot if someone questions me about something. I just freeze and stutter... just pushing any old bull**** out of my trap. On a weekend, I spend probably 1/2 of my day in my room. Doing stuff on my computer or just playing games. Enough rambling on. I'll just break down my diagnosis into bullet points for the most relevant things... I cannot make eye contact I hate going outside.

I\\'m 14 and I believe is have had social anxiety for pretty much my entire existence so far. Let\\'s take it back to preschool. I remember looking at myself and always thinking \"I\\'m fat\". I know I was young, but I was extremely skinny, but all I saw was fat when I looked down, and actually tried to keep it a \"secret\" from school and my family.i guess the next instance started around 3rd grade. That was the summer after my great grandma died. She used to live next door, and every day I thought about seeing her. She was an amazing woman that I miss so much. After she passed, I felt at loss for quite a while. The year after, bullying started kicking in. I actually became overweight, really saw no difference than before. I was teased for being fat, or stupid, or told I \"liked boys\". I pretty much felt no need for social interactions any time after that. I know I was young, but of course that shit still happens today to me. As of my current situation, doing almost anything social wise is difficult. The best way I can describe it is like a huge amount of embarrassment before the actual event. But it\\'s really worse than I am describing it. It feels like any action I take in some sort of social area (school, restaurant, store, park, ect.) someone there is either watching me do it and thinking badly of me, which I hate, or I am constantly going over in my had be bad things people will say to me. Confrontations are another big issue for me. If I want something, I would rather miss out than ask for it. It makes me feel like I am burdening someone else\\'s life for my own needs, and that they might think badly of me. This ranges anywhere from asking my brother to help me with homework to even just asking someone to point me in the direction of the soup isle in a store. It is also very difficult for me to do anything social wise that could result in me screwing up, even tho 90% of the things that get to me have a 0% screw up rate.

To start things off: i\\'m 21 years old, i\\'ve been a shut-in since i ended highschool (4 years now...) and i\\'m struggling, really hard, to start something up again. Mostly out of anxiety and fear. God .. okay. So i became a shut-in after some personal issues, including trying to figure out what the hell was going on with my life... having a huge fear of failing things and getting nervous about anything social. I remember my mother telling me that it\\'s just shyness in general but i knew that it was way different, it wasn\\'t shyness, it was actual fear. I\\'m always been a little bit afraid of everything that i\\'m doing. An obvious thing is the pressure of being interesting and not a bore around others. Another one is cooking for others: it feels like they expect me to do at least a good job, but if i mess up i get a hard anxiety attack and start crying. And if i\\'m tasked to do something for someone, like a job task, which i\\'m paid for, i think about it in circles before i even do it, and i imagine what things could go wrong, and how i should do it perfectly, or else i picture people around me laughing or making fun out of me. I was kind of teased that way while growing up... Anyways, things like going outside, making phone calls, interacting with strangers all day makes me feel terrified and sick to my stomach. Work makes me anxious. I\\'m absolutely afraid of starting to work, even though i know i should. I feel like a leech to my parents. I just can\\'t bring myself to start working, because it seems to be this huge terrifying place where people are yelling at me what to do, and if i mess up i\\'m going to be punished, in the social sense. I have this screwed up idea of how the world works, even though i haven\\'t been outside... at all. It\\'s like something i rely on and believe is true even if i agree that the world doesn\\'t work that way. It\\'s hard unsticking myself from it... This is rambly. Anyways, the stupid thing is, if i force myself to go outside, and for example, take a walk... then after i\\'m done with it it doesn\\'t feel that bad. I feel, okay, i can handle this, this wasn\\'t as bad as i thought. So clearly i just have to force myself out to experience it even if it wrecks me. It\\'s still really difficult. While inside, shielded from the outside world, a (figurative) voice in the back of my head tells me that the outside world is still scary, and the times i\\'ve been taking a walk doesn\\'t matter. I feel like i\\'m completely submitting myself to the inner fear, \\'ego\\', whatever whenever this happens. It tells me that i should feel scared, and worry about things, and think \"what if\"... it fools me in to thinking that it\\'s for my own best. I can recognize this yet i feel powerless to change it. Until i actually take the first step, which feels like the hardest thing in the universe, and it dissolves right in front of me. I recently did an experiment with my boyfriend, where, when he would be brutally honest and criticize my bad habits (which i\\'m thankful for) i would stop fighting and just \"give up\", something i fear a whole lot. Whenever someone would criticize me, i would feel a need to fight back, in order to prove myself, to not be seen as weak, or whatever. I gave up and admitted that i was wrong, and it gave me such a relaxed feeling that i have never felt before. It felt like i could finally relax my muscles, and stop worrying about what he, or other people thought about me, and as a consequence i didn\\'t feel any social anxiety, or any anxiety for that matter. I think this \\'ego\\' is the root of the problem, making me worry about behaving in a \"good\" way, so that people will like me. This makes sense as when i was a child/teen, people used to avoid me for some reason. So at least i have something to work with. I hate worrying about things way too much, i hate thinking about things in circles before even doing something, i hate thinking i know how it\\'s gonna play out even if it never does. I never am right in my predictions and yet i think it\\'s the safest way to go. It\\'s stupid. I wish i could do something as simple as getting a job, and handle my own life, but i can\\'t.

My main fear when I'm in public is that I will meet or be noticed by someone I know, causing them to make false assumptions about me depending on my location and situation. E.g if someone sees me walking in a bad neighborhood, I'm afraid of them assuming I'm a criminal When I am in public WITH a friend, however, it's much easier and I get less anxiety. I freak out when I am called on by the teacher to read or present in front of the class. When my class is taking turns reading out loud, I will quickly skim through the paragraph before everyone else to prepare in case I get picked to read next When I present to the class, I stutter and can't keep my body still (moving my hands excessively, walking around, etc.) Unless they are my close friends or family, I stutter and tend to look down when I'm having a conversation with another person. I get anxiety when making or receiving phone calls. When I receive a call, I ignore it and later text the person saying that I was busy I reread my emails and make revisions several times before sending them. When I want to say something out loud to another person or a group of people, I repeat the sentence in my head a few times to make sure the wording doesn't sound wrong.

Anyway, here goes: I feel like some kind of imposter here, I haven\\'t been diagnosed with anything, but I know there is something wrong with me. Where to begin... So, I think I could be described as a quiet, shy, introverted (I know being shy and introverted are two different things), and reserved person. I always have been, so far, at least. I\\'m 15. It goes a little further than that though. I\\'m incredibly socially awkward, and I really don\\'t know what to say a lot of the time. If a conversation dies out, I feel like it\\'s all my fault because I\\'m not interesting. I\\'ve avoided Skype calls with a close friend numerous times because of this, and I feel like every time I decline a request to call, they\\'ll stop being my friend. Like they\\'ll hate me or something, even though I know that\\'s bizarre. Also, I have friends I\\'ve met online that I\\'ve known for well over a year now, and I even feel uncomfortable talking in calls with them, so I usually lie and say that I can\\'t talk right now, and just type instead. I also hate going outside, ever since I was a kid. My sister loved(s) going to the park; I didn\\'t want to, I wanted stay inside all day, but my mum made me go. But recently it\\'s gotten worse. A lot worse. I took a day off school two weeks ago. I pretended to be sick. Long story short, I\\'m not exactly in a happy place right now, and I just couldn\\'t go in. Fake smiling, fake laughing - I was sick of it. Then there\\'s also, what I can only presume, are panic/anxiety attacks (quickened breathing, shaky hands, tight throat). Which is kind of why I\\'m here. I\\'ve only ever had one of these (I think) months ago, way back at the start of 2016 in my house. And that sucked like hell. Now I\\'ve started to get them at school. They usually occur just after a maths lesson has finished. I just get this overwhelming feeling of fear, and all I could think was \"What the fuck is wrong with me? I need to get out of here now,\" and \"There\\'s nothing wrong with you, it\\'s all in your head; man up.\" \"Man up\" - that phrase has been drilled into me. After the bell goes and we get to leave, I usually go straight to the toilets in one of cubicles and stay there for 5-10 minutes (during break/lunch break) to calm down. Then I have to leave so I don\\'t look weird and my friend(s) ask me where I\\'ve been. That brings me to today, I pretended to be sick again today to have the day off. Same reasons - unhappy and panic/anxiety attacks. I also feel constantly uncomfortable in social situations (so, all 6 hours of school. Yay), I have a big fear of judgement of others and base my self-worth on that - which is why I have very little of that, but also self-esteem and confidence. I only ever feel normal (mostly) when alone, and even then I\\'m thinking how I have to get up at an absurdly early time in the morning to go to a school I hate and talk to people when I\\'d rather shut myself in all day.

            "{'sequence': '(\\' High school baggage (self-therapy; long rambling). I\\'m trying to work through some stuff in my own head, so no one needs to read or reply to this. I visited my high school on the pretext of seeing the new renovations, but I actually just wanted to feel like I could walk everywhere without fear. Even though I graduated five years ago, I still felt nervous. Even though the school is on winter break and campus was empty, I found myself hesitant to walk where there were usually people. Even five years later, my automatic reaction was to walk away the moment I thought I heard someone and to put on my practiced facial expression as if someone were watching me. I was still scared to walk around campus, but I made myself do it (albeit there was no one there), telling myself that this is my campus too, that I didn\\'t have to run away and that I have a right to be there. High school was about hiding. During lunch, I sat behind pillars and bushes, in bathrooms, classrooms and locker rooms. I walked quickly from class to class with my head down. I stayed in a corner in the library as much as I could. I didn\\'t have a single friend in high school in spite of my initial efforts to reach out to people. I joined a soccer team; I quit because of the name-calling. I joined voice lessons; I quit because of the name-calling. On my first day of class in my first year, someone came to sit next to me, but his friend pulled him away saying loudly, \"I\\'m not sitting next to *her*.\" These were all people I\\'d never met, I was totally new to the school district. In math class, my table group never worked problems with me. Instead, they ignored me, talking to each other in another language, sometimes about me, not even realizing that I understood everything they said. A few times, I tried to sit with people during lunch, people I had met and managed to talk to in a friendly way during class, but they all got up and left together each time. Of course I had to save my dignity and stop acting desperate. From day one, I was marked as a pariah. I don\\'t know why or how I became the constant outcast except that I was new to the district. But for four years, I couldn\\'t eat before or at school. I developed a binge-eating disorder, which still comes up once in a while. I shut down and did nothing but academically-oriented work, never going to a social situation, except prom, which my parents forced me to attend. Those same people I had talked to before said I could join them, probably because it would be rude to say no outright. But of course they walked away and avoided me the whole event. Visiting the high school campus was painful. Objectively, I know that all of this is in the past and that I should be able to move on. But the reality is that the SA that I face every day is in large part due to the ostracizing and name-calling from high school. The past is still a living part of the present. I thought that by visiting campus, I could get some closure. Instead, it\\'s dredged up all the stuff I try not to think about. The only thing I can say is that I can see a bit more clearly what my behavioral pattern is--hiding and making myself as invisible as possible because if they can\\'t see you, they can\\'t hurt you. But I\\'ve gotten so used to making myself as invisible and unobtrusive as possible that I can\\'t make friends. I\\'ve never dated. The one time I mustered the courage to ask a guy to hang out with me, he invited his roommate to join, making it a group activity and proceeded to leave me with her. Writing that out makes me realize how calculated that was; that was actually quite mean. I\\'m always on the defense from people and their attention. But all of this isolation hurts. I\\'m hurting myself in the present because other people hurt me in the past and because I\\'m convinced that people will hurt me in the future. I don\\'t know how I can try anymore.

Here is some more background info for anyone who may be able to give me any good advice, I would really appreciate it. I\\'m a 20 yr old female and I fell in love a couple years ago and moved countries for my boyfriend, we are still together and i believe things are much better than before. You have no idea how hard this move has been on me. I used to be so happy and outgoing and have my close few friends and old high school friends. I used to do my own thing, I used to be so independent. First let me say that I love my boyfriend incredibly and we both plan to spend the rest of our lives together and have a family, build our home and we are already working on our business together. It has been a couple years and I still don\\'t know how to speak the language here. I do not have a car or a drivers license and I work from home. I feel I am so reliant on him for everything. I feel I am so needy and attached to him always. We spend every day together and yes we take our space but I wouldn\\'t want it any different. Now with the crime etc here and with how I stand out we both aren\\'t comfortable with me taking the bus let alone running in the area we live. This is another problem. I know a group of people that speak English and we sort of get along but I feel no matter what I do not click with any of the girls here. I have always had troubles being friends with girls though, they don\\'t seem to take a liking to me and I\\'ve accepted that and continue to be as nice and genuine as possible. I used to have a bunch of guy friends but now that I am in a serious relationship ( I should note this is my first relationship ) I don\\'t think that it is very appropriate to make close guy friends but I get along well with my boyfriend\\'s friends though. With the language I\\'ve been excusing it and excusing it and Now that I live here I feel I have become shy because I hate being laughed at for not knowing the language, I get so much anxiety when we are out and there is lots of people and my boyfriend is talking to people I don\\'t seem to recognize or know, or even people I do know and it\\'s in their own language and I just close in and feel so alone and so invisible to everyone. I try to learn a bit but guess I get frustrated and shut down easily. I am forcing myself to pay for 1on1 private lessons though and I feel this is a huge block that is one of the main problems for me. I hate being the center of attention as well and I think that I am a very insecure woman now that I am in this relationship. The way I think about myself can at times be terrible, I\\'m great for overthinking and my poor boyfriend gets to deal with it all. I know that from a young age because of dad issues or whatever I have abandonment problems and although I think my boyfriend would never and know that he has never done anything behind my back involving another woman I still feel like I will lose him at times and I feel like i am not good enough. As you can probably tell I have serious insecurities about myself, what I believe are abandonment issues, social anxiety, a language barrier, I am too dependent on him, uncomfortable to walk the streets alone, a hard time making friends, a hard time even going out of my comfort zone, sometimes suffer from bouts of depression etc and it is hard on both me and my boyfriend. I broke down yesterday because I was holding it all in for so long and I didn\\'t want my boyfriend to know because honestly he is so used to me crying I feel like it doesn\\'t even phase him but he came in the room and I couldnt hide it anymore and he actually cried with me because he couldn\\'t believe how I was feeling about myself etc. But today we went to an event and it was so overwhelming for me there was so many people and I started panicking inside and tried to keep it to myself but he sensed it and then as we were leaving I asked if he wanted to get a beer before we went to this other event (work) and he said no and that we had to go to that event right away but then he saw his friend opened a bar and we went to say hi and the guys completely ignored me and they all talked to eachother in their language and again it hit me and I felt so worthless to be standing there just looking at the ground trying to keep it together and then he asks me if we can have a beer with them and that stung because I just got turned down when I asked. We ended up leaving anyway and he noticed I was a little upset and I asked him about the beer thing and the friends who wouldn\\'t even look at me and then he started getting pissed off and He makes this comment \"why can\\'t we go just one day without it turning bad \" and I started crying and there was a point I was upset with him and said fuck you and had a short rant and he said \"you don\\'t even try to get better\" \"I don\\'t deserve this\" \"I can\\'t even say hi to my friends\", he totally lost his cool and was yelling and speeding at times and I just kept fucking crying, he also asked why for once I can\\'t make it all about me and even though i feel he took things way too far I understand and I feel like a peice of shit and am so upset with myself. Please why can\\'t I be fucking normal again I feel almost trapped right now but when I\\'m good things are amazing but no when he tells me that stuff I just feel like it would be better if I just left for good. I am hurting so much. Please someone help talk to me I have no one to go to and he was the only one I poured my heart and soul to. He knows everything about me, but when he goes and says this I feel like he just doesn\\'t care and I feel I\\'d be better off gone. But when I think about it he is my everything. He is all I have.

            "{'sequence': \"('What is it?. Hi, I'm a 22 year old male from the UK. It has just hit me that I might be suffering from some form of social anxiety. I know it's not something you can easily diagnose, as being shy is common and often just a stage in someones life, but I think it's more than shyness for me. I can speak to other people fine, and will smile at the barista or laugh with somebody if the situation is so, so I wouldn't class myself as shy. I can hold a conversation with a stranger well enough. What I think is my problem is that I always feel like I have to prepare myself before I go out. Regardless of how well I think I'm dressed, or whether I have a fresh haircut or whatever, I feel unready to be in the gaze of others if I'm not physically and mentally prepared. If I don't know that I'm being looked at/am in the presence of others or if I'm not prepared mentally to be looked at/to be in the presence of others, I feel very uncomfortable. Don't ask me what my mental preparation is, because I have no clue. My physical preparation is fairly normal for a young male, it's just the mental side. I also just always feel like I'm being watched when I'm walking in public. Like everyone I pass stares at me for a second longer than they do at other people, because I don't fit in. Truth is, I look 'normal'. I'm from an ethnic minority, but who the hell cares about that (especially at uni). I don't think I look particularly attractive or unattractive. The issue came to fruition in Uni, when I began to be out and about more generally. I was a bit overweight, but not by majorly so, and my self-consciousness with that made me hate being in public. I'd want to be out of sight as soon as possible, and it was like a massive burden was lifted off my shoulders when I'd reach my room. Since then I've lost a lot of weight so that I'm really like any other young adult male (if a bit on the skinny side, but that's because I'm into running), and yet the feeling of being out of place still hasn't changed. I'm still at uni (in my final year), and it has improved a lot. Losing weight helped, and generally becoming more comfortable with how I look. I think that was one of my major problems. I was very self conscious with my looks. I hated the way I looked with glasses because I thought it made me look even weirder, to the extent that I wouldn't wear glasses when my prescription is such that I should wear them all the time. I'd rather be basically blind and live in a blur than to look that extra bit weirder. That continued on for a long while, until I realised that it was affecting how people I knew thought of me because they'd pass right by me or wave at me and I'd blank them because I couldn't see them. That's different now, I think I've come to terms with my image. I look different, but I'm fine with that because we all do, and I'm no beast or whatever. I'm a lot more comfortable in public too and will go out even when I don't particularly need to, but there's still that something that makes me falter before I go out in the morning, and sometimes I don't even want to leave my room. That is what has made me think that there's something more to my condition than just having body image issues. There's no better feeling than getting back into my room and being out of sight after a long day at uni. I read somewhere that this is just a symptom of being an introvert, but I don't think I am your usual introvert. I enjoy meeting new people, and sometimes I really crave it. It's not social interactions that exhaust me, because I get this need to hide away after simply being out and having not even talked to anyone. So is this the right place for me? Do you think I have social anxiety issues? I don't think it is the body image issues that I've had in years gone by, but then again I've never really looked for professional help for anything like this. I don't know.. honestly I'd just be glad if there was someone else who had the same issues, someone that I could to talk to about them? Thanks for reading all of that. It's the first time I've ever actually typed out my feelings about it, and really is a relief in itself, so thanks for being a part of that even if there is nothing you can suggest.')\", 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect', 'outdoor activity or space with positive effect', 'outdoor activity or space with negative effect'], 'scores': [0.39756616950035095, 0.32506778836250305, 0.277366042137146]}\n",

            "{'sequence': '(\\'22M, live abroad is killing me. Hello reddit, I moved to Europe, when I was 14. My mother already lived there for 3 years and I lived in Ukraine with my grandparents. I was never really asked if I wanted to move but I also didn\\'t think about living in other country and leaving everything behind as a big problem. First half of the year was a horror. I spoke to almost no one. I learned German for a year prior to moving to Europe and it was not enough for me to instantly make friends. Also, the last couple of years at school in Ukraine were pretty difficult for me, as I was constantly bullied. I was weak and skinny and didn\\'t know how to protect myself. But even then, I didn\\'t have any other problems outside school. So, back to Europe, from my first days here, I tried to speak to my new schoolmates as good as I could. But I also started to shield myself from people. Like, if I try to look unfriendly or dangerous, nobody will try to make fun of me. I behaved myself like this, when I was in public. It\\'s not, like I was being impolite to people, but I tried to always have this \"don’t mess with me look\", if this makes any sense. However, knew country, new rules. I didn\\'t have to be afraid of being attacked physically. Instead I couldn’t argue or counter jokes from my classmates. This time I was vulnerable not, because I was weak, but because I didn\\'t know the language well. I also went to a second school simultaneously. My week looked like this: twice a week a returned home at 8pm, because of two schools, where I hadn\\'t time to go home between them. The rest of time I had to study. My first winter holidays, which I spent back in Ukraine, were both a relieve and a horror. I had to go privately to a German teacher almost daily. In first summer I had about 3-4 teachers to prepare me for both schools. All this was awful, but stilly I had my friends at home and was overall happy. **Until one day it started.** I was going back from my German teacher (who was a really nice person, and who taught me really a lot grammar, that helped me immense with my German, so it\\'s not like I totally hated learning German). But let\\'s go back. So, I was going back from my \"class\". I was a usual way for me: just a bit uphill along the road towards the bus stop. Suddenly it was more difficult for me to breath and I felt like, if I would start breath more, people would notice it and, that I looked really awkward. After that, I drove back home and felt myself completely normal. But this situation repeated itself more and more during that summer. I started to notice the way I breathe even on my way to the teacher. I think, this is where it all started. As I was back in Europe, I started being conscious about how I move my feet or my arms. I was always aware of where I was looking at, how my lip was positioned. I didn\\'t know how to look in people\\'s eyes, whether I looked unfriendly etc. I still had no friends at European school, I haven\\'t had any walks which I had constantly with my friends back in Ukraine. It looked like the kids where either going out the way I didn\\'t understand or the didn\\'t do it at all. Years went by, the only time I enjoyed my life, was when I had winter or summer holidays and was back in Ukraine. There I could talk to people, I even managed to make new friends, with whom I still have good contact. I just felt myself normal. After about 2-3 years later, I managed to tell my mother, that something was wrong with me. (It\\'s not easy for a kid to admit, that something is wrong with his head! And I didn\\'t have a good connection to my mother at that time) She took me to her psychiatrist. I was prescribed with some weak antidepressant. I guess I helped with my mood a bit, but it had done shit to my social anxiety. I just tried to suppress the way I felt and had from time to time breakdowns. My only dream was to finish school and University and leave that fucking country. Since no one here needed me, I decided, I would manage everything on my own. I finished both schools. It may sound like it isn\\'t bad after all. Well, no. All this time it felt like I lost that autopilot and had to manually control the way I move, or where to look at the person I speak to. I still didn\\'t feel connected to people around me. I could not make jokes, which the class would find funny. I didn\\'t speak to anyone outside my class. I felt isolated and people around me perceived me the same way. I wasn\\'t interested in my future carrier or, in what to study. My only dream was to leave this country. Instead of leaving, I thought, that it would be a waste to give up an opportunity to study in Europe. I also didn\\'t want to disappoint my relatives. And, to be honest, I was afraid to change anything, go back home and take exams to be able study there. I also didn\\'t want to look like an idiot, coming back, when everybody else wanted to leave Ukraine for better future. I think, I should have done that. If not for studying, but just to have a year off, relax, get rid of SA and may be come back to study. (It\\'s important to mention, that most of the social anxiety symptoms weaken, after I get back home for, at least a month. But even from the first day on, I always felt myself a lot better ) But I haven\\'t done that. Instead I thought, I could power myself thought University, get a bachelor and leave this fucking country forever. I tried studying two different faculties, I hoped, that at the University I would finally able to connect to new people and have fun (so that I would even decide to stay in Europe). That never happened. I tried to study mechanical engineering, but from the beginning the math was just unmanageable for me and I couldn’t find a group to study together. Well, if I can\\'t have fun talking to someone new, since I am to anxious, I can\\'t fit in a group to study, because you must speak there and, like, make friends :) In Europe there are no persistent classes at the Universities. You either have a lection in a huge auditorium or have smaller classes, with 20-40 persons for something like practicing math, where you must solve your prepared homework in front of whole group. I had to do it twice and I felt almost like I am fainting. The most time I spent at home, where I didn\\'t have to feel constant fear and be in fight or flight mode. During one summer in Ukraine I met my current girlfriend. Later, I decided to study CS at a so-called University of Applied Science, where after three years of fixed classes I would have my bachelor and could go back to Ukraine. I had to wait almost a year to sign me up for that University. In the meantime, I found a job, where I am basically all levels of support and a junior sysadmin at same time. (Back in European school a had a specialization in IT because of which we had one year more of school. And the specialization made me hate IT so much, that I didn\\'t realize, that I actually like it) The job was fantastic the only \"problem\" was, that every year in August they organized an event for different political, technical, economical, etc topics) and I had to be there for month. During that time I had both to do IT Stuff and help prepare everything for the conference (cheap student labor :D) But that one month of constant work (not 8/5) just crushed me. My anxiety escalated to some new levels, I was constantly stressed. I was still extra anxious after work but also looked forward to study something I wanted, the way I thought could be the best for me. I expected, that only mathematics would be hard for me, but I also knew you that it would not be as difficult as in a normal University. I was so fucking wrong about everything. The amount of information was huge. We had constant projects in most of the classes. Moreover, there are supposed to be a lot of group projects. The groups where created all by themselves. I didn\\'t want to be that person without a group and be assigned to somebody I didn\\'t like. All of this made me extremely anxious. Additionally, to my social anxiety I became anxious about everything else. I had to finish every assignment, otherwise I would fail either the final project or the test and then after 3 repeat I would have to repeat the semester. And if you didn\\'t manage to do the first assignment, you will still have to do it, since every next assignment is built upon previous. But most important, I could not manage to make social contacts. I was truly afraid of people. It seems, like we have no similar interests. I still do not know how to connect to them. People in Europe just feel so alien to me. Here in Europe, at my University I felt like a totally different person. I had a lot of breakdowns, I started to cry in the evening and I somehow managed to survive till end of the December and have two weeks off, during which I had to prepare for math exam. But still I was in Ukraine with my girlfriend. What was really killing me is, that I still can perfectly speak to my Ukrainian friends, we can argue, discuss stuff, make fun of each other etc. I have a very nice and understanding girlfriend. I have no problems socializing with them. Or even with meeting new people in Ukraine. After final exams my girlfriend was here with me in Europe, and I still could not relax. When we were in public I constantly was afraid, that I cannot protect her, due to my SA. I also failed two exams and had to retake them after holidays, which made me even more anxious. My doctor gave me some new medication, which, for two weeks seemed to lower my social anxiety and it felt awesome. I already lost my belief that there could be any meds that could really help me. And that belief was restored. The only thing I feared, is that it won\\'t hold, like with all previous things that seemed to help me. And, well, it didn\\'t hold. Something happened during the weekends, I can\\'t explain what it is. But it set me off. My fear became true. The amount of work for the University increased even more and became unbearable to me. At this point I cry for hours. Last week I spent home, constantly anxious. At this point, I don\\'t know what to do. I should have left this country for a year after school. Now I feel, like I can\\'t do it. I also feel, like I am already too old to stop studying and make a pause. I don\\'t think, that I will be able to finish this semester, since I have already fallen behind all the classes. I also get very anxious if I try to study and more anxious after every minor difficulty. My relatives think, that it wasn’t that bad previously. I think, I just was very good at suppressing it and just can\\'t take it anymore. When I felt myself worse, I was usually prescribed new medication, talked to the therapist. After that I felt a bit better and it was enough to continue suppressing and working on \"more\" important things. How long can a person live in a foreign country feeling lonely? I know, that there are people, to whom I am interesting, who like me and care about me. My family is also very supportive. But it\\'s not them, who feel anxious about going outside. It\\'s me who is constantly afraid of masses of people, who can\\'t relax outside and can\\'t protect myself from. Any verbal or nonverbal assault. It almost feels like I am at a warzone. I remember, when I didn\\'t care, how people look at me, ignored if somebody was rude to me. I was able to respond the way I wanted. My head wasn\\'t empty. Now I just slowly fall apart. I am not suicidal, I guess, because I don\\'t believe in the afterlife and am afraid of death. Hell, I even was more relaxed during this two weeks in Ukraine in winter. It wasn\\'t enough time, but I felt myself free on the streets. You probably gonna say, why the hell wouldn\\'t I leave. I know, people would support my decision, I could probably come back later. But I don\\'t won\\'t to let down my girlfriend, even if she says, I don\\'t. I didn\\'t finish a university, so nobody would really want to have me work for them and I want to work, so that I won\\'t be an abuse. I know my options. I just don\\'t have the will to make a decision. I feel like I would get better a bit, like usual and would continue ignoring the problem and maybe in 5 years will slowly finish CS at the University. I just don\\'t think, it is going to be a life. Maybe you together with my girlfriend, it would be easier. I don\\'t know, why am I even writing this. I don’t know, whether it’s a right subreddit. Even posting something on the internet makes me anxious. I do not know, what I want to hear from you. Therefore, I will just share this story and hope for something. I also hope, I won’t be deanonymized by somebody. I just feel, like for the last 8 years, I lived only episodically, not being able to open my true potential or take the opportunities, I was given. And I feel like I am slowly going insane. I hope, that this text isn\\'t totally unreadable, since I guess, English is not even my second language . I tried to keep it as short as possible, but I also don’t expect, that anybody would like to read almost 3k words text. **TL;DR** A lot of autobiographical stuff. Moving abroad as a kid literally ruined my nervous system as the years passed by. And my will was never strong enough to decide, what is really important for me and to change my life the way I really wanted. Now, I just can\\'t take my social anxiety anymore and overcome any difficulties of being an adult. The difference between, who I am in one country, and who I am in another is just killing me.\\')', 'labels': ['outdoor activity or space with negative effect', 'outdoor activity or space with neutral or no effect', 'outdoor activity or space with positive effect'], 'scores': [0.34269043803215027, 0.3348623812198639, 0.32244712114334106]}\n",

I didn\\'t catch anyone sitting on their porch during my walk. However, I have these thoughts like \"What if I see my neighbors sitting on their porch? Should I say hello to them? Should I wave? What if they ignore me? What if I don\\'t speak and they think I\\'m ignorant or rude? What if they think I\\'m weird?\" I don\\'t like being observed by people. It makes me uncomfortable. Whenever my father observes me doing something he always judges or makes fun of the way I walk. He tells me I walk very stiff. Because of that I\\'m self-conscious of the way I walk. I always feel like people are judging the way I walk. He gives me a hard time and gets angry with me for looking nervous or uncomfortable when we\\'re out sometimes. This is why I always feel like people can sense that I\\'m nervous and are going to judge me negatively. My father always tells me, \"You have to always watch your surroundings when you\\'re out. You have to walk with your head up and your chest out. You can\\'t appear weak or scared, because people will try to harm you if you appear vulnerable.\" This is why I\\'m always a little paranoid when I\\'m out of my house or being watched by people, because I don\\'t want them to think I\\'m weak and I don\\'t want them to treat me like I\\'m nothing because of it or try to harm me. Sorry if this is all over the place, but all in all I hate being watched or observed by people. This stems from a lot of the things my father tells me.

            "{'sequence': \"('My Social Anxiety. I wrote this as a bit of a vent for myself but thought I would post it here because I’m sure many of you can relate to this. It’s a bit long but here goes... As a kid I was always “shy.” I wouldn’t make direct eye contact with people most of the time. I would put my head down in situations where I had to meet new people. At family gatherings I would mostly keep to myself only talking to people if they asked me a question. Even then, it would usually be a short response. In school I didn’t have many friends. I had more in elementary than I did in middle school. More in middle school than in high school. I can count the number of real friends I had in high school on one hand. It sure didn’t help that I went to three different high schools throughout my high school years. One of those I left and returned to a few times. I changed elementary schools in the 4th grade, and then changed middle school in the beginning of 7th grade. So it didn’t make it any easier to make friends with people that already had established groups of friends that they had grown up with. I remember hearing this girl in my class talking to her friends about how it was weird that we keep leaving and coming back. (We being my sister and I) In high school people thought I was rude or mean because I didn’t talk to anyone. The truth is I just didn’t know how. I wanted to have friends. I didn’t want to be popular or anything but who doesn’t want to have their own circle of friends and people to relate to? Even the people I “dated” didn’t get to know the real me because I was too afraid to be myself. I don’t know why I felt this way. I’m sure it has something to do with my developmental years but I’m not an expert. Going to school every day was hell. Thinking that everyone is judging you all the time or talking about you or laughing at you is rough. Being made fun of for being “too skinny” or “too quiet” or “too rude” is rough. I would walk in every morning with headphones in and make a beeline for the classroom and I would leave the same way. I wonder if you know what this social anxiety feels like? It can come and go at anytime. Some days are worse than others. Some days it’s insomnia, heart racing, palms sweating, mind racing. It’s uncontrollable and it feels like you’re mind is going to explode from the craziness inside it. Some days it lurks in the background. On those days it’s manageable. You can go to the movies or to the mall and feel somewhat okay. Some days it’s canceling plans you’ve had for weeks because you just can’t bring yourself to leave the house and face human interaction. You can’t face the feeling of everyone’s eyes on you and the negativity that you assume is associated with you. You can’t force yourself to act like you’ve got it together in front of other people. It’s too hard to put on a smile and make conversation. The hardest part for me is self doubt. I’m always second guessing what I’m doing. Always thinking someone is watching. Always afraid of messing up. It’s also people thinking I’m lazy because I don’t work and when I do it never lasts too long. Even the job I have now which is a good job with good pay, it’s hard. It’s hard forcing myself out of bed in the morning knowing for the next twelve hours I’m going to be mentally exhausted which is much worse than the physical exhaustion. That may seem like an over statement to you but it’s not for me. Walking down the long walk ways at work hoping no ones walking the opppsite direction. What do I do when I cross someone’s path? Do I make eye contact? Do I look straight ahead? Do I smile? Nod? Wave? Am I rude if I just look down or away? These are all thoughts going through my head. As irrational as they are, they’re real. What happens when everyone is standing in a group talking? Do I go and try to be part of the group? But then I have to talk to people. But if I don’t I just look like a weirdo or like I think I’m too good to talk to them. What if I think I know how to do something at work but I’m not sure and I’m afraid to mess up so I ask someone for help? Then I feel dumb because I should’ve just done what I thought was right in the first place. Sometimes I avoid doing things altogether just so I can’t fail and look dumb in front of my co workers. But doing nothing also makes me look lazy and like I’m not a team player. Do you understand the problem? This is also the reason I don’t drive. I know I’m capable of driving and would probably enjoy it, but I’m terrified of taking the driving test. I can’t bring myself to go and be on the spot like that. I don’t even want to drive in front of my fiancé so how am I supposed to do it for a test in front of a stranger? Everyone tells me you need to get your license. It’s such an obvious and easy thing for everyone else but for me it’s the hardest thing in the world. It’s the same reason I wouldn’t cut the grass when I was younger. I didn’t want people to watch me out in the front yard anyone passing by could and I didnt want to mess up and cut it poorly. I hope this will help you understand what this anxiety is like for me. It’s not getting better. In fact it’s gotten worse. I’m getting more general anxiety now. Unreasonable worrying about things I have no control over. Checking to see if my loved ones are still breathing when they sleep or worrying about getting into car accidents. Living with this anxiety is getting harder and harder. All I want to do is give up and just lay in bed at home in a safe place all the time. I’m looking into getting help because this is too much to handle and I just want to feel normal for the first time in my life.

However this incident has made my anxiety worse, and I\\'ve never really recovered since. When I was young, I used to always be a teacher\\'s pet. Teachers used to love me, and I was always their favorite student. I used to always get special acknowledgment from teachers because of this. In 8th grade (2010-2011 school year) I had a history teacher. At the beginning of the school year he would acknowledge me and give me attention. However, one day after lunch I was walking to his classroom to get to his class. I was down the hall and he was at the door. I guess I was walking a little slow and he yelled, \"Devin hurry up!\". (Looking back on it he didn\\'t even say it in an angry way and I\\'m mad at myself for letting that get to me.) Ever since that incident I felt like he was mad at me and he didn\\'t like me. Because of this I was always desperate for his approval again. However, I never got it! He never acknowledged me or called on me in class ever! He would acknowledge all of his students except for me. I would stare him down in the hallway or in his classroom hoping he would say something to me, but he never did. I didn\\'t like how every one else got attention from him except for me. I even raised my hand once in his class to answer a question, and he looked at me and didn\\'t call on me! All I wanted was his approval. I have never been treated like this by a teacher before, so it was hard for me to take. I was so used to being a teacher\\'s favorite student. He pretty much ignored me the entire school year. Because of this incident, I\\'m now desperate for approval from everyone! When I go shopping I get upset when an employee chooses to acknowledge the person I\\'m with and not me. When people choose to acknowledge someone else over me I get jealous! I struggle making eye contact with people! I\\'m very sensitive to how people look at me and what people think about me! It\\'s hard for me to relax in public! It\\'s like I want approval from everyone! If I don\\'t get it I get upset and feel like there\\'s something wrong with me. Before the incident with my History teacher, I never had these issues! I\\'m so upset because I feel like if it wasn\\'t for that situation, my anxiety wouldn\\'t be so bad now and I wouldn\\'t have all these issues. Ever since this incident, my anxiety has been horrible! My anxiety was never this bad prior to this incident. I just feel like I will never be the same person I was before 8th grade. I still had anxiety, but I was able to enjoy life more and interacting with people didn\\'t make me so anxious. Now my anxiety is debilitating. Every time I go outside I instantly get nervous. When people look at me or when cars drive by me I get uncomfortable. I just feel like I will never get better and I\\'m going to spend the rest of my life being a people pleaser with crippling anxiety.

Hello, This is going to be a little long, but please take the time to read this. I don’t know what to do. I’m not trying to gain sympathy or pity, I just need to pour my heart out. I’m 20. I’m a boy. I have social anxiety. It’s something I struggled with my whole life. In school I was always quiet because I was very shy. Students used to always ask me “Why are you so quiet?” Teachers would call my parents and tell them “Your son is very quiet.” My parents would get mad at me because of it. When we would visit family, I was always quiet and in my shell. They would ask me, “Why are you so quiet? You can open up.” I was always shy and uncomfortable around family I didn’t see very often. My father always scolded me after we visited his family for being so quiet and acting uncomfortable around them. I spent a lot of time in the house. My father never liked that. He always wanted me to go outside and play with the other kids in the neighborhood, but I never wanted to out of fear. He would always give me a hard time for always being alone and not having friends. He would say, “You’re always alone, you have no friends.” I know I don’t have any friends and I’m always alone. It was very hurtful to listen to him and hear that, but he’s right. The truth hurts. He still says it to this day. I would talk to people in school, but I would never hang out with them outside of school. I couldn’t take that next step. And people never wanted to hang out with me anyway. They would never ask me if I wanted to hang out with them. They never asked for my phone number. I could never open up to people. I was always awkward and uncomfortable with other students in school. They definitely picked up on that. I went to the same school district since third grade, and I don’t have a single friend from there. My anxiety hit rock bottom out of nowhere during my freshman year of high school. It could be attributed to the fact I was going through puberty and my hormones were raging or it just progressively got worse. I started developing so many issues that were not a problem prior. I started having a hard time making eye contact with people. Being sensitive to how people look at me. If I get dirty looks from someone or a weird look, I feel like something is wrong with me and I’m devastated. When I’m out for a walk and someone is approaching me I either put my face down and look at the ground to avoid eye contact or I try to make the effort to make eye contact with the passerby, but they just look at me funny and I feel awkward. Going out for car rides and feeling like people in other cars are looking at me and judging me. Going out for walks with other people around. People noticing that I’m nervous or uncomfortable and judging me for it. Walking into a room full of people with all eyes on me. Always feeling like people are staring at me and judging me. Just so many issues that became so severe. I always had anxiety, but during my freshman year of high school my anxiety got much worse. Prior to this, my anxiety wasn’t that bad. I was more care-free. It was easier for me to interact with people. I was able to enjoy life more. The issues I started developing weren’t much of an issue in the past. I became so upset that my anxiety gotten worse. I let my mind convince myself that I’m never going to get better. I’m doomed to have social anxiety for the rest of my life. I’m never going to be able to go back to how I was before my freshman year of high school. Going out period around other people became too anxiety inducing for me, so I became a shut-in. I went through the rest of high school with debilitating anxiety. During sophomore year, I started eating lunch in the counseling office because eating in the cafeteria with all the other students became too overwhelming for me. I always walked with a book in my hand for a comfort. I was and still am very self-conscious of the way I walk. People say I walk very stiff or like a robot. Going to school everyday made me extremely nervous. Sitting in the classroom amongst other students and feeling like everyone is staring at me. Walking the hallways. Giving presentations. High school was hell. However I made it through and I graduated. I started college and I didn’t have the college experience. I struggled with anxiety. I just stayed in my dorm all day and did nothing. I didn’t make any friends, join any clubs/organizations, party, etc. I was too afraid to open up. I was too afraid to step outside of my comfort zone and make friends and just have fun. People would try to be my friend, but I was never comfortable. Everyone around me was having the time of their lives, making friends, etc. It was depressing because I wasn’t having any of that. I don’t even want to go back to school next year. I have no life. I just sit in the house all day everyday. I don’t work because I’m too afraid to get a job. How am I going to get through the interview? What if my coworkers won’t like me? What if my manager won’t like me? What if customers or my coworkers think I’m weird because I’m socially awkward? I try to get out of the house, but being out just makes me nervous. I want to have friends and I want to have a life. I feel like I have so much to offer, I just need to get past this awful fear. I go on social media and look at people I went to school with. They are having the time of their lives while I sit on my behind and do nothing. It’s upsetting. I have no personality. I feel like a robot. Everytime I interact with people in public I’m very stiff and robotic. People tell me I’m extremely nice, but honestly I feel like I have no personality. I can’t open up to people. I’m never comfortable and I’m always on edge. I’m living in fear. I just feel like I’m doomed to have social anxiety for the rest of my life. It has gotten so severe to the point where I don’t think I can ever recover. Sorry for the long post, but I needed to pour my feelings out. I’m sick of people telling me I’m just a lazy bum.

People tell me that I shouldn’t just say “I wish this” and “I wish that” and that I should just get over it or do something about it. One, frack you guys who say “just get over it”, you’ve probably never dealt with anxiety, it’s like you are carrying the weight of everyone’s judgements and eyes on you with every possibility of any and every event running through your head all the time. It’s traumatic and we live with it everyday and in the end some of us can’t take it any longer, we can’t stand the pressure of living under the umbrella of our own minds. Two, you think I’m not dealing with it? I’ve done therapy, I’ve had over half a dozen different therapists and psychologists, I’ve done the meds and meditation and I still spent over half my junior year of high school locked in my bedroom crying and trying not to end it while my mother thought I just had mono and was “tired”. I am trying, I force myself outside and to interact but it’s terrifying and people just don’t seem to get that. When you’ve lived your whole life with these voices in your head telling you that you’re useless, you’re worthless, that no one likes you or that you’ll mess everything up, it’s hard to just shut it out.

Rinse wash and repeat with any and every social situation. Yeah I’m getting better, I’m moving forward. I haven’t ended it, but frack man, it just takes one bad look, one simple “freak” or “weirdo” uttered under someone’s breath that sends me spiraling right back down to that dark place.

I was severely bullied through my late elementary school-early middle school years. Developed depression, anxiety, eating issues, and general body dysmorphia. All of these issues I still struggle with today. However, the most severe out of them is my anxiety. I worry over everything; no matter how big or small. The most insignificant thing can send me off in a fit of nerves and panic. I’m plagued with what ifs constantly. I’ve avoided social events because of anxiety. Most of my daily life is fucked up due to anxiety. My anxiety stems from the root of being afraid of messing up. As a kid, I taught myself to be a perfectionist; if I did everything perfectly I wouldn’t get in trouble. If I did everything right and was perfect inside and out, then my parents and friends and family wouldn’t have to worry about me. This has had a disastrous effect. I can’t go outside due to being so nervous of fucking up, doing something stupid, looking dumb, etc. I’ll get this knot in my stomach just thinking about going out with friends. I can’t talk to new/ somewhat familiar people because I get nervous that I’m not talking right or looking stupid or saying the wrong thing or just being overall disinteresting. Anything outside of my daily routine of work/school/home fucks me up. This also relates to new experiences. I’m scared of dating. I’m scared of sex. Whenever I think about these things I get this extreme burning sensation, a heavy fit of nerves, and I have to calm myself down because it gets so intense. I hate going on vacations because I get the what if’s and at the end of the day I just count down to the day I can be back in the safety of my own home. It’s killing me. I hate myself at the fact I can’t do regular things. I don’t have fun. My life is so mundane and basic that it frustrates me, but the anxiety and fear of the outside is what keeps me isolated. I can’t go places. I can’t talk to people. I can’t make new friends. I can’t live my life. I can’t take it anymore. It’s not even the fact that I won’t do it, I physically cannot do it. And it’s not like I can just shove myself out there. I’ve done that before and it’s just made everything worse. I’ve tried going out with a close friend and I hated it so much I just wanted to go home.

I've sought help from others online, from self help videos and books to personally researching mental illnesses and finding strategies to combat it, but nothing has helped. It continues to grow worse and worse. I've never been to a doctor, so I've never been diagnosed, but I suspect I probably have other kinds of mental illnesses as well as my anxiety, and I'm also having pretty bad health issues that are growing worse and worse.

I have some kind of skin inflammation issue that has been getting worse and spreading all over my body that started in my late teens. Sleeping issues. Joint pain issues. Memory issues. Issues focusing. Issues learning and enjoying things. Anger issues. Incapability of maintaining online friendships. Social issues. The list goes on and on. I'm just really sick. Both mentally and physically. Really, what I want to do is see a therapist. An online one. I've tried everything I can on my own, but maybe talking with a therapist online could help me with my anxiety at least to a point where I can get myself outside to go to a doctor and a therapist in person.

Having suffered from it since I was 15, I understand how debilitating it can be to just go outside and how the fear before just doing the simplest of tasks can make you feel. I am making this post because, although I know this subreddit tends to be mainly memes and jokes, and I love it for that, we do all share one common thing - we all suffer/do suffer from social anxiety. And for many, this post will be useless, but when I first subscribed to this subreddit, I’d never done anything significant to truly address and deal with my mental health. I had a feeling of hopelessness that I no longer have, and if I could go back in time and give these words to myself, I would. If this post can help just one person, then I’ll be happy! But right, in the last year, I met a girl. I struggle with going to University, but I need a future. She made me NEED to get better, and I wish I had the self control to make MYSELF force myself to take steps in getting better. I know for a fact there is someone reading this who hasn’t taken these steps to try and improve their social anxiety, because the social anxiety itself prevents people from doing so. Getting help involves speaking to say, a doctor, or a therapist, and this can be a massive, scary deal. So, with having social anxiety, it can be tremendously difficult to take the first steps to recovery. This is unique, in that suffering from a mental disorder such as OCD or depression doesn’t necessarily restrict you seeking help in the sense of being unable to get yourself, on your own, to see a doctor or a therapist. However, you have to want to get better. You have to know that you deserve better, that social anxiety is NOT normal, is NOT something anyone should suffer with, and that it IS a strongly researched mental health disorder which is legitimate and known by every health professional. You need to enforce this desire, and you have to make a doctors appointment. This will create a dialogue with your GP. You have to see what support is there for you. Your GP speaks to hundreds of people every week, with a whole host of different issues, both physical and mental. Mental health is a massive public health issue and is finally being treated as such. SEE. YOUR. DOCTOR! Doing this was the best thing I ever did, even though I was terrified when I had my first appointment. I am not ashamed to admit that I had some alcohol before going, thought about cancelling in the week leading up to the appointment and was just downright terrified of going. But I did, I said that I had anxiety, in social situations, and guess what - he understood. Doctors. Don’t. Judge. I was put on a small dose of medication - was a bit weird for the first few days, as it made me lose my appetite and feel a bit weird, but it settled. You don’t notice the affects of anxiety medication too much, it takes about 6 weeks for it to have any affect. It’s likely you’ll also have your dose increased after your body settles on it. It can feel like a long process, you just want to stop having these feelings of anxiety, of dread, of fear going somewhere and having the physical symptoms of your anxiety presenting themselves and embarrassing you. But it’s just the first step to getting better - medication CAN work. Some say it doesn’t work for them, but it definitely makes some difference for some, and I am living proof of that. Next - therapy. I wouldn’t have been able to do a single therapy session if it weren’t for medication. Some will be able to, and if you are, great. Secondly, money. I live in the UK, and here the NHS offer therapy for free if the patient needs it, so I’m lucky in that sense, although the waiting list was 3 months. I am aware that in many countries, therapy isn’t cheap. However, even where money is tight, please realise that your mental state is so important, and is ABSOLUTELY worth spending money on in looking to improve it. Social anxiety is not normal, and is not something you should have to be subject to every day. You deserve to get professional help. For those who literally cannot afford therapy, I sincerely apologise and ask you to see if there is anything you can do to get the help you need. Therapy is scary, at first. But it’s also the best thing I’ve forced myself to do. You become familiar and comfortable with a therapist. They understand social anxiety, they put you at ease and remind you that this is their JOB, and that they deal with patients with social anxiety EVERY SINGLE DAY. These are things you can do, that WILL make an improvement to your social anxiety. It will make your quality of life better, and it is absolutely worth doing. You only get one life on this earth, don’t live yours in the shackles of social anxiety because you deserve better.

Hi, I’m 13 male and i like to play street basketball with friends, play soccer and play basketball on my school team. So anyways i have something that is still really bothering me that happened 2 days ago. I was hanging out with my friend after school and his name is Dylan. We were wanting to get a street basketball game going so we called a bunch of guys and planned on playing in a hour. We had 8 guys interested. My brother was also interested and wanted to play so we said he could play. Then my mom said little later. I have a doctor appointment booked for you in 30 minutes and you have to go before you can play with your friends. She suggested all 4 of us (me, my bro, dylan) drive together to my doctor appointment and then she would drive us to the game. I said ok and quickly ran upstairs to my bedroom and put on my basketball jersey with shorts on. Then i said i’m ready to go. So we all drove to the doctors. Once we were there we didn’t have to wait long because it was booked already and the nurse comes to the waiting room and calls my name. I get up and saw my bro and dylan still sitting. I told them they could come too if they want. My mom then said are you sure because your your going to get a physical exam done. I didn’t know what that was and thought it meant was going to be showing how physical fast and strong i am. So they know im not weak for my age. So i told them yeah i don’t mind them coming in. So we got in the doctors room and we are waiting for 5 minutes and the doctor walks in. He says hi to me and my mom and then notices my friend and brother sitting in the room too. He then said are you sure you want your brother or friend in here when we do your physical exam? I said i don’t mind. Still not know what that really means. The doctor then said ok can you sit on the bed and take off your jersey? so checked my heartbeat and measured my waist. Then said ok can you remove your shorts. I was wondering why he was telling me to do this and was little embarrassed taking my shorts off in front of my brother and friend because both of them have never saw my in my underwear before or naked. Besides when i was 5 years old having a bath with my brother was the last time. So i take off my shorts and he told me to lay on the bed. So i did and pushing my tummy and using this triangle thing on my knee that makes my knee jump. He then told me he needs to check my bowels so told me to lay on my side facing away from everyone. He then lowers my underwear and my butt is now showing to everyone and i was so embarrassed! i could hear my bro and dylan giggling a bit. So then the doctor uncomfortably puts his finger in me and kinda hurt and then it was done and got me to stand up. I felt really embarrassed already and noticed my friend holding his phone and smiling. He had his phone down so i don’t know if he took a video or picture of me. Then the doctor said Can you please remove your underwear?! I was so nervous and felt anxiety coming in and looked at my bro and dylan who looked really excited. So i took off my underwear and covered myself and the doctor said put your hands on your sides. I could hear my bro and friend giggling but didn’t want to look at them. The doctor then checked everything including my frontal area for 5 minutes and also told me to turn around. Once everything was done and we left the doctors i felt so embarrassed! I didn’t want to talk to anyone. It was nobody’s fault but mine because my mom and the doctor both warned me and i didn’t know what a physical exam is. I can’t blame them. So my mom dropped us off at the basketball game but i really didn’t want to play cause i was having social anxiety and i sat off to the side. My bro and friend i noticed were talking to some guys and looked at me. I don’t know if they took a picture of me or video something but i felt embarrassed.

My social anxiety is very crippling, but I realize I need money to make my life better in the long run (i.e college funds, rent, etc). So here are some personal tips: nn1. Volunteer. Local pet shelters are great for this as they accept everyone who is willing and not a crazy psycho trying to skin cats. This will introduce you to the social environment of work, and if you volunteer at a pet shelter you will have animals to calm you during the stressful moments. Plus you can literally decide to go whenever you want. For me I go once a week for an hour or two and I even lead shifts now. It helps.nn2. Apply for quiet places. Like a fabrics store or garden center. Something very mello will help your anxiety. My first job was at Walmart in the produce section. The worst you\\'ll have to deal with is someone asking you where the oranges are while standing in front of them. You don\\'t have to work at McDonald\\'s boo, you can be a recluse and water plants for 6 hours a day.nn3. You have phone anxiety like me, so don\\'t pick up! Let them leave a voicemail. I got so many calls when applying for my first jobs and never once answered the first time. They would leave a voicemail and I would promptly call back within 2 hours to a day and give some believable excuse as to why I couldn\\'t answer such as I was in school, on the road, personal issue, bad cell service, etc. They\\'d always be happy to hear back and I would schedule interviews that way. Once you have an interview, save their number and wait for a call back and pick up if you can that time.nn4. Practice practice practice! Write down possible questions and answers to them. Go over them outloud. Take phone calls in a quiet or calm place. Practice common interview questions and prepare to be nervous.nn5. Set your hours low at first and work later or in the mornings. Go for about 18 to 20 a week and work from there. Do NOT, I REPEAT, DON\\'T set hours you\\'ll hate out of desperation that they will only want you if your availability is from 8am to 10pm Monday to Sunday. Also, pick late or early shifts. I.e pick shifts after people go to work for the day to before they get off (9am to 3pm) or after they are usually at home or asleep (9pm to early am for me personally). This is a great time to work at a store like Walmart, Target, etc. The most customers you\\'ll face are nurses or old women who are looking for plants in the meat asile. Get to know your city\\'s schedule and schedule yourself for times when the mass of people are typically busy or elsewhere. 24 hour stores are usually in need of people for these shifts.nn6. Finally, tell them you have anxiety. I have had two jobs, but have been offered over five and have applied to about 15 places. All of which, if I was interviewed, I explained my social anxiety. Employers nowadays are a bit more sensitive to this. You can say \"I have very bad social anxiety, and would prefer doing things mostly in the back or away from people until I am used to the work environment to prevent any problems from arising.\" They\\'ll usually say \"well we will train you to do x thing, but if it takes some time we\\'ll work with you.\" That\\'s when you know they\\'re interested. Don\\'t hide your anxiety to someone who can affect your future employability. My current boss and assistant manager both know how bad I suffer and often coddle me when they see it affecting my work performance. My fellow employees, though I am not friends with them, also understand this and will help me. I work in a pizza place and I take orders on register, give out food, and answer phones. When I need to step away I ask someone to take over and they will. Getting overwhelmed isn\\'t bad, just take a second to step back.nnSome other general tips to remember: Always apply for jobs you\\'ll like FIRST, wait a few days, and then apply for jobs you can deal with theoretically. Try to really go for jobs that match your interests as it\\'ll be easier to adjust to.nnIf you get denied, don\\'t freak. I did this before and it does nothing but take away all your hard work.

Ask yourself what your dream job would be. Then do research about what you should be doing to to get closer to having that job. If having a university education improves your chances of fulfilling your dreams, then go for university. Once you have figured whether you want to study or immediately start working, it's time to take the necessary steps to achieve your goal. Research universities you want to apply for, research employers you want to work for. Then rank them according to how attractive they seem, this will significantly reduce anxiety, as even if you don't get your first option you will likely have dozens of good alternatives on your list. You said your grades were good, so someone is very likely to accept you. nnThen try to figure out what each institution/workplace requires from you. Start writing your CV, your letter of motivation or whatever else they might need. You still have until summer before you graduate, and if you spend half an hour per day on these things the time will add up.nnRegarding your social anxiety there are many techniques you can use to reduce or remove it completely, but it does require some work. A good first step is always to ask yourself what gives you the most anxiety. Is it public speaking? Is it conversations? Based on your story it sounds like you have anxiety about meeting new people (a fear I know all too well). The best solution to this is, of course, to keep meeting new people. Find out about social activities you can do in your town or neighbourhood is there a sports-club, movie-club, hiking group, debating society? Another advice is to build a social anxiety ladder, where you will rank your anxieties from least to most anxiety provoking. Then work yourself up this list. Start by exposing yourself to situation that only makes your slightly anxious, once you feel that you can handle these more easily, start on the next item on the list.nnAlso, I need to add that just because you feel anxious around the people in your class doesn't mean that you will feel anxious around other people in the future. You said it was fine before you started gymnasium, so it is not unlikely that some anxiety are caused by the type of people you hang out with.

            "{'sequence': \"('My old friends planned a trip and didnt invite me on the same weekend as my birthday. I (23 years old) have some old college friends I still see about every week. For various reasons, a few of those friends, have grown closer to each other, and they are closer to each other than they are to me, although we still go out for drinks, bbq, have movie nights, and have fun every week, or every other week. Their social networks are also much broader than mine, because their careers all require extensive networking. I have also made different groups of friends since college, but not to the same degree as them. I know I feature less prominently in their lives than they do in mine at this point, and it’s not personal. We still have a good time, and just because things change doesn’t invalidate the friendship we do still enjoy. And when it comes to planning any kind of party, they are definitely my favorite friends to go out for a crazy night or a drink with. All of this is fine, until it comes to my birthday. My birthday falls on Labor Day weekend. Last year most of my college friends took advantage of Labor Day weekend to go on a trip to a cabin and have fun together. The person coordinating the event (whose parents own the cabin) obviously chose who would go (only a limited number of people were allowed to come with his parents’ permission). While this same person is a friend of mine, I was not a close enough friend to make the cut to be invited on the trip. Those invited on the trip, however, included most of my friends from college. This forced me to push my birthday party to a different weekend, as I still wanted my old college friends at my birthday party (I didn’t have as many other friends yet that year). But it really made me feel pathetic to plan my birthday around people who had decided I was not important enough to include on a trip the same weekend as my birthday. From what I understand, this same group is going on a trip this Labor Day weekend—once again on my birthday. Obviously a lot of people travel on the 3 day weekend, and I’m not a narcissist who expects no one to travel just cause it’s my birthday. I am also mature enough to not be overly offended if some of my friends plan trips without including me sometimes. But it really hurts me that my college friends all have a yearly tradition to go on a trip I’m not invited on every year the same weekend as my birthday. I know we all are going our separate ways, and I know I am making too much of a deal of my birthday, but birthdays are miserable reminders of life passing by for most people after a certain age, so I feel extra vulnerable around mine, and this is a bit of a punch to the gut for the past 2 years. I don’t want to be childish and tell them not to use the 3 day weekend (that would be dumb and selfish), I don’t want to force myself onto the trip (also dumb and childish), and I don’t want to cut out friendships over something that I don’t think is meant to be personal, when these friendships are mostly rewarding throughout the rest of the year. If someone could gently help me put this into perspective, or how to make me feel less in pain about this. However I celebrate on my birthday, I know I would feel the absence of those friends, and I don’t want to plan some elaborate trip in response—that’s just petty and wouldn’t actually help me stop being petty and hurt over this. I was also thinking about going on a backpacking trip alone so I can get some time to myself, because I don’t like how my relationships with other people are affecting my sense of self worth. That’s not how I want to live my life, and maybe I need to become more independent, and I am tired of having all this stress and pageantry around my birthday. I just know that I will likely be feeling bad because of this on my birthday (I know this is immature, and I need to work past this), and I’m afraid this will be in my thoughts no matter what I do.

            "{'sequence': \"('How I overcame Social Anxiety Disorder. This is my life story focused on how I struggled with SAD and what I did to overcome and cope with this horrible disorder. I hope that others that are suffering with Social Anxiety can not only relate, but can also see a path to success. It started in 4th or 5th grade or so and continued to get at its worst in 6th grade. In 6th grade, I would avoid social situations, I wouldn’t talk to most people around me and I was always known as the “quite kid”. I wouldn’t even talk to my own family.. I completely isolated myself from everyone except a couple of friends that I made in the previous years. But sometimes, I would isolate myself from them as well. I felt different, like everyone else was normal and I wasn’t. I did not understand how to talk to people, how to laugh, how to be around others without being judged. This was an all time low for me. So how did I go from an all time low in 6th grade to overcoming SAD? Well obviously this didn’t happen over night. Lets fast forward to freshman year in high school. At this point, I am not as bad as I was in 6th grade. I was able to make a few friends in middle school around 8th grade, but most of them did not go to my high school, only two of them. But despite having friends, I was still very quite. I kept to myself, constantly just on my phone. At lunch, I really didn’t have anybody to talk to most of the time. And every time somebody tried to talk to me, I just did not know how to communicate with them, I completely shutdown and I was just basically screaming in my head please just go away! So did I ever make any new friends? Not really. I avoided social situations, I kept to myself. Another reason why I did this, is because every time I got nervous taking to someone, my face would get really hot and I turn red very fast, this led me to avoid every single social interaction that I possibly could avoid because of the fear of blushing from how nervous I got. So that’s most of my struggles with this, I need to speed things up because this is turning into a book.. I got a job as a snowboard instructor (still freshman year in high school) and I had to teach groups of kids and sometimes adults how to snowboard. As someone who was very antisocial and a clear case of SAD, this was not easy. But while it was difficult at first, it actually wasn’t that hard. I didn’t need to make small talk with the kids, all I needed to do was to talk about snowboarding and show them how to do it. I had a step by step plan and I knew exactly what I was going to say. This was the first step for me to learn how to communicate with people like a normal human being. I did this for 4 years all through high school. This job helped significantly to force me to stop avoiding situations and to face my fear of social interactions and judgment The next step was college. The first class I took was a communications class, this forced me to speak in front of people every week. This class was proof that even though my speeches sucked, I could stand in front of people and not panic. I proved to my self that despite my SAD, I can do this. This class was truly the pinnacle of overcoming SAD. This class (Mindful Communication) tested how far I have come. I went from complete isolation from people and complete avoidance of all social situations, to standing in front of a college class of 25 people, which were all judging every word I said. I don’t think it’s this class that is what helped me so much.. but it was just the test to show that I can do this. What helped me so much was a combination of things. But I think the biggest help my was my experience as a snowboard instructor. It forced me to communicate with parents, kids, and other snowboard instructors. Putting yourself in the situation that you don’t want to be in is the best way to learn to cope with social anxiety. This is what worked for me, I’m not saying you all need to become snowboard instructors, but find something that will force you to communicate with people that you also enjoy doing. It’s not easy, but this is what it takes. So am I cured? No not completely. But I do not let social Anxiety run my life like it use to. I control my anxiety and I learned to cope with it. I do not avoid social situations like I use to, and I no not get super nervous when talking to people. I have a much better relationship with my family, and I now work as a software developer. I am 23 years old, and I have overcome SAD. I still have some social Anxiety, but it is not a disorder and it’s significantly improved. I hope my story is able to help somebody out there.

            "{'sequence': '(\\' Social Anxiety: The Essentials. After looking around, I felt that sharing my story may help others. And in some way make all the pointless suffering mean something if it helps or resonates with one person. Preface: I am a 24-year-old college grad whos spent countless years languishing in deep thought/fear/pain about their own behaviors and emotions. Probably have had more internal conversations than external ones. Crushed at times under the carousel of depression/self-loathing. Other times crippled so badly by fears of judgments that basic human tasks become sources of complete life-threatening terror. This becomes further compounded when those \"loved ones\" around you gladly and publicly point out your fears as if exposing you will somehow make you stronger. All of this and more! As I share my failures, my victories, and continuous battle with social anxiety. &amp;#x200B; The best way to tell this story is perhaps through pain points of the past, present,(and even future). So I will just dive in no particular order. &amp;#x200B; The Phone Who knew a modern wonder of tech that is supposed to connect us could also be the source of such bone-numbing fear. I think it all started back in 1st grade. A girl gave me her phone number (remember I am like 7). After school I called, and we engaged in the most 7-year-old conversation ever. So basically a conversation about nothing. Afterward, I found out that my Mom and Brother had picked up the downstairs phone and listened to the whole thing. They then for weeks afterward mocked me and repeated what I said on the phone. Talk about traumas to an undefined child. It\\'s events such as those that drive you to form opinions about yourself and make an early association with fear and speaking on the phone. Fast forward and think of all the times (starting from age 7) you have had to speak on the phone. Now imagine each time the thought of using a phone is so horrible it turns your stomach over. Social anxiety in a nutshell. I\\'ve found that with time receiving a phone call was the easier evil. Somehow it being unexpected and someone else initiating the conversation took the edge off it. Having lived into adulthood, phone calls are inevitable so you eventually (through exposure) adapt and develop a tolerance for them. Yet even so to this day placing a phone call to someone is still sometimes a shaky voice and sweaty palm event, particularly when its phone interview. I have one coming up in a few days and dread the idea of literally taking a phone call to be judged by someone. And don\\'t even get me started on making or taking a call in a quiet office space. Advice: Slowly Expose yourself (naturally through time or forcibly by need) to phone interactions. Next time you order food try calling instead of making your mom do it/using an app. Make a doctor\\'s appointment. Usually calling places that handle constant phone calls ( docs/food/customer service) are the easiest to make because you know what you need to say and the person usually is going off a script. It\\'s scary (trust me), but you can work up to it. I avoided using the phone until it became ridiculous for my age and just faced it through trial and error. &amp;#x200B; The Checkout Experience For the LONGEST time growing up this was another point of contact for me and my social anxiety. Having to go alone to a counter and ask/buy something. I really honed my avoidance maneuvers. Giving money to friends to buy my ticket. Walking together up to the counter with someone and throwing my order on theirs so at least I wasn\\'t alone doing it. Or just flat out avoided buying things or asking for help. It\\'s so ingrained in me that I walk into places today and am still so determined to figure out things for myself and not ask employees/help desks for information. Just the thought of having to do it/entering a situation where you know its coming would fill me with red hot anxiety. Like I could run away on the spot. This one really holds you back in life. Today I am more accustomed to it. I worked in retail behind the counter for 4-5 years through college. (that was it\\'s own personal hell). But I kinda reduced the fear a lot over time. I went to go buy a cable recently from an electronic store. I couldn\\'t find it anywhere. Eventually, I approached a worker and said \"Where are the ethernet cables\". He looked so confused and said \"WHAT?\". The worst thing to hear with as someone with anxiety. In a split second you feel nervous, ask yourself \"What did I say wrong? Is this guy going to yell at me?\" Turning inwards and feeling all insecurities explode out into your focus. I said again more loudly \"ETHERNET cables\", and he turned and showed me where they where. Little moments like this, I imagine other people don\\'t remember or acknowledge the way I do. The fact that something so small and unimportant stuck with me for me to be able to write about shows how impactful anxiety is on you. The fixation on past \"failures\" or \"awkward moments\". Yet logic tells me that It\\'s unlikely the worker in that story noticed or cared about my behavior and certainly did not judge me at that moment. If he did, why does it matter so much? These are the sometimes underlying thoughts one must grapple with. The emotions V.S rational thoughts. You feel things that are unpleasant caused by common situations and don\\'t understand/get angry with yourself over those feelings. Then you tell yourself what other people think doesn\\'t matter, then go back to feeling those emotions again. My advice: This one is more tricky because as long as your polite and to the point you can minimize how much you actually have to speak to someone behind the counter. And often if you come into a place prepared you don\\'t have to interact at all (Digital tickets/know where you\\'re going). If this is something you want to overcome, try ordering food in person at McDonald\\'s. (Probably where I first started practicing unknowingly). It\\'s simpler because your just reading from the menu and someone can stand near you if you need it. If you\\'re like me choose one that\\'s not so busy, sometimes the energy of a big crowd can overwhelm your senses. I think remembering the person your speaking to is usually trying to do their job or just answer your question or help you can ease the nerves. &amp;#x200B; The kids \"going through changes\" Not here to repeat any cliches about puberty. Just to note how much more difficult it is to adapt to changes when you\\'re socially anxious. My mom would always say \"you\\'re going through the CHANGE\". I grew leg hair early and it was a lot. It was something my mom especially would comment on. She/ other family would ALWAYS highlight imperfections or changes they noticed on my body. Leg hair, arm hair, acne, height, weight, posture. It\\'s hard enough braving middle school with asshole peers but your own fam making you feel inadequate through teasing is hard. I started just covering everything. Wore long pants all summer, stated avoiding the pool, or exposing too much. Essentially lived like a victorian woman in 1890\\'s. I was so uncomfortable with showing my legs or anything I felt was \"not normal\" I would rather sweat and boil in summer heat then show off my body. This lasted through to high school. Eventually with time It stopped being such a big deal to me. I can only describe it as one day, you wake up, and feel no emotions(or fewer emotions) triggered at the thought of doing the act. So then you just wear shorts. Or show off your body more. Today I am mainly uncomfortable about my weight. I still feel embarrassed about taking my shirt off. I rationally acknowledge that I don\\'t think I\\'m actually as overweight as I think I am and people probably don\\'t see me as fat as I see me. I CAN take my shirt off, but I avoid going to the beach or pools because I compare myself to other more fit people, and feel so unhappy with how I look. This may sound all cliche, but anxiety really takes these things and cranks the dial up to 11. It really impacts your ability to function and changes so much about how you act/what you do/where you go. Advice: This one I\\'m still working on. I think it\\'s an uphill battle (than can be won) if you change how you think. Maturity helps a lot. Getting older and leaving behind all those teenage ideals about judgments. And judging yourself less harshly. I think that\\'s a key to a lot of this. Remember that nobody externally can COME CLOSE to judging as nastily and self-degradingly as yourself. Other people don\\'t experience your day from begging to end. Only you live with all of your memories, behavior, experiences. And therefore the only thing in your control is to slowly change how you react and feel about them. I often say to myself \"be kind to yourself\". It sounds like something you see on a motivational poster in an elementary school hallway. But it\\'s truly worth working on. I think if you stop judging yourself and holding yourself to unrealistic standards of \"perfection\", you can start working on overcoming challenges and having small victories. I saw the path to overcoming anxiety as a straight line with total victory as the goal. But this is not a pass/fail experience! Every phone call, every conversation, I got a little better. You just gotta keep focusing on the victories. (This one sounded preachy but it\\'s my truth.) One thing I heard was this: Imagine your traveling along the same road each day. The road is full of potholes. You keep walking along and without fail always fall into the potholes. For years you keep traveling the same road and keep falling in the potholes. Eventually, your become a little more alert and move out of the way of one pothole. You avoided it. The next day you fall back into the same pothole. This cycle repeats. Yet over time there are changes. Sometimes you avoid potholes. The time it takes for you to pull yourself out of the potholes is shortened. (not doing the analogy justice but you get the point) I felt like this resonated with my life a little. It taught me that overcoming social anxiety is about the progress you make each day and not about achieving some goal of perfection or \"being more normal\". Take a moment and consider how different you are from 1 year ago, and then 5 years ago? I used to be so crippled by anxiety I basically couldn\\'t do anything. Yet somehow I graduated college, survived solo presentation and group projects, worked a retail job, then worked in an office. So if you really want to change, start small and don\\'t give up. The past few days I\\'ve been really anxious and depressed on and off. So it\\'s still something I carry with me. But I\\'m still here pushing and fighting.

            "{'sequence': \"(' I feel like my SA is ruining my life. Hi, I hope this is okay to post. I'm 17F, and I struggle majorly with Social Anxiety along with a mix of Aspergers, depression and extreme highs and lows. I am in desperate need of some advice from someone who doesn't know me. I was intending on posting this in the discord server I made and own for people struggling with mental health but ironically I couldn't get over the fear of people judging me for ranting in my own server (laughing in pain), so here I am. My current situation is that I am a year and two months into an art college course. I have eight months to go to get my diploma. Easy right? I've come this far, I can do the rest. Except, I can't. Every day that I'm there, I sit alone, trying to get my work done but for some reason I feel like absolute shit every second of every day spent there. I can't nearly begin to explain how it feels, the best I can describe it is as a physical heaviness on my chest, different from my normal anxiety. Even just thinking back to the feelings is enough to send me into panic. I mentioned at the beginning of this post that I deal with extreme highs and lows, and what I mean by this is that I have two bigger moods in my daily life, (high and low) and then I have normal mood me which for a while I didn't think existed but following therapy I have discovered that that middle mood is there. When I'm experiencing a high, it's almost as if I switch into a completely different person, like an extrovert. I start cracking jokes in front of people, I participate in all conversations, I feel confident and on top of the world, I feel restless and hyperactive. Having a high is completely random, there's no triggers that I've noticed. I also haven't noticed any triggers for my lows. When I'm low, I feel worthless; sad; emotional; silent; slow; unproductive and I get urges to either SH or kill myself. When I'm out of a low, it's hard to look back and remember in detail what happened, as if it's misted up in my brain like an old memory. When I was younger I was extremely depressed, and I SH and attempted suicide many times, so maybe this is a factor in the sudden urge to harm myself when I'm low as a reaction to negativity? I'm not sure. My 'normal mood' is me feeling calm with not much anxiety and no negative thinking, which to me feels like a happy mood compared to what I experience during a low. Back to my situation - when I'm at college and I experience these lows, there's nothing I can do to handle it, I can't just go to bed and sleep to escape it, or wrap up in a warm blanket and avoid all social interaction. I have to sit in a studio with thirty other people, feeling like that, and often times it leads to meltdowns or panic attacks. I have tried listening to music; fiddling with fidget toys; going for a walk outside; watching netflix; talking to lecturers about it; focusing on work; taking a break from my work and doing different art; drinking water; breathing exercises; sitting in the bathrooms; texting my partner; planning shopping lists. None of these coping mechanisms work. One thing I have noticed is that I either have a low, panic attacks or I get that physical sad heaviness on my chest that feels suffocating every single day at college, which I think has created a fear around attending the course due to having no escape from these emotions and feelings. I've only had a high at college about four or five times. I do remember a time at the beginning of the course where I didn't feel the suffocating heaviness, just the casual anxiety around people. I used to have friends on this course, we were a group of five but this year they've expanded the friendship group, which is all the people on the course. Socialising with four other people was enough for me to come home exhausted and needing to recharge, but I can't handle socialising with a group of 30 odd people. Since then, I've isolated myself from the group - not that the original group have really tried to involve me in the new group. Another thing to add is that I've never been able to maintain a friendship for longer than a year, my boyfriend of almost two years is the longest relationship of any sort I've had. Is this just me, or does anyone else have the same issue? I went on holiday with my boyfriend and parents for three days last week and my god, I felt free. I did feel anxiety and some strong emotions but they felt reasonable because I was in busy environments like a swimming pool or a restaurant. This was great news to me because I thought, hey, this is what life can be like. Then I came home. Hell broke loose within me. I couldn't get myself out of bed to go to college, I haven't been there in almost a week and my attendance is poor enough as it is. I can't work up the energy to shower. I don't feel hungry. I can't even get up to brush my teeth. I don't even want to do art, I've tried, it gives me too much time to think. I've tried sleeping it off, but then the next day comes too quickly and I have to rinse repeat. I'm having about four or five panic attacks a day and a night. I'm keeping my boyfriend awake because we're both scared that I will end up in a mindset where I can't take it anymore and I give up. I can't think about the future without melting down. It's mental and physical hell. I thought it was because of college that I feel this way, that I've had a taste of freedom and I've realised that college isn't it for me. But I'm not sure that's it. I was going to drop out, frustrated and disappointed in myself that I can't make it another eight months to get my art diploma but was confident that I'd be taking a step towards healing my mental health. Then came the bad news, my mum told me that if I drop out then I need to get a job to pay rent because she can't afford to keep me here if she doesn't get government benefits for me. My boyfriend (19M and a full time worker) lives with us, and we're currently sleeping in my parents front room in the side of the house. We've already been told that if we don't move out soon they'll kick us out. We've been looking for places to rent but nobody considers us because we're so young. This has only worsened my anxiety, and I know that I probably seem quite pathetic because I'm scared of working but it isn't just that, I've worked before and I got fired for having panic attacks. It isn't just an unreasonable fear anymore, it's my worst fear at a job come true. So, my choices are: 1. Drop out of college to save my mental health but be forced to find a job and pay rent which will only worsen my mental health anyway, leading me down a path of feeling suicidal for a period of time and then attempting suicide. I've been down that mental path before too many times and I don't want to die so this choice doesn't seem like a good one for me. 2. Continue college for the last eight months, continue feeling this mental hell that I so badly wanted to escape. Get my diploma, be forced to get a job when the course ends anyway. Go back down on the same path of mental health and feeling suicidal. Again, I don't want to die. This is where I'm stuck. Both paths worsen my mental health which I don't want. And I appreciate that not many people enjoy school or working, but to me this isn't just about lack of enjoyment, it's as if there is something in my body that physically stops me from doing it. You know when you have two magnets that are facing the wrong way so you physically cannot connect the two? There's always that distance as you try your best to grip them in your hands and force them together. That's what I experience in my chest, and it's not just an emotion, it's as if there is actually a magnet in my chest. Like, no matter how hard I try to just push through and do these things like jobs or courses, there's a force that won't let me. Believe me, I'm frustrated at myself too for being such a failure. And to address the paths of feeling suicidal, I'm not talking about it like that to be dramatic, I mean it in a way that it's my life pattern and I can't fix it, no matter what I try. My mental health deteriorates, I keep going through it and try my best to get through to the light at the end of the tunnel, but it gets too much, too many lows, too many bad thoughts, too much for me to take. I either take myself to hospital, or I attempt suicide. And it's easy to just say well why don't you push harder, try for longer. I've tried, either way I end up in the hospital waiting room. I've attempted three times this year, the last was this Summer, where I was in the waiting room with my boyfriend from 9:45pm until 11am the next day after being promised a bed on a ward. I was discharged within an hour of being seen. Having been so many times with no help or answers as to why I'm like this, going to hospital isn't an option anymore because obviously there's nothing they can do for me. It hurts so bad that there's nothing I can do to make this better or to make this go away, I don't want to die and leave all my pain to my boyfriend, but I want to not exist anymore, it seems like the only option I have that isn't months and months of torture followed by attempting suicide as a result of it all anyway. My boyfriend is an angel, he didn't sign up for this when he met me and I feel like such a burden on him, but he insists that he'll always be there for me and he compares it to when I was his rock when he was depressed and anxious but he was strong enough to not give up, unlike me. Is this just bad social anxiety? Or is there something wrong with me? Does anyone else feel like this? I hope this made some sort of sense to somebody out there. TLDR; I have two options of continuing college or getting a job, but both feel physically impossible due to anxiety and bad mental health. I fear both paths will lead to me killing myself.
