However, I have not dominated the whole 'initiating' conversations aspect. usually the places where I am able to talk, the act of talking/chatting is sort of \"set up\", like in a club or some sort of social gathering. However this is usually where you will talk with someone anyways. You probably won't chat with some person walking opposite you at the mall or on the street.nnWhat I believe you and I should do (or maybe just me), theoretically, and what makes the most logical sense, is to just put ourselves out there and fail. get up, fall down again, get up again. Like anything, social skills take practice to gain. You can't get practice without experience and you can't gain a skill without both.nIt sucks, and it will hurt (if you are me), but it gets better. nnI think you overthink the way I do, which is that we try and make sure to think really well about what we want to say so that the conversation is perfect and there are no random pauses or awkward silences. Or, maybe that's totally not what your problem is. I know for me, I focus too much and actually DO very little.nnI'm sorry that I didn't give real clear cut advice but I hope you will from others.

I'd be awkwardly swimming, worrying about what the others think of me (even if I don't think anything about other people swimming and I know they don't think anything of me, I know it but I still can't proceed like a fucking normal human being), not to mention I hate my skinny body thanks to nearly every fucking person in my life mocking me for it.. In the end, even if I did reach the swimming pool, I'm sure I'll get out after 30 min and just walk home crying.. I want to wake up early, take the bus for the capital, go through the shops even if I don't have a lot to spend, maybe buy a cute thing or eat a burger, or just walk in the streets and laugh.. And then I get even more scared of the outside world for the next time I have to go outside.. I want to go to the swimming pool and swim all day.. On the bright side, I have an amazing boyfriend who's very supportive and knows how it feels, so maybe when we move in together in a few weeks, I'll be able to go swimming with him.. I'd like to think that if I manage to step outside and start walking there, everything would go fine by itself then; but even if I did get through it and reach the swimming pool, I'd be too worried about the people around me to enjoy being there.\n",
