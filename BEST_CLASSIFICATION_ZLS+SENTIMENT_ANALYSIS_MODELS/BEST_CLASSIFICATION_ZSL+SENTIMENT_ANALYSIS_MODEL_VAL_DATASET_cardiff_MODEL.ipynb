However this is usually where you will talk with someone anyways. You probably won't chat with some person walking opposite you at the mall or on the street.nnWhat I believe you and I should do (or maybe just me), theoretically, and what makes the most logical sense, is to just put ourselves out there and fail. get up, fall down again, get up again. Like anything, social skills take practice to gain. You can't get practice without experience and you can't gain a skill without both.nIt sucks, and it will hurt (if you are me), but it gets better. nnI think you overthink the way I do, which is that we try and make sure to think really well about what we want to say so that the conversation is perfect and there are no random pauses or awkward silences. Or, maybe that's totally not what your problem is. I know for me, I focus too much and actually DO very little.nnI'm sorry that I didn't give real clear cut advice but I hope you will from others.

But it feels like there is this motor running in me, like if I don't let my friends know my each and every thought that they will forget about me or I will fall apart.. It'll be like Friday night drinks and dancing, Saturday brunch, park hangout, and then party at night, Sunday brunch and shopping with another friend and hopefully leaving the night open to deal with the Sunday Scaries.. They'll bring up the amount of people I wave to on the street while I'm with them, but what they don't understand is that while I have those people to wave to, those friendships are shallow and limited to just waving at each other or exchanging smalltalk whenever we run into each other.. I wouldn't enjoy getting drunk as much anymore, and found myself spending more time alone smoking weed and making art.\n",
