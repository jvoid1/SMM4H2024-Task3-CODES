In terms of talking to him in person, you don't necessarily have to give off the perfect impression every time you are with him. If he is a genuine guy, he won't judge you for appearing a little shy or vulnerable. But at any rate, my advice to you is to do whatever it is that calms you down (listen to music, take a short walk, etc.) and just go for it. Whether he responds positively to you or not, you will never know unless you try. Also, don't try and force yourself to act any differently and be true to yourself. This is all pretty cliche, but it really is the truth haha, and the older I get, the more I realize it. But yeah, just be yourself and give it a shot, you won't get a second chance if you don't do it now so go for it! I hope I was able to help a little and good luck!! \", \" I'm gonna do the Pokemon thing to get myself to go outside more, do bike and such. Maybe it'll help with my SA :) As for books, the Millenium (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, ...) trilogy is amazing, and my favorite book is the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The movies were good for all of these, but the books are worth the read even if you watched the films. Specially HGttG. \", ' Something that work for me is to expose myself to my anxiety. Even though I\\'m starting to become anxious, I keep doing it. The trick is to not go over a threshold. If I\\'m too anxious, it affect how I act and then everything goes bad (not that bad but my anxiety amplify everything that goes bad and then I keep thinking about it and it just worse). Taking a walk is a great way, you can start in a residential place with less people and then move on to place with more and more. Going to movie theaters, fast-food, restaurants, conventions, also helped me. All situations where I had just a little anxiety but that let me see how people acts and let me understands them a little better. Another thing that you need to do, is stopping to be negative about yourself. You don\\'t seems to be that negative, though you do say \"anyone who bothers to read this\" which seems like it\\'s negative reading your thread (it doesn\\'t bother us, we are there to read theses threads, like any other one), but it\\'s important that you are aware that you should avoid negative though. Often we justify being negative by saying that this way you are aware of your flaw, which is better than not. Sadly often we are wrong, theses negatives though aren\\'t that important and they are amazing to lose any motivation to improve. Instead, you need to find the positive in the situation and if really there\\'s something negative important, don\\'t see it as negative but as something to improve.  at this point i have no assurances and putting my faith in a psychologist only to go thru months and years of no improvement would probably destroy me. It doesn\\'t destroy you right now? Really how trying anything is worst than not trying anything and staying the mess you are right now? Believe me, you can\\'t be worst than you are right now, you can fail, and you may fail often, but that will just bring you back to where you are right now. Anxiety is a bitch though and it will always try to give you the impression you don\\'t improve and are just worst than you ever was by simply trying. You need to stay positive. Therapist know what you live, they know plenty of ways of dealing with it, they are the professional, they know what they are doing. I never saw one because I\\'m sure I can fix that by myself, I hate depending on someone, but I have no doubt that I would be able to do it much quicker than currently with their help. I already convinced myself to go see one if I no longer see improvement. ', \"Absolutely! Please encourage your son to do so. No, make your son exercise. Having suffered from SA for a long time, I decided to go to the gym and it has completely turned my life around. I may still have SA, but I am on the right way to overcome it. Your son doesn't necessarily need to go to the gym in particular, he could just go for a 15 minutes run in the morning or try a sport. Please read up more on the benefits of exercise on body-image, self esteem, endorphins and more. You really need to talk to him about this since it will turn his life around. Otherwise, he is likely to live a shitty teenage life. Good luck. BTW: Some members may disagree with what I say. Don't listen to them if they do: they don't have a clue about what they are talking about.\", \"I so agree its such a feel good thing for me. I use to go running at this track in the field of a school early in the morning like 6:30. But now that school has started, not only can't I run there but theres like the fear of morning hustle  and bustle of parents dropping off kids no matter where I run. Running in the daytime is just the worst so many people. Also to make it worse I run really fast which I feel draws a lot of attention to me.  and this is weird but its almost hard for me to slow down, I feel like I'm galloping like a horse or something. I even walk way faster then normal.\", ' no need to go gym that makes me nervous walking your dog will work, long walks calm me down also ', \" Yeah that's why I was more so asking if anybody didn't feel that way. I know most of the earths population doesn't like the cold. I live in Texas but have always dreamt of living in London. I love love love the gloomy weather there. I love it also when its extremely cold. There's something about a warm car ride through the cold night. Its funny I think with the nose thing I actually get the opposite. My nasal tracked gets super dry to the point it's very painful to even breath. But I'll just carry saline around in my pocket. Also it never really lets up for me either. Its like how I've noticed people in the SA community often say how they play video games all day. Sure they might do that to occupy their time, but it doesn't change the fact that they're extremely socially anxious  and depressed. That might be the thing for them. But personally the only thing I have is music,  and the desperation for winter. The winter means a lot of quite time, sitting outside, or going on long walks because I don't have to be as anxious. There are much less people out  and about when its cold. So just more time to myself... \", \"You and me, we're at the same place. 23 years, barely any real life experience, sick of studying to work when we can't even find ways to enjoy free time outside of it; we fucking need to do something completely different. I have been contemplating ever since the last semester started of dropping out and then doing something drastic that's totally outside of what I have done before. I grow too apathetic and careless in this state. I should travel or something and get to see life more so I don't feel so detached. I thought moving out would be the start of me forcing myself to having to go out more, but it's the opposite. I have the extra stress of having to take care of myself, but now I can fully isolate and not seek out people every day and I don't have parents or siblings that get guests or even people I get to talk to. Last weekend I spoke to nobody for 2 days straight, and now I'm derealized again. I'm also depressed again and it makes me work slow, and get behind in my studies and I don't even like playing video games anymore because everything bores me to death. I'm sure it's just another episode of us being depressed OP and then perhaps in a week we'll have a couple of good days again. I used to jog once a week in the summer leading up to semester start, but it's getting colder outside and I'm more exhausted and don't get as many things done. But I think we really need something to revitalize us. Also, I envy you for actually having a place with girls. I study in a small town because it's the only place in my country with the special education found there, but there's only like 5 girls there. Normally I don't have a chance at flirting to begin with because I'm so awkward and anxious but now there's not even any girls that stick out that I can daydream about _ It sucks and I'm just tired as shit of living here. Anyway, we're practically venting the both of us, but hang in there and make the best of tomorrow. Let the depression run its course until you're reminded of something positive you can do. Peace ;)\", 'It\\'s true for me. I realized it more and more into my university life, especially as classes became more demanding and I had to rely on other people. 70% of my classes have been team-based, and I mean compulsory team projects/presentations which means that I can\\'t just study my ass off alone in my house anymore. Trying to be part of a team is constantly putting stress on me. Presentations are a nightmare. I struggled during my internship because of my bad social skills, but I managed. I study computer engineering and I thought I could be a genius programmer and code all day every day. But no, no matter what your job is, social skills are a must. I\\'m not saying this to scare you, but it\\'s what I\\'ve learned. Even in the college world, I see many people who pass because they hang out with the best students, they share the best notes, get familiar with professors, etc. And I don\\'t accomplish as much with sheer work and dedication. During this time I have managed through difficult situations, I have somehow improved my social skills, but I still struggle every single day. If I were you, I would start by trying to connect with fellow students. It\\'s not about having friends, it\\'s about securing your \"network\" in case you need to work with others in the future. Try to find some people that you see often and maybe sit next to them in class. You can do some small talk by asking them if they know how X thing is solved or something. I believe that going out of the house is beneficial even if you don\\'t have a purpose. Just go on a walk to relax. There are periods when I get stuck at home for many days in a row and my SA deteriorates significantly. Don\\'t isolate yourself, just try to push yourself little by little. Also, there\\'s no need to ever compare yourself with others. You do what\\'s best for you and let others do their thing.', \" Same here. I feel really awkward eating around people at my college so I always go to a park that's not exactly that close. \", \" Yes, whatever kind of exercise you do, it's just so great for you. Being outside is an extra plus!! Keep going :) \", ' successful social interactions like that are seriously like a drug. Today I was all down about my SA. Then I went on a hike and met a couple of really cool people on the mountain. Now I feel great! ', \" Porn causes social anxiety and depression. You should join the NoFap community here on Reddit. It's really good with a lot of good insight and encouragement. A lot of people on there are having the same problems you are.

When it comes to these things, the best next course of action is to organize yourself. Lay out your plan of action. Think about what your next step should be after you have dealt with the obvious emotional baggage that is created following a breakup from such a longterm relationship. Another thing: before you let someone love you, you need to love yourself. It seems to me that you relied on him too much (I hope this does not sound harsh; totally not my intention), and now don\\'t know what to do. Remember that relationships are not a MUST. Don\\'t feel like you need someone, or need to be with someone. Instead, for now try to work on your emotional state and stability. Join a yoga class, start running, anything to let out some of the pent up anxiety and frustration. Painting is a beautiful way (I find) to express your emotions.

It is a cry in the night, a strangled laugh.\" -George Rouault \"Every artist dips his brush in his own soul, and paints his own nature into his pictures.\"-Henry Ward Beecher Although I have personally never dealt with a breakup (never been in a relationship either), my friend has recently broken up with her boyfriend of 8 years (also in her 30s). It\\'s terrible because you both believed you had everything set for the rest of your lives, and then this happens. The immediate reaction is to cry and feel like your world is falling apart.

Maybe ill start going for runs to alleviate stress. Im not sure if it'll work but ill try. Thanks! \", 'Hey man! I\\'ve been at that point. Didn\\'t have real man tits, but like ~30kg to much (I\\'m a 1.85cm guy). And I was really uncomfortable with it. Struggled with that for years, it made me unattractive and other things, but I was more afraid of working out in a gym and people seeing how fat i was and how I wouldn\\'t perform the exercises right then of living with it. So I did nothing. Then during my last year of school due to the lack of any social life and stuff I decided I had to do at least something meaningful in my life (playing games, programming and watching minute physics all day didn\\'t satisfy anymore, it didn\\'t serve any purpose). Then I started running, every day in the evening though the fields, where no one could see and bother me. I think I started with 1km, really slow, and I truly hate running. And i was really bad at it. But at least at the end of the Day I had the feeling that I\\'d done at least one thing that served a purpose on that day. I got better at it, started running longer rounds and faster, I used one of these running tracking apps, they motivate A LOT! Even started to enjoy it sometimes a bit. At the same time I started running I cut back my food intake (in retrospective I ate way too less then I should have). Both these things where just hard on a physical level - I was a) hungry and b) running is hard work. BUT you\\'re not working against your fears in that case, so it\\'s doable! Fast forward some months later, I was still going on a run every day, and I partially hated it. But I got better, I lost weight, and for the first time in my life I ran 5km. Thinking \"wow, I\\'ve never archived that in my life before\" was a very good, receiving and rewarding thought. Same for 6,7,8,9 and 10km. Almost a year later, I was down 30kg at my target. Still had all my other anxieties and shit, but my weight wasn\\'t one anymore. Since I started college after that I thought \"why not join a gym, I want to build up muscles\" and from there on I went at least 3 times / day, and I love it! Since my weight wasn\\'t an issue before and I had a good friend of mine with me who showed me everything anxiety wasn\\'t an issue there, the only thing needed was work. And it was sure rewarding, I looked better. Now, 2 years later, I\\'m comfortable with the way I look - still have most of my other issues, only started working on them recently, but seriously, weight and muscles are the easiest issues to fix (that doesn\\'t make it easy, I know, I\\'ve been there!). **I truly believe you can do that too**! Sorry for the wall of text, thought since I\\'ve been though a similar thing thing that might help.', ' Exercise do jumping jacks, push-ups, go for a jog. It temporarily burns the anxiety for a bit.

And then you have an excuse not to take the ride, since you don't want to leave your bike at work!\", ' Grounding and breathing techniques work for some. Some people prefer listening to music, taking a walk or a bath, etc. Doing an activity that you enjoy can sometimes take your mind of your worries, but I personally understand that thoughts can get overwhelming no matter what you\\'re doing. Working bit by bit to relax will help you master the ability... in my experience as an \"anxious person,\" I couldn\\'t just \"get relaxed\" immediately. It\\'s taking time to find out what works by trying a few things. Maybe make a list of what you like to do or Google relaxation techniques and try some, note the way it makes you feel, and try to implement some techniques in your daily schedule. ', ' Hate to tell you what you already know, but trial and error is the best way. Exposure therapy. Something that I first did when I started to try and improve my SA was to go to my local park and just go for walks. I made it a point to smile and nod to everyone I passed, and eventually gave a verbal \"hi there\" or \"hey.\" I won\\'t forget how hard that was at the time, and how far I\\'ve come *because* of those days. So bars and clubs don\\'t really vibe with you, they aren\\'t my thing either unless someone invites me, but there are other outlets! If you have a local card shop or board game shop I would bet they have weekly gatherings and play MTG or Monopoly (these kinds of places tend to attract a crowd of people with SA and as I\\'m sure you can guess they are very welcoming people.) I also spend a lot of time with my sisters, I can honestly call them my best friends! They have helped me tremendously with my SA, I\\'ve got a long ways to go, like yourself I\\'ve never been in a relationship. I try not to let that get me down though, it\\'s a daily struggle but I try hard to have a positive outlook, and I\\'m very proud of that. I would say your best bet to developing friendships is to find them within your work. It\\'s tough I know, god do I know, but more often than not if you\\'re kind to people and have a genuine interest in what they say and who they are you will naturally fall into a routine with them, who knows, maybe they will invite you out somewhere! ', ' There\\'s a quote that I heard a few years ago that has stuck with me, I can\\'t remember who I\\'m quoting; \"Those who travel fastest travel alone, those who travel farthest travel together.\" Very powerful when I first hear this, I too live with a roommate who constantly has his girl over and often has friends. I\\'m friendly enough but they aren\\'t really a part of my life so I tend to avoid them. You say you have more pressing issues, are they issues that can be solved by curling up in your room? I\\'m going to guess not, everyone with SA has issues they need to work on, finding out how to solve them in a way that suits you best is what is hard as hell. For me it began with just walking my local park and saying \"hi\" to everyone I passed. I was alone but not lonely, that\\'s what so tough about having SA and being introverted. I understand your pain, and it can be very embarrassing to isolate yourself when surrounded by a ton of people, as well as very, *very* distracting for yourself. I think a great option would be to possibly look for someone else, or to spend less time at home and more time working on your issues. Self discipline is incredibly helpful with SA. ', 'I hear ya man.. I turn almost 21 this year and have social anxiety pretty badly. I can say it is not as severe as having to drop out of school but it was pretty close to it. A few things I can tell you: 1) Mindfulness. Something I SHOULD practice more of.. but mindfulness is a form of meditation to help bring your mind out of the constant state of thinking (i.e. about if others are judging me) and brings you to a complete focused state. Look up mindfulness audio sessions or something like that on google, there is plenty of tutorials and things to help. 2) \"Don\\'t break the chain\" ..its something the famous comedian Jerry Sienfeld talked about. This is a comedian who has done so many stand up routines that it seemed so unlikely he was able to write that many jokes! How does he do so many one hour specials?! He mentioned it was something he calls \"dont break the chain,\" or in other words he would write a joke every single day, good or not, but do so EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. The reason I say this is because you should find something to work on every single day, no matter what! I myself joined a gym about a year and a half ago.. it was not because I wanted to lose weight (though that was on my mind as well) but because I needed some constant factor in my life that I would put forth effort each day to complete, something I HAD to do, to keep my mind on it.. You should find something to do, even if it\\'s just drawing a small picture or running a mile.. do it EVERY DAY! And if for whatever reason you can\\'t.. just do it the next day! In all of my years in dealing with social anxiety (and a negative family putting me down) I realize that the anxiety stems mostly from overthinking. Is that person looking at me from their car as I walk down the street? Am I worthless because I don\\'t have a job? Is what I\\'m wearing okay? etc. the list is endless. For me, social anxiety has stopped me from my potential being fully realized. It has stopped me from having a healthy relationship with pretty much any woman. It has stopped me from going out on the few beautiful days I see here.. I still have it, but not as bad. I practice a few things every day and you eventually reach a point of self confidence. You will know when you start to get comfortable with yourself and you start having thoughts like \"who gives a shit what they think! This is what I\\'M doing for me!\" One last note: I currently live in an area where cannabis is legal for recreational use. I started smoking not for my social anxiety itself but the fact that many other people here seemed to do it. I started smoking to make friends but now I keep smoking because it does make me feel good and content with the world around me. Not saying you should smoke pot but it is something that has helped me very greatly. Hopefully I was of some help, either way the best of luck to you!', 'Try running outside. Today was my first day: bought cheap running gear. It was cold and rainy but after I ran for 30 minutes I returned home and I was so sweaty, that I took a lukewarm shower. And now I feel great.', \" Yeah, totally. My neighbors don't like me because sometimes I smoke outside near the apartment. I know I shouldn't but anyway they barely look at me. I feel insecure about it and tend to look away as well. One time I woke up and went outside for a walk. I was sober which I rarely am and it made me feel more confident. Looked my neighbour in the eyes as I passed by him and was still pretty relaxed. He greeted me instead of ignoring me. I'd say it truly makes a difference for me. \", \"Maybe try to find a hobby? I bought a second hand 3D printer and have loads of things to do with it. Picking up metal detecting got me to go out in the nature at least once a week. Exposure to sunlight increases serotonine levels. Hobbies can fill a part of the void pretty well. It's not a perfect substitute by any means, but I found it helped break the weed-TV-depression habit. I'm still really lonely and failling at life, but my hobbies offer me a glimpse of hope. I still enjoy the things you've listed from time to time, but it's not an addiction imo  and I try to avoid spending too much time that way.\", \" Do the same I do now - take a nice walk in the remote nature or go metal detecting.

Now I'm not saying to go to a party on the spot, just go out, shop, take a walk in the park, that kind of thing. The best way I trained myself to socialize more was going out and shopping. I had to talk to the person at the counter, and it helped boost my skills. Once you've done that for a while, try hanging out with your friends. Doesn't have to be much, could even be a movie. The way I've met most of my friends has been through mutual friends. You're kind of forced to meet and talk to each other, and it can grow into something good. And hey, if you get invited to a party, go. Hang out with the people you know, and eventually you'll talk to other people. Basically start small and build your way up. I'm not great at socializing myself, but this has helped. And yeah, being depressed really weakens the drive, but you gotta make yourself. I find that once I am socializing, I have a blast. \", \" One thing that really helped me just get outside and around people was going on walks/running around a trail. It was terrifying the first few times but then I realized that no one really cared that I was there. It's an easier (and understandably challenging) thing to start doing if you're uncomfortable being around people even when there's no need to talk. (I tend to get anxious whenever people can see me.) I enjoyed trails with a lot of turns so I wasn't constantly in sight of people. But once I got used to it (I had to force myself a few times) I went to different trails that had a more straight path for a change of scenery. It's something I've done for about a year and a half now that I really enjoy doing multiple times a week. Sorry for any errors, I don't really comment things. \", \" Totally worth it man, not even a question. It's hard to tell you what to do, but what I will say is to **Definitely don't** think about it. It's quite a challenge but the reward of being being totally cool and calm when you're there outweighs the effort of the next few weeks. Here's the part where I mention all the things you could be doing to ease your mind: read, go outside, exercise, and we've all heard this spiel and know how great they all are...but they are great, in fact probably the greatest things you can do during these next two weeks. And why not really? Reading will occupy your mind while keeping you focused even entertained, and going for a bike ride on a nice day feels so good in the sun. Trust me man, change your life for a bit, see what it's like to be where you want to be.

I know its cliché, but there is medical evidence that supports this claim. I know I feel \"normal\" when I run. I was recently stricken with anxiety and it destroyed my life. I realized the first thing I had to do was get my life back to 0. I quit everything that I considered negative in my life: My shitty job, shitty friends, shitty habits. I literally did a hard reset on life and it put me back... like way fucking back. Live the life you see yourself living, not the one society wants you to live too. Im 25 and haven\\'t had sex/a girlfriend in like 6+ years. My family always gives me shit for this, but fuck em. Its my life and I find happiness from myself, not other people/sex. Last little thing, make sure your healthy. Like there is nothing wrong with you medically, sometimes it might be something small holding you back and you didn\\'t even realize it. Like a weird food allergy or lack of REM sleep. Turns out the cause of my anxiety was enlarged adenoids. Just had them removed and now im relearning how to talk to people as silly as that sounds. Anyways, you got this man. Smalls goals, one day at a time will eventually lead you to a big goal down the road. Good luck dude! PS: I know I didn\\'t really answer your question, but to answer it: How do I look forward to things? I really only look forward to things that make me feel good, which are far and few between now. One of those things being running. My definition of a happy life? Doing whatever the fuck I wanna do. Fuck getting married or dealing with some nagging bitch all day. I wanna work as hard as I can and retire early so can travel and see the world. But that me, What do you want? Minus societal influence, that is your definition of happiness. Go get it. (Sorry for the rant, but your post kinda reminded me of myself. Literally the day I went running, I was laying on the floor in a pile of my own misery and I just yelled at myself until I got my shoes on , headphones in, and fucking went for it. Yes I felt like shit and got shin splints, but fuck it was worth it!) Good luck man, you got this!', 'I wouldn\\'s say I\\'ve overcome it completely yet but I do feel much better now compared to how I was a year ago where I barely left my house all by myself. I like to think of these things like challenges/experiments. For example, if you\\'re afraid of walking around the streets by yourself, start off by walking around the neighbourhood where you still feel slightly anxious, but a lot safer, and continue doing that until you feel like there\\'s no threat anymore then go for bigger things, if you\\'ve got phone anxiety then dial strangers on purpose and act stupid then say you\\'ve got the wrong number and hang up. If wanna talk freely to a group of around 6 people for example, try expressing yourself when there\\'s only 2 people for example. You know, baby steps. I also tried to neutralize my anxious thoughts. If an anxious thought would suddenly occur about an upcoming event, I would try to calm myself down and say something like \"Maybe, it won\\'t be as bad as I think, maybe I\\'ll do better this time, it can\\'t be that bad.\", \"I\\'ve done this before and I know I\\'ll do it again, I certainly won\\'t die!\" Mantras such as \"I am completely independent of the good and bad opinions of the others\" in my opinion also help. \"Haters gonna hate\", \"I can only be myself, and if someone doesn\\'t like me for it, then it\\'s their problem, not mine\". \"I am just as important as anyone else is.\", etc.. Sometimes if I fail and end up being awkward or anxious I just try to pick myself up, dust myself off and congratulate myself for at least trying, telling myself that maybe next time I\\'ll do better because I know that as long as I keep trying and moving on, and some day when that last restriction of my life melts away, I will finally reach my goal where I\\'ll be happy, anxiety free and live the life I\\'ve always wanted. P.S. I also meditate daily to keep a clear mind. I personally think it helps us to reinforce the positive statements I mentioned above more easily into our minds. Apologies for the crappy English.', ' It\\'s okay, at least you know that your perception of love is not realistic. Loneliness will never really go away despite getting a significant other unless you get to a point where you are content with yourself. At the very least, reduce your drinking. Smoke less. Drink more water, and go for jogs/walks more often. If you keep this up it will be substantially beneficial. Man, the only way you can fully get on the path towards progress is to forgive yourself, be self-compassionate. It\\'s alright to make mistakes, as long as we use them as stepping stones. Continue writing, you don\\'t have to be Nabakov or Charles Dickens to start. Let yourself take baby steps instead of expecting full recovery of yourself in an instant. One thing I kind of did with social anxiety and depression was go, \"Fuck it. Why do I care about this? Why do I overthink? The world will eventually end and nothing will matter. None of these people are anything in the grand scheme of things. I am nothing as well. Thus I have nothing to lose, and I\\'m free to just do whatever I want without this fear. I have the right to. In this short life I\\'m just going to live the best I can. I deserve that.\" No time is really wasted. It\\'s all how you look at things. ', \" I understand the anger, but at the same time, this isn't a chill way to express the way you feel. Take a walk dude. Take a walk. \", \"Only liking 35-40% of the girls probably means you are more picky on appearance than you realize. It also means you already set a value on attractiveness that you think you deserve and feel entitled to. This is bad because you're missing out on meeting the other 65% of the women on tinder. If you haven't matched already, it probably means you are going for women that are out of your league appearance wise based on tinder profile pics. This could either mean you aren't as good looking as you think you are, or you are not putting very flattering pictures of yourself on tinder. I'm going to guess it's the second one. If you don't have an awesome body to show off I would avoid taking mirror pics or selfies at your house. I would avoid selfie pictures entirely unless you have a unique background that says a story about you and is flattering to your face. Go find a hike with an awesome view and have someone snap a picture of you. Or go to a popular/trendy spot in town and get a picture taken. Or take a funny absurd picture in front of a tv that has you interacting with one of the characters. Hope this helps man. With social anxiety you have to unlearn a lot of the effects of having it and be open to being silly in public and work really hard to get rid of the entitlement complex. Because to you, you're trying so hard to put yourself out there, but to anyone else it's just a regular day if that makes sense. That's how I think I developed the nice guys complex at least. It took a lot of effort to put myself out there and because of that I think I deserved more just because I had to really try and over come my SA. I felt like if I did ask someone out that they were assholes if they said no because I put so much effort into it. I failed to see women as people, only as goals. And trying so hard to not reach your goal sucks. This was a really fucked up way of thinking that took a long time to unlearn for me. Most people you meet won't even know you have social anxiety unless you tell them. And if you do they probably haven't a clue what that means other than you hate crowds.\", \" I did counseling for my SAD and depression, and one of the best tips my counselor gave me was to take baby steps. My anxiety is so severe that I have trouble going outside alone, and I shake and have trouble breathing when meeting new people. We started off with me walking down the street and looking people in the eye, and then she had me go to the receptionist and ask for the time. It's definitely the tiny steps that make a major difference \", \" I literally feel the same way and the thing is lately I've been running outside and it feels great but I'm missing out on weights in my routine because I hate going to the gym. My gym a few months ago wasn't that bad but as summer comes around and more people signed up after it opened up it's been so busy. When I go in I start working out just in my own corner and I don't mind when there are people it's more like when someone gets on a machine next to me I start to panic and its horrible!

Okay so, I’m 13, I have social anxiety, I haven’t went to school or barley went outside for a year. I’ve always knew that I was insecure. Ever since I was a kid, I had problems with certain body parts that I deemed as “imperfect.” But, it got worse over the years. When I turned 9, I started covering my face with my hair because I felt better if I wasn’t exposing too much of my face When I was 10, I started developing social anxiety and started wearing baggier clothing, I also started looking in the mirror for hours a day. When I turned 11, I started covering my face more than ever before, I’d only wear certain types of clothing that I thought were “less revealing,” my anxiety started to become worse than it’d ever been before and got pulled out of school for it. When I was 12, I started noticing changes in my appearance from hour to hour, or day to day, these changes were usually in my face. Everyday, I’d wake up and think to myself, “okay, am I gonna be pretty or ugly today?” I don’t really know what the real me looks like anymore, sometimes I barley recognize my own reflection. Sometimes I stare in the mirror for hours a day, just pointing out flaws or changes. Sometimes I avoid looking in the mirror all together. Most of the time I don’t even see myself as a human, or too ugly to even be a human. I’ve had thoughts of performing surgery on myself and imagining how perfect I’d be if I done it, but I try not to think about it. Everyday, I watch videos about plastic surgery. Somehow, I feel like all of my problems would be gone if I just changed some of my facial features, like I’d be able to live an actual life. I’d pay any price for it, I don’t care if it could kill me, I’d do it. When I used to go to school, I’d carry out certain ways of getting ready. I’d mainly go to school on days where I felt like I looked like an actual human, most of the times I’d just cry in front of a mirror saying to myself “you’re disgusting.” It’s gotten easier since I’ve stopped going to school, but it still bothers me a lot. Minor inconveniences like catching a person staring at me, or wind blowing in my face and blowing my hair away from it would ruin my day. At lunch and break, I’d sit in a bathroom stall looking at my face, most of the time, I’d look at it and wouldn’t wanna come out, then have to get sent home by teachers because I was too afraid to go into class. I’ve always held back from talking to people about how ugly I feel, especially my parents and doctors. My next appointment is next week, I’ve never talked to any of my doctors about me feeling disgusting, I’ve always just told them that I only feel anxious for no real reason. I think I might tell my doctor this week, maybe then I’ll actually begin to get better. I think most of the anxiety comes from me feeling incredibly ugly, so I think it’s best to work on that. Body dysmorphia is also a thing that people with social anxiety are more likely to have, so I guess it’s safe to say that it’s a possibility. I’m excited to talk to my doctor about this, because I feel like it might be the start of me actually beginning to feel happier again. I just don’t know if I should tell him about the wanting to perform surgery on myself, because he might see that as me having thoughts of self-harm. I usually don’t post anything on sites, but within the past few months, I’ve become more comfortable with talking to people. Anyways, leave a comment if you wanna say anything. (It feels kinda embarrassing saying “leave a comment,” because I know I probably won’t get any. But, thanks for reading anyways.)', 'Like the other guy/girl said its mostly Diet. Cut back on carbs and sugar and try to totally eliminate sugary drinks. Dairy can help a lot too! And for the boost and help that exercise makes, Go for jogs at night assuming you live in a safe area! Thats what I do! Between 1am and 3am nobody is ever out. Cars might drive by but at that time they are usually too busy thinking \"I fucking hate my life for being out this late im so tired\" that they wont pay attention to you.

The worst is, the \"do it often and it will pass\" method does NOT work. As a student living on my own I am often around people, in public. Guess what - each time going outside equals to mild panic attacks, stress, and tons of insecurity. I wanted to travel by myself but I am pretty sure I would get lost immediately or be hopeless. Add my IBS and that\\'s a total wasteland of nerves. I guess I am just not made for life, lol. ', ' I think I overwhelmed my therapist but here’s the good news. It’s safe to say that social anxiety is only one of my many problems. When I told my therapist about my anger, isolation, and history of drug abuse I saw a look on his face like “oh shit this guy is seriously in need of some help.” There’s a plus side to this though. I’m suppose to meet with him again in two weeks in November. My goal is to face one fear every single day for two weeks until my next session. I started today by walking the campus and meeting a stranger who also told me how lonely they were. Nothing major happened but I initiated the conversation and broke through the first stage of the anxiety. I didn’t waste any time making the first movement today. I’m bracing for these next two weeks so I can return to my therapist with news of improvement. If you’re reading this I know it’s hard as hell out there. When the fear of not facing your fears outweighs the fear itself, that’s when you’ll .find the motivation to change ', \" Some sort of weekly class. I'm not sure about yours, but my local community centres offer TONS of them. Art classes, dance classes, yoga, pilates, weightlifting, music. I started taking weekly ballet classes in an attempt to start getting out there. It was terrifying at first, but I quickly got used to it and actually took various other classes. It gave me a lot of confidence. I think the weekly classes are nice because you sort of know what to expect week after week. You grow comfortable with the people in your classes, which makes it easier to get to know them as opposed to seeing a group of different people every class. And the routine of it is also very nice. It's easier to convince yourself to go knowing that it's just part of your weekly routine. I've also started volunteering once a week for a few hours at an animal rescue. I work on my own for the most part, but talk to the other volunteers occasionally. That's kind of the nature of my volunteer work, but you could volunteer with a food bank or boys  and girls club, which would involve more social interaction. You're getting out there AND making a difference! Generally I think getting out of the house and doing anything is progress, whether you're interacting with other people or not. Because I'm not sure about you or anyone else, but when my social anxiety is bad, I retreat into myself and stay home where I'm comfortable. Just breaking that cycle by going for a short walk around the neighbourhood is a good idea. You could smile and say hello to people as you walk by, which may or may not be difficult for you or practice mindfulness. \", \" It is like before I was already very homey. I liked to be at home and I thought this job would be perfect for me. I think it is in many ways but I just dread my script and dread being repetitive it makes me wanna jump out the window.

I need to just face it and either find a new job or like the other comment says like try to be more present. It's hard when my anxiety takes over though. \", \"Calm the fuck down man. I'm 23 myself so potentially only 3 years away from your situation, and have the similar habit of beating myself up to extreme. You need to calm the fuck down.

If by fast you mean, rushing too much to the point of not really working on yourself but rushing into short term fixes then progress will ultimately be slow. Try to imagine yourself without anxiety, what would be the first thing you would want to do? Or if you'd prefer you could answer the question, what do you truly enjoy in life? This can be anything, no matter how small. Could be a song you like, food, an activity, a person, an item of clothing you like to wear, a place you like to be, doing chores, cleaning, writing, drawing.

Best advice I could give is to start using your mic in video games to talk to people. Build up your social skills with random people in video games and once you've developed your social skills enough to where you're confident then go outside more!

Use Psychologytoday.com if you need. Once you have a list of some that you seem to like the looks of then start working up the courage to call them. If you can't do it try starting by calling your mom or something to get used to the process of calling people if you have trouble with that. Once you feel comfortable enough (It will never be comfortable but it will feel better) then you call them. You ask to set up and appointment and you show up at that appointment. Don't give up if the first place you call can't see you. Keep trying. Then you keep seeing them. Do your best to be as open and honest as possible and actually try the things they suggest you do no matter how stupid or or useless they seem. These are trained professionals, not someone looking to make you into a fool. With some time you will start feeling more stable. Not better, but stable. Then you start trying to work on finding something you enjoy. Games, movies, music, dogs, reading, helping old ladies cross the street. It really doesnt matter what it is. Just find something that sucks less than the other things and keep doing it. Try and see if there is a way to help the social anxiety while doing that. If you like dogs, go to a dog park or a regular park and ask to pet someones dog. If its movies maybe try to go to a movie store or something and buy/rent/look at a movie. If its music go to a record store and look at what they have. Just something you can do that adds a social element to whatever it is you find you like. And keep pushing that boundary. Hows your hygiene? If you arent showering at least every other day. Start. There is literally not a single excuse for not doing it. It is a small change that can help you feel a bit more fresh of mind. Hell, make that your first step if you think looking for a therapist is too much for you right now. I don't really know how severe your Social anxiety is. I don't know a single thing about you so its hard to really say what you should do but there are some good stepping stones for you. Just to reiterate. 1. Try and find a therapist using Psychologytoday.com, look for someone who focuses in suicide ideation and self harm. 2. Try and find something that is more enjoyable than other things. Something to look forward to doing and just enjoy it and once you are into it more, try and incorporate social aspects into it. 3. Shower at least every other day (every day is preferable) I don't care if you don't think you stink. It will help you feel refreshed every day. It seems like bullshit but trust me. It helps.

Be confident, and comfortable in your own skin. Don\\'t let strangers affect your comfort level.

I struggle with anger as well and how to express it. Sometimes I feel like I'm projecting the anger inwards on myself. I wonder whether it would be a good idea for me to take up boxing, haha!

It's supposed to be a party, a time to relax, wind down, socialise. Many shy people get raised on this idea that they need to 'fight' and conquer their fears, but honestly, why even go if the only thing you'll allow yourself to do is fight with your back to the wall when things start getting tough. Nobody else is there to fight a war with themselves, why would you.

There's (usually) nothing wrong with people looking at you, it's normal. You're looking at them too, after all. Another thing is that they're likely more preoccupied with themselves and how they look than with you, so don't worry too much. It's good to occasionally take a step back and analyze your thoughts. Is there anything actually wrong with your legs, or are you just imagining things? Are they really staring at you, or is it in your head? If you can't deal with going out on your own, try going outside with someone you're comfortable with. This can help to take your mind off of things. Preferably someone who understands you're a bit anxious. Some people say music helps, but personally I don't do that because I feel it distracts me too much when I need to, say, cross a street. So you're going to a new school, then? Look up some tips on first impressions and making conversation. It's not always easy, and you're probably not going to be friends with everyone immediately, but as long as you stay calm and make the effort everything should be alright.

I only go out when I have time with my caregivers (twice a week) or want to visit a family member (Twice a month or so). I only travel with a cab.

Would be a good way to lose weight, have fun, be outside and maybe meet new friends. ', ' I’m a girl and I struggle with this as well with guys. I just want to tell you that your image matters, having unique style, good photos of yourself smiling helps. I’m pretty unapproachable as a girl because of my anxiety, if you look unhappy as a guy, it can be a lot worse because women are taught to be weary of men who seem emotionally unstable (like anger issues etc) (if you have rbf that’s going to work against you massively). It might help to take up some “feminine” hobbies, like knitting, yoga, dance, meditation (a nice neutral hobby). Along with a more outgoing sport (hiking, football, etc). This allows you to be in a space that can actually be helpful for your anxiety, along with interacting with women. Start trying to build friendships with women first, don’t go into relationships thinking they will be romantic, that will take a lot of pressure off of you. Also, don’t refer to women as females as a start. Humanize us as much as possible, educate yourself about women issues, but remain a listener in those spaces. I have yet to have luck with making guy friends, mostly because a lot of things guys find interesting (sports, cars, video games, smoking and drugs) I find boring, and I’ve found that a lot of men I’ve talked to simply aren’t interested in what I like and are less inclined to learn about what I like, I’m willing to learn about a sport a guy really likes, but I tend to sense they really aren’t interested in my own interests. I think a lot of women feel this way, they are expected to change their interests in relationships to suit their partner (not good for either sex, it’s good to find common ground or start something new together). Women are less likely to approach men. If you aren’t approaching us and we have to talk to you, it’s likely the girls you think don’t like you actually are reading you as being uninterested.

After all, remember that she was the one who reached out to you and have nothing to lose if it doesnt work out, all you gain is experience with girls. If the presence of your classmates in this relation is causing so much anxiety (as she knows everyone and would drag attention), mabey try asking her out to something simple. A walk to a park or just a nearby coffee shop.

I’m bad at my social skills whether it’s small talk, asking for directions, making friends, ect. I’ll myself am going to make a list of things on a spectrum. Via what’s the easiest  and what’s the worst. (Worst)Talking to a random girl on the street vs (easy)maybe walking into the bookstore to check out the newest book selection. Once you figure out the problems it’s much easier to dissect how to fix it. And since I’m bad at everything I’ll have to learn from the bottom. Idk if this is a real quote but “Everything in life is a skill, all you need is determination  and practice to become a master”. For whatever circumstances we didn’t master socializing as children (which is suppose to happen). Socializing is a skill, this is why it’s called “Social Skills” same with any sport or even Humor (great TED talk about this topic). Now since you know the solution which is = Repeated Exposure or Practice. This can be pretty tricky because you anxiety will do everything in its path to say “Go back to your comfort zone”. Idk where I’m going with this, I was trying to end on a good note but... I guess I would try to study your SA or whatever is causing these bad feelings. Since I’m a hermit I’m going to buy tons of Self-Improvement and social skills books and read on how to keep on conversation going, be interesting, those sort of things. Then I’m going to go out and experiment even if my anxiety says “No”.

I was later told by a rather irritated family member how rude I was being by staying out of the way. It was pure lack of understanding on her part (she and everyone-else are much more aware of my SA now) but it really hurt me at the time because there was nothing I could do to change how I felt around others, and the comment stuck with me.

In middle school was my first relationship with this girl named C. It started when I asked her to a dance (which was extremely nerve racking), and that was before my SA got too bad. It was a pretty standard relationship. We held hands and hung out. Then we broke up like 2 weeks later. Then at the end of 9th grade I started dating a girl named M. We kinda dropped hints that we liked each other but never did anything about it. A few weeks into summer I mustered up the courage and sent her a long heartfelt text about how I really liked her and whatnot. I wasn\\'t really asking her out, but just making my feelings clear. Then like a week later she asked me out and I said yes. I think we hung out once during our relationship then she dumped me about 2 weeks in with the classic \"It\\'s not you, it\\'s me\" excuse. Fast forward 3 years to the end of summer before 12th grade starts. This girl named D that I kinda knew from school replies to a photo of my dog on IG and we start talking. I really like skateboarding and post a lot of videos of me skating and she complemented me on those. I told her that I could teach her if she wanted and after a little convincing we decided to meet. Initially I was REALLY nervous about meeting her. When I offered to teach her how to skate, I was just being friendly in hopes I might make a new friend to skate with. However she dropped some hints that she liked me which instantly made me 100x more nervous to meet her. I made one of my friends come along because I know he\\'s goofy and would take attention off me if I needed. Anyways the meeting went well and D and I continued to talk and become more friendly. After awhile we both know that we like each other and are basically bf and gf. For some reason D had this idea that someone had to explicitly ask the other person out for it to be a couple. She told me she wanted me to ask her out and I said that it\\'s silly to ask someone to ask you out. If you both want to date each other and both know that you want to date each other, then you\\'re basically bf and gf, no need for someone to ask the other out. Anyways she then asks me out a few weeks later and so I guess that\\'s technically the started of our relationship, but it\\'s whatever. I think we dated for around 5 months. D was the first girl that I ever truly felt like I loved. I genuinely felt like I would do anything for her and that I wanted to be with her forever. Then what felt like out of nowhere, she tells me she\\'s not happy and wants me to do more for her. She wants me to know what she wants without her telling me. I tell her I\\'ll try my best and we continue dating. A week later she dumps me because she just doesn\\'t like me anymore. For a few days I was extremely depressed. I sit through school feeling numb, then I\\'d come home and lie in bed watching youtube until it was time to fall asleep. I was even somewhat suicidal at some point. She also got mad at me because one of her guy friends threatened to beat the shit out of me if I talked to her and I basically called him a retarded and messed with him a little. Apparently in her mind, me messing with her friend was worse than him threatening to beat me up and so she stopped talking to me as well. At that point I wasn\\'t as depressed but I was still sad. But about a day after she stopped talking to me I suddenly realized that I didn\\'t need her. After I realized that, I instantly became happier. I stopped caring about her and started caring about myself. I started skating more often and talking to friends. It\\'s been about a month since we broke up and I\\'m feeling better than ever.

I find that (as with anything) it’s important to not over indulge in the plant medicines and to allow your body to find its equilibrium sober, it helps the lessons sink in more.

It allows me to use up some of my anxious energy ', \"Tbh it didn't help me too much. In my opinion the best way in the long term: To stop overthinking is just doing something social over and over again. With time you are going with the flow and stop overthinking so much, because you have no time for that if you are preparing and going for next social exposure. Like, constantly be on the move. With time your body stops reacting with stress. In the short term: hm.. you can try to socialize after running. After doing something less socially bothering to gain confidence and to warm up first. 5HTP (serotonin booster, you can get it without seeing a doctor).\", \" Go out for a walk once a day additionally and slowly start increasing the time you spend outside. Try to go a different route everytime if it's not causing too much stress. If you live in a bigger town or city, go shopping instead of online shopping. Call some businesses and just ask random questions about their product. Start to go to a bar, at first during the week, later on weekends too. You don't have to talk to people just drink one drink and then go home after half an hour. Start doing sport, either outdoors or at a gym. If you trust her, talk to your friend about your problems. If you can, try to take your dog to a dog park or something like that. Try to make smalltalk with the other dog owners. These are just some ideas, but please take it slow and don't overburden yourself. The key is to slowly expand your comfort zone and your optimal performance zone without going into the danger zone. Ideally you would do this under supervision from a professional, like a therapist. If the topic is interessting to you, search for exposure therapy. Hope I could help! \", \" It'll pass and get better like it always doesnt with social anxiety but ours brains will probally have to relearn some stuff again. I also felt this a bit a few days also when I was getting some icecreams I felt like the shopkeepers were staring at me, maybe there were but its ofc never in a malicious way like we think it is. But this is somethign thats a basic task and something ive moved past a while ago, so I had deffo gone a bit backwards but its ups and downs always so im trying to keep positive. At least go out for a walk everyday! its allowed and its good for your mind, and everyone is out for walks atm as its the only freedom we get during isolation so if u keep doing that a few times youll have to come across people and at least make eye contact and say hello to them. So that will make it easier and keep things tying over till we go back to normal. \", \" Do you have a dog? If so, take your dog for a walk and talk to all the other pet owners. That's honestly what I do. Or go for a walk alone if you feel comfortable, and try socializing with other people out exercising and tell them you're looking for a walking/exercise partner. A lot of people are exercising outside more since gyms are still closed. \", ' Definitely get one if you think your up for it. I have a dog with me and it helps me out through a lot of things. If your also in a depressive state it’s good company to have to vent to and pet. And it will also give you an excuse to get fresh air since it needs to be walked. ', \" I feel like this a lot of the time too but I've noticed it helps when I focus on improvable skills. I beat myself up about not being charismatic enough or smart enough, but you know what I can improve on? Running, painting, writing, piano, etc. It has been sooo good for my self esteem to focus on activities like these. It's like that cliche saying about only focusing on being better than you were yesterday -- except it's sorta true lol. It's certainly not something that comes naturally but when you start setting goals and meeting them, it's incredibly rewarding and wholesome. I've never felt particularly good at anything either but now I can say that I run and that's better than nothing. \", \" something that worked for me is, i would put in some ear buds, sunglasses and go for a jog. nobody talk's to you because of the earbud's (and the music will help distract you) and nobody tries to make eye contact because your eyes are covered. this will help condition you to outside more, with the bonus perk of all the mental health benefits of running. \", \" It does help reducing my social anxiety. When I don't watch porn, I don't compare myself to other, better people and I feel less inferior and therefore less anxious. Anxiety is mainly triggered by inferiority complexes in my case. Also, when not fapping everyday for hours, you'll have more time to get social exposure or be in nature which both helps for social anxiety. Also more energy and slightly higher testosterone levels, resulting in less anxiety. \", 'Wow , exactly like me , same age but I’m male. Also got bullied In school and literally no one calls me. But even so , it ain’t so bad. Find music you like , watch series you want and read books YOU want , without any feedback from the others when you are lonely like me. Around 2-3 times in a week I go to run to release some pressure. It makes me anxious to run past people so my mind just push me even faster to escape from them. I just came to a solution - if I can’t connect to people, I need to fill that loneliness. If not - I’m going to get depressed, so that’s at least one way to make my well-being a little better. Also, I can’t stand social websites like Instagram or Facebook because of the photo stuff and the phony people so I just deleted my accounts, I don’t even have any profile pick in WhatsApp. Just make yourself feel a little better one small step at a time.

Hey guys quick question, I’ve recently discovered that if I run before a social event I’m the most confident person ever (especially with a beta blocker). But in the morning before exercise, I get watery eyes in public, feel ‘hollow’ and struggle to keep eye contact without crying. What’s going on?', 'I\\'m 19, and I think my social anxiety is gone but I believe it has caused some other issues. Well, I\\'m currently in my second semester of college and everything is online. I\\'m also working part-time at my third job, a walmart stocker... and well, I have been surprised that I have been able to talk to my co-workers and customers with no problems at all, really, no social anxiety. Now, it\\'s probably due to wearing a mask like when I had sunglasses on during my summer jobs.. However, I still have general anxiety about being rushed to finish things and that\\'s making me feel horrible, exhausted, and so stressed out Highschool is when it all started, my social anxiety. Before then, I always been an introvert who barely talked, shy, and had nothing really to say. When I did speak, often times I had to repeat it since no one could hear me.. I\\'m just naturally soft spoken I guess. My two older siblings have anxiety too.. (sorry about how I am texting, I\\'m tired and having trouble putting this together). Uh, highschool took a toll on me and it was draining. Symptoms that I remember: erythrophobia, serve trembling, jerking, and shaking in my neck, head, hands, shoulders, and torso, feeling like I can\\'t speak because my voice would be all shakey, sweating excessively, overthinking, tearful eyes, and fast heartbeat. All of this made me the popular loner, everyone liked me but I never talked much. I did have a few groups of friends that made life easier.. Though, I was that person who was terrified to be alone at lunch. I\\'m 6\\'2 too, and I felt like I stuck out too. Reading became my habit because it was an excuse to not having to do social activities All of this made me go to sleep wanting to, well, die. Kind of embarrassing to say this but.. I usually fantasize myself dying before going to sleep, and it helps me fall asleep. It\\'s like how I say, \"I\\'m going to quit my job\" which makes me able to get through the day. I dreaded school, just like I do with work, but for stress, and well, yeah.. I don\\'t know if I still have social anxiety? I mean, yes, I never turn my camera on in school but I have no problems at work. I don\\'t like speaking but I can speak not without a shakey voice. I gotten used to my heigh and I don\\'t shake as much as I used too.. Did I finally, after 5 years of fighting it, win? I\\'m not smart, honestly, to never seek help.. I do regard myself poorly.. I don\\'t think I\\'m intelligent.. smart enough to succeed in this world. I don\\'t like myself, how I look, the way I act, think, and how I can\\'t maintain conversations since it\\'s boring or how I don\\'t want to talk, like, at all. perhaps I\\'m in denial about being depressed.. I probably should quit my job too and Idk, try to tackle it on my own again.. However, I had the whole beginning of Covid to do so.. but I just wasted time.. I\\'m scared to seek help because it\\'s going to be embarrassing.. And really, I have memory problems and well, I feel like I\\'m going to forget what to say. This is why I just keep ignoring everything.. Laying in bed all day or sitting on the couch watching YouTube or tiktoks. My life before covid is the same as now.

So I went up to a cute girl in a park, started chit-chatting, and just as I was leaving I asked if she wanted to go on a date with me. My hands were shaking so bad and I could barely speak, but I got her number and we're going out this week!\", \"Where does your SA stem from?. **I realize most people with SA probably don't know the answer to this question, or they know wrong one. Obviously peoples' anxieties have different backgrounds and triggers. I want to know what yours is, I'll tell what mine is and the fact that I think this the most common one. Mine's self-worth, and that includes physical appearance in a major way. Just recently I started talking (and literally haven't stopped since then other than when we're asleep) to a girl I've liked for a year who has also basically liked me for the same amount of period (yeah guess what, me being fucking borderline autistic made it so that although we both liked each other and basically both *knew* that we liked each each other it still took a year) and my general social anxiety is practically gone. It's absolutely still there for majorly uncomfortable situations, but stuff like interaction with regular people, my peers, walking around outside without being bothered by others looking at you is gone. And I think that the number one reason for that is because I now realize that I am, or I can be desirable to some people. The girl I'm talking to, if leagues exist, I'd be in league 1 and she'd be fucking infinity and yet we're practically together. I know this post comes off as sorta braggy (which might have even been my subconscious goal) but I really think we have to seek out that one person who really cares about us to realize how much others might (potentially) care about us. Please share what you think where your SA *really* lies.\", 'Sharing my experience of Social Anxiety for the first time.. Hi, before I begin talking about my social anxiety, I would just like to say that this is not my usual account, I created this because I feel that it would hinder my ability to properly express myself if I use my personal account. Sorry if this infringes on any of the rules, I am not totally familiar with them. You can take this down if you want or let me know and I will fix/take it down for you. Im 18 years old, male and I believe that I have some form of social anxiety and I want to share how it has so far affected my life. I recently started university in the UK and I am in a flat of 13 other people. My earliest memory, and I believe one of the causes of my social anxiety was Christmas day when I was about 6 or 7. My Uncle came to our house for the first time (he lived in another country) and he brought a camcorder. He filmed us opening our presents and I was so excited I always wanted to be on camera and see myself on the TV. When I heard my voice on the TV aged 6, I wanted it turned off immediately. I try never to speak on camera even now. I have usually found it really really hard to make new friends. If I make one, I latch on to him as much as possible and usually divert any conversations to them if someone I know tries to initiate a conversation with me. Im currently at 6 weeks into university and I haven’t made any friends, which is my fault because I don’t initiate any conversations and any conversations that I do have last around 6 seconds because I don’t know what to say to people. Its usually, goes “Hi, (insert name here)” - Other person “Hi (insert name here)” – Me “How are you?” – Other person “Good, you?” – Me “Im good” – Other person “That’s good” – Me (Awkward pause and I walk off to avoid further embarrassment) I promised myself that on the first day I moved in I would introduce myself to everyone but when I walked in, they said hi and I got really hot and flustered and couldn’t. I rarely leave my room, only to go to lectures and seminars (which I worry about hours beforehand) and I often go days without eating proper food because people are currently in the kitchen. At School it was a little bit of a benefit because while people would take time in their work to talk, I would out of awkwardness, concentrate fully on my work. Now at university, they suggest that you join or form a study group with your friends, which is hard because Im on the other side of the country and I have no friends here. I am really worried how I will communicate with others when we have to start giving group presentations and working in groups. We haven’t even been assigned one yet and it already takes up hours of worry in my mind. I am worried because I want to be successful at whatever it is that I am doing but I cant properly talk to people and I know that this will be a huge hindrance. I have never approached someone of the opposite gender and talked to them, I don’t know what to say. I only have one friend who is a girl and its more a friendship of association because she is my friends girlfriends. One of the feelings that I get when I am around people is a feeling of inferiority. I am 5 foot 5, which is small for a male, and have always been the smallest in my class. I have been mistaken for up to 6 years younger than I am and I think this is one of the causes of it. I cant just talk to someone for the sake of it I have to have a reason otherwise I would be wasting their time. If someone else initiates a conversation with one of my friends or vice versa I stand there really really awkwardly. I cant wait in queues with a whole bunch of people because I feel like I am holding them up. If I am waiting to go into a lecture, I wait towards the back of the group because I don’t want to add to their displeasure of waiting. Its almost as if, subconsciously, that my presence offends people. Not that I think that I am in any way important, quite opposite, I feel like a nobody. If there was anything important that I needed to ask someone about that I didn’t know from school, I would do it on facebook, and even then it would take a few hours to come up with what I saw as the right way to frame this. Even for this post, I have to keep reminding myself that it is anonymous. My parents don’t know how seriously it affects me. They think Im shy and often when I was younger they would get cross because I wouldn’t socially interact with other people for summer camps, for example. Anyway, the purpose of this post was to share my experience with social anxiety and at least get a little bit of the pressure off my chest. Having not talked so freely in my entire life it feels that I have had a little bit of word vomit. I tried to make this post as coherent as possible Thanks for taking the time to read this.', \" While in bed, do you sometimes get pumped to solve your problems but when you wake up all that willpower is all lost?. It can also happen while I'm scrolling through Facebook. I get the willpower to go on a diet and to take a walk outside but after a while I go back to being depressed in front of my computer. This bugs me so bad. \", \"I have no idea.... This is most likely going to be long, and pretty scattered. I'll keep details to a minimum for the sake of saving time. My 'issues' started when I was 15, as far as I know. Right before my birthday I had gone through what I would consider to be a traumatic experience. And so began the slow and dreadful downhill spiral into complete nothingness. First I was just homeschooled. Then I lost all contact with supposed friends. Then the outside world completely. At this point I was still functional enough to mow the lawn and go to basic places like doctors, dentists, grocery stores, etc. Those eventually all stopped and I isolated myself, pretty much professionally if I do say so myself. After a while of kind of enjoying being alone I started not enjoying it so much. I found myself daydreaming of having friends and those memorable moments that don't take place on your mom's couch. And after not too long of that, I started feeling like I would die without it. But I didn't know how to talk to people anymore. What to say, how to act, what to do. In just a few short years I forgot how to be a human. I still have no fucking clue of what to do in social situations. But, and now fast forward to the present. I don't like people anymore and now those 'dreams' of having friends have turned into full blown nightmares of having (keyword having) to do stuff eventually. I can't just hide from the world my entire life no matter what 'reasons' I have. It's confusing though. I never maintain the same perspective for more than a few days. Some days I wake up feeling lonely, and praying for someone to text me. Others, I wake up not even being able to stand my little siblings saying good morning to me. On top of that, there's not voices, but there's definitely two different versions of my voice in my head. I'll attempt to provide at least a decent example. Version #1, I feel like I have a 2 foot dick just blowing it in the wind as I sit comfortably in my high horse and look down on all the peasants. Version #2, I feel like I have a 2 inch soggy day old breadstick from Little Caesar's say between my legs and I'm nothing more than the scum of the earth. (The dick metaphors are the best representation of one's ego I could think of. Just go with it. Pls.) Then there's the personality aspect of it. There's day where I talk to people on Skype and I couldn't be happier. I enjoy the shit out of myself and act like an idiot just for a good laugh. Then there's days where I wish I could hit the lottery. Just to hire a group of Russian mercenaries to kill all the stupid people that annoy me. The worst part, I'm not even talking about genuinely annoying. I'm talking about my version. Example, someone asking me a question that I feel is pointless, makes my head ring, and I go back to the thought of hiring mercenaries. I can't really explain this part well, but I feel like people do shit on purpose. There's NO way the general public is so stupid, and annoying that I actually pray for mass genocide on a daily basis. It just seems like something that can't be true. Right? And for me to have such a passionate hatred towards people in general when not everyone has ever done anything to me. I don't know. This is getting to the point where now I'm confusing myself, so...\", ' Out of the frying pan.... And okay for the moment. I had a \"job\" for several months (my first job), and I only held on for so long because I always felt my mother leaning over me with a gun to my head. I didn\\'t know what she would do and it frightened me, so I kept on pretending to work being too scared to do anything that required interacting with someone else. I had some serious panic, anxiety, depression, all the good stuff. Now we\\'ve all moved and my mother is allowing me to work around the house tending to the garden and stuff and everything is simmering down for me. I\\'m starting to feel okay, like, you know, sane. I have some understanding of my own surroundings and life doesn\\'t feel like one big long nightmare anymore. I just wanted to share, even if no one reads this, how much I appreciate being able to rest, away from other people (I pretty much haven\\'t spoken to anyone outside of my family since a week before thanksgiving). It\\'s therapeutic. ', 'I was just assaulted by a gang of teens. :/ So, I was walking in the park and I saw a gang of about 15 teens maybe 13 years old or so. I\\'m always aware of everyone because of my anxiety so I did have thoughts about how maybe they would do something to me, but I have that thought every time I see a gang of young people (I\\'m only 24 myself) so I dismissed it like I always do. I just walked past them, a bit nervous but overall calm and not expecting anything to happen. Out of nowhere some kid slams into me from behind, I actually thought a tree branch had fallen on me or something at first. I was facing the other way so I didn\\'t really see what he did but it was like he slammed his whole body into me or something. Just totally unprovoked. I pretty much blend in, there\\'s literally nothing about my appearance or demeanour that would offend or piss someone off but they apparently decided I was a good target. I almost fell over and at first I was so shocked that I didn\\'t say anything as they walked away (just walked, didn\\'t even try to run) and my anxiety kicked in and I thought \"just don\\'t say anything\" but then about 10 seconds pass and I decided to shout at them. The time elapsed probably gave off signals that I\\'m not very assertive, plus my anxiety was probably evident so they just laughed at me and ran off. I continued walking, feeling pretty shit about myself. I sat down in my usual spot and I tried to relax but I couldn\\'t. I felt really anxious and shaky. I\\'m a pretty sensitive guy anyway, but this is something I\\'ve never experienced before and I kept playing over in my head how lame I sounded when I shouted at them and I actually felt like crying. While I was sitting under a tree, feeling terrible and trying not to cry in public I saw them come back over to me and one of them threw a rock at me. It didn\\'t hit me, but it freaked me out. Then before I could say anything, they started throwing rocks at windows, trying to break them. Seeing them again actually made me feel calm, my anxiety lifted. I was really nervous about passing them again to leave the park, but then when I saw them I realised they were just a bunch of idiot kids and I felt alright. Anyway, I called the police and they picked me up in a van and we drove around the neighbourhood trying to find them but couldn\\'t so they drove me home. I was hoping we\\'d catch them, because even though that would mean I would have had to face them again, I kind of wanted them to realise I wasn\\'t some push over who just allows kids to assault me. I wanted to talk to them again and teach them a lesson. But overall it worked out fine, so I\\'m happy about that. I tried my best and I feel good now, as opposed to anxious and shaky. I see lots of people asking here if you can overcome social anxiety and I\\'m not sure if you can get rid of it completely - maybe - but I do know that it can be massively improved. I used to be agoraphobic, I was afraid to leave the house because of the people I\\'d have to encounter. Now I can leave the house and do things that I never thought I\\'d be able to do. 5 years ago I couldn\\'t even pick up a telephone and now I can deal with high-stress situations like this without completely breaking down. I definitely could have handled it better, but I did my best and hopefully stuff like this will make me more socially hardy. It\\'s totally possible to improve guys. :)', '\"You should be out there enjoying your life\". So I was happily working on my garden (I was preparing a bumblebee hive), enjoying the sunny day. And out of nowhere this scumbag neighbour of mine appears, staring at me through the fence. Don\\'t know for how long was he standing there. I say \\'hi\\' and he just replies: \\'Man you should go out there and enjoy life while you\\'re young\\' and goes away. Made me so angry, why the fuck can\\'t people give me a break even when I\\'m on MY garden?? Yes I know at 23 yrs I should be out nonstop partying, getting wasted and having casual sex 24/7. So now I can\\'t catch a break even when I\\'m right outside of my home. Damn I should build a concrete wall around the house. Sorry for the rant, I just needed to write it out. :(', 'I did it! I got my hair cut!. Im going to apologize in advance and just say that I often give too many details in my stories making them very long but that\\'s just how I do it. I like to explain everything. My thought process what I was thinking and feeling.. A few days ago I realised that my hair had gotten pretty long. It had been around 3 months since my last haircut. I know it was before December 24 2015. For a few hours last night before I went to bed I was trying to look up places I could get my hair cut. The price and how long it would take to walk. Every time I\\'ve had my hair cut and the hairdresser asks how to cut it I just stutter a \"err idk just shorter. Do what you want\" and in a thread I\\'ve made before about getting my hair cut people were suggesting that I show a picture of what I want done. So I looked up pictures of myself on phone and narrowed it down to 3 pictures I believe were taken a week or two after I had my hair cut. \"This looks short enough. I\\'ll just show them this\". The whole day leading up to me entering the door to the haircutter I was thinking \"should I go. Should I just do it another day\" but each step I took (eating breakfast, getting dressed, going outside) that got me closer to the haircutter the more forced I felt to actually go through with it. I tried to think less and just do it. The place is a rather small place and you can\\'t even pay with a card, only cash (as I found out) and the guy who cut my hair didn\\'t speak the language very well. When I went in there were 2 employees and the boss. All being with a customer and cutting their hair so I sit down and wait. Usually the place is pretty full (as I said it\\'s a pretty small room) and I was worried about looking like a fool in front of other customers trying to ask if they had time for a drop-in customer. A lot of people who go there seems to be friends with the owner too or know them very well which makes it feel worse. Like if the owner is just a complete stranger to them then we have something in common. I sit there for a couple of minutes and the owner (who\\'s cutting someone\\'s hair) makes eye contact with me like he\\'s wondering what I\\'m doing. Making me feel anxious ish. A guy walks in, he clearly knows the owner, after a bit he asks how long until he\\'s free. Owner says 5m and the guy goes outside to smoke or whatever. So there I am, just sitting there awkwardly, wondering if I should be asking if they have time for a drop in or something. Or do I just wait here until one of them is done cutting and stands behind the register?? Ofc i chose to sit there like a socially awkward dude. Once the owner is done with his customer he starts to get ready to go outside for a smoke break. I didn\\'t stand up or talk to him I just sat awkwardly. I felt like I had missed an opportunity. But a minute or so after that the other guy was done cutting his customers hair too and I asked him if he has time for a drop in and he said yes. And here\\'s the best part. Remember, this is the very first time I was going to show the haircutter a picture of how I want mine cut, so I had rehearsed it a million times in my head already. Show picture, say I want something like that, sit down. I awkwardly say \"is. . I brought a picture\" I pull up my phone which has the picture already loaded. \"Something like this?\" He takes the phone and asks \"do this?\" I\\'m like ..yeah do that. Like that. A few moments of silence after I sit down, he seems hesitant to cut it like that. \"Like that or.. better\" NO YOU\\'RE DEVIATING FROM THE SCRIPT. \"Ehh heh better I guess if you can\" are the words that leave my mouth. He says \"this picture.. not very good. Not that good looking hair\" I\\'m like well shit I spent like 10 minutes anxious over which picture to use and it\\'s not a great pic I agree but it\\'s fine. It\\'s short. I just want it shorter. So I say \"heh yeah do better if you can then. If you want\". \"I can do better\" he says and starts cutting. Once he\\'s done he says something and I was like huh what did you say? I asked that maybe 2 to 3 times during that whole visit. I felt like such an incompetent ass. Oh remember how I didn\\'t know it was a cash only place? He said nope sorry can\\'t pay with card here. And I\\'m like oh god.. \"where can I find an atm..\" he says around the corner \"you know where?\" I Say no and he gestures again around the corner. So I go around the corner but see no atm I ask 2 women passing by where the nearest atm is and it\\'s a biiit further away. Around another corner. I feel like the haircutter might think I\\'m not gonna pay so I had intentionally left my jacket behind. Had to stand in line for the atm (lady took god same forever) and I was thinking about how long it was taking me to get back so I could frikken pay him. Anyway I finally had it done. Usually my dad drives me to some place and comes with me (since he has to wait for me anyway) which makes me feel like shit and like a child. I\\'m 22. It looks good now I think and I rode the high of \" I did something today \" for a few hours after that. If you actually read everything then I\\'m sorry haha. I should learn how to be more concise but I just feel like I want to convey every detail possible. As if the person listening to my story was there. That\\'s why I like pictures. Shows what it actually is like instead of them having to imagine it. Maybe it just looks like a lot cus I\\'m on my phone. It\\'s still a lot.', 'being sober at a party is literally my worst nightmare. i had a really shitty time at a party last week and its been making me feel like crap for a while so i thought id take the chance to get it off my chest. Basically, i got invited to a house party of someone i never really hang out with, which was a pleasant surprise, but at the same time it made it even more intimidating as it wasnt really my crowd. Thankfully though, 5 close friends of mine were also invited (like 60 people there in total) so i had the courage to show up. To drown out my anxiety at parties, i tend to drink lots of alcohol (pretty common among 16 year olds to get completely smashed at parties) but the problems tend to come later on in the night when i sober up. By the time i sobered up at around 11, i suddenly started becoming anxious and self conscious, and just felt like complete shit. I slipped out of the house into the garden and hid round the side of the house where no one could see me and waited it out on my own until my brother could pick me up. Anyways, the next day i go onto my phone and see pictures on instagram of my friends having the night of their lives. And for some reason, every time i look at them, i just get this feeling of regret and sadness that everyone else seemed to be enjoying themselves while i was shutting myself off and hiding away from everyone feeling miserable. So yeah, dont mind me, just thought id get it off my chest. Anyone else here get terrified of people at parties?', \"I am so bad at interacting again..... Feels like I have no friends :(.. I've been already suffering from social anxiety since ever I was bullied in my school 5 years ago. Few months ago I was getting finally better and better after being anxious for years.. Now since at least February or March, everything became as bad as before, almost everyone I know are ignoring me because I am too boring due of my anxiety. Some even bullied me about it. I am just literally forced to stay and be alone all the time. Recently, it got way too far that I feel too bad/depressed about my inability to talk with people and that I am alone all the time, makes me sometimes suicidal as hell. I don't know why almost everyone ignores me when I am a purely good person. I just sometimes can't find what to talk about, especially with my girl friends and only saying hi to them only makes them think I'm boring and I am not really worth to talk with. I almost never got invited to hang around outside or to birthday parties in my life, all I do is sit at home infront of my computer all day. Although, I've finally hanged outside 3 weeks ago with 2 of my new friends, started to be a bit boring to them, just like with others :(. All of my classmates don't care even slightly about me and pretend as if I don't exist at all. To be honest, my biggest dream is that I would finally wake up socially active, not anxious, many good friends to talk for a long time, hang around together, don't get ignored by about everyone. I don't know what to do about myself, I am so inconsistent in socializing and it makes me feel very bad about myself, lonely, friendless, depressed and suicidal. I tried everything, and today I didn't talk with anyone :(\", 'I can\\'t be alone. So here it goes.... I\\'m a 20 yo male from the US. I have been consciously struggling with social anxiety for about 3 years now. I really don\\'t know where to start because my anxiety spreads across many categories. The most prominent and most harmful,though, is my fear of rejection. I am constantly dwelling on my peers\\' apparent perception of me. After every action I make, whether it be getting out of my chair or commenting on a coworkers statement, I analyze the body/facial expression of the other parties in the room. Most of the time my interpretation is a negative one. I am a first born child and am comfort able with my alone time and quite enjoy it but my ADHD makes me outgoing and talkative (though sometimes about obscure topics). I very much enjoy the connection from carrying on a conversation with someone and knowing that they understand and empathize with you. Throughout high-school I was the class clown. I always had some snide remark to make or an opinion to give on everything. I had my small group of friends but I felt that I annoyed even them. I graduated HS and decided enough was enough. I\\'m not gonna be that obnoxious guy anymore. I got back on my medicine and went off to college. Screwed up pretty bad my first semester and got kicked out of my housing (still enrolled ). I felt horrible about it because the offense that got me kicked out was something I told my parents I stopped doing a while back when they caught me. Anyway.. At this point I had just started to make friends outside of the people I knew from my hometown and I could see things about to turn around. But when I found out that I was being kicked out of my housing and wasting my parents 8k they had already spent on the following semester housing as well as the rent for the new place I fell into a really bad depression. I lost connection with all of my friends except one( who happened to be my previous roommate and got kicked out with me). We felt each other\\'s pain and consoled one another with alcohol and Xbox one. I started drinking .. A lot. Like everyday. Ironically it didn\\'t affect my grades though because we were still in freshman level courses and Calc always came easy to me. Fast forward 1 year. Me and roommate get a new place together and are doing great(or so it seems). We move into a little college apt complex where I already knew a ton of people. That first semester was great. We got along great daily and never fought. Shit we still have never fought. We hung out with the same group of friends and I was even more popular than him! I was having a great time and really loved my roommate/best friend like a brother. Then winter break came. All was going great. Still partying in my hometown and catching up with old friends and still hanging out with the ones that came home from school with me. Blah blah blah I ran into a girl from one of my classes downtown one night and we made plans to hangout. I brought a friend she brought a friend. The friend she brought ended up being my girlfriend and first love of 2 years. And my friend and the other girl hooked up a little but that\\'s a different story.... Getting tired of typing on phone so I\\'m gonna wrap it up ... Roommate and Girl from downtown start talking. (Me and that girl always had some spark between us but never made a move on it again story for another time) girl talks shit about roommate behind his back to me (dumb) calls him gay and says she only hangs out with him for a gay cuddle buddy. I tell him he doesn\\'t believe me. Asks her she denies it. She keeps talking shit. She starts getting really controlling and making him look like her puppy following her around and conforming to her every whim. It was nauseating. At this point there was a little tension between her and I as I was obviously not gonna take her side on things because she was manipulating my best friend and I was pretty blatant about that. But I decided to take the high road and still be her friend and what not. Things started to go south. She started to act weird and say passively rude things to me when she was drunk but never out right aggressive. She started to resent my other friend (the one that hooked up with her a while back ) and would be very aggressive with him at parties. To the point of getting him kicked out of a few. I didn\\'t care, he was being an ass most of the time and deserved it. Then she started lumping me into her little outbursts. And one night she got particularly drunk and went off on him. Once he was kicked out she turned it on me. I didn\\'t even listen to it though cause she was obviously obliterated so I just walked home. Next weekend there was a birthday party down the road from me and she was going as well as all my friends so I decided to go. Stayed for an hour or so but didn\\'t know many people and was getting bored so I went to leave. Said my good byes to the people I knew there and went for the door. Saw roommate and girl sitting by the door. Said bye to roommate and went to say bye to her but she was obviously ignoring me so I patted her lightly on the head and kindly said \"bye \\'girl\\'\" and opened the door. I hear \"did he just pat me on the head?? Is he calling me a dog or something ?!?\" I try to b line out of this drunken situation before it manifests into a full on shit show. But I was too late. She runs for the door and shoves me as much as she could and yells \"GET OUT!\" ( her signature drunken outburst at the time ) I turned around and calmly said \"\\'girl\\' I didn\\'t mean to offend you, we\\'re all friends here I\\'m sorry, you\\'re just drunk\" or something along those lines. She stops her feet in place and yells for roommate at the top of her lungs. And like clock work he comes running out of no where and stands by her side. I had had enough so I just grabbed my girl by the arm and we walked home. Then things started to get weird. I talked to my roommate about it and asked him why she was mad at me. He said she wasn\\'t. Okay cool. So i tried talking to her and she ignores me. Okay so I ask him again same response. Wtf roommate bros before hoes right? Apparently he had never heard the expression. Then a day would pass when I didn\\'t see or hear from him. Which hadn\\'t happened since the day I met him. Oh well I figured I\\'d let them work it out. Then weeks passed. Then we\\'d talk about bullshit. Then more weeks. Then a month. Then the semester was over and he left without saying a word. We had already signed a lease for the next semester and he told me a week before the next semester that he had backed out last minute and was living somewhere else. Great Well he moves in with some of my so called friends and then I lost contact with most of them as they were girls friends before mine. So I was slowly phased out of the group and then was all alone. And social anxiety has just snowballed. TL;DR : best friend didn\\'t listen to bros b4 hoes and then took all my friends and left my by myself. Now I\\'m overly worried about being accepted', ' Contradicting feelings. Wanting both to be around people and to be alone.. I read a post on r/depression or here that the person felt.. isolated. I\\'d say that\\'s accurate. In every situation where I\\'m in a group feel like I\\'m not part of the group. I\\'m just.. there... Sometimes I want to be all social and shit but at the same time there\\'s a part of me that doesn\\'t want the attention. I get very self conscious. They\\'re looking at me now; am I sitting weirdly? Am I holding my arm in a weird way? They made a joke? I get out a short laugh. Now what. It feels awkward to just keep looking at them. It\\'s also weird to just look away and basically ignore them. I\\'m so socially retarded. At work, at like a shitty call center or whatever, people are always talking to eachother. Sitting together, talking and laughing before work starts and during the break. I never say a word. I get there, I stand alone until work starts and during the break I just sit there or go outside for fresh air and do shit on my phone or something. Then back to work. Occasionally I\\'ll exchange a word or two with someone sitting next to me. That\\'s kinda nice. It\\'s sorta like.. at moments I want to talk and be social and shit but part of me feels like that if it\\'s successful and I\\'ll be obligated to be social in the future and I just don\\'t have the energy for that I want to be alone. But at the same time not. Sometimes someone on my left and someone and my right talk to eachother and I\\'m just there, on the phone, between them being slightly envious and annoyed at the same time. Sometimes I\\'ll be like nope not gonna be affected by these dumb emotions \"just don\\'t care\" \"just don\\'t give a fuck anymore\" and then I\\'ll actually see a person or be in a social situation and I\\'ll feel all awkward and shit. Can\\'t mind-over-matter it. ', \"Friends in Atlanta anyone?. I'm In Atlanta. A 21 year old guy who just needs more friends lol. I'm a gamer and an introvert, I am Mexican who enjoys the simple life.

Like go swimming. I was anxious for days but ended up texting him. He had other plans. I was a bit proud of myself for actually texting and relieved I didn\\'t \"have to\" hang out with someone. I\\'m the kind of person that just waits for things to happen to me. I follow the flow. Because I\\'m socially anxious and depressed I have no ambitions or future plans or aspirations or anything. I just wait for things to happen. I don\\'t initiate. Note I don\\'t really like this about myself but yah. Next time I met him we talked, he bought us both an icecream each, and suggested swimming again. When In the moment like that I feel like I should say yes, that it\\'s probably \"good/better\" to actually socialise with someone. So I said yes. We\\'ve gone swimming two days in a row now. And afterwards we go pick some berries. It\\'s been OK. I\\'ve felt dumb cus I didn\\'t know the answer to some things. I felt boring and awkward because I didn\\'t have a reply for most things. Like talk about cars and I\\'m like uh yeah. Mhm. I don\\'t know how he\\'s not bored of me. But he asked if I wanted to go swimming again. If he asks a question like A or B? I just don\\'t know. You choose. \"You wanna keep swimming or should we get out?\" uh sure let\\'s get out. : |. I\\'m just.. following along.. Even though it\\'s been nice I guess, I kinda feel like.. I\\'m waiting for it to be over. Waiting for me to go home. At the same time I enjoy his company? It feels wrong.. to feel like this. Like.. this isn\\'t how normal people are supposed to feel. Like I was slightly bored when we were picking berries. And it\\'s like ahh I\\'m alone nice. That\\'s kinda nice. But I\\'m bored a little. I\\'m a walking indecisive contradicting blob.

So I'm gonna be a senior this year and I've been doing cross country bc I knew I would regret it if I didn't do it at least one year. So I head to this camp, all is well until today when we had this trip to the dunes. Long story short I was at too fast a pace to want to stick with one group of girls and too slow to catch up with another group that was headed much farther out. I ended up running on my own for over an hour and a half until the assistant coach found me. She went to tell some park ranger that she'd found me, and then ran with me to the rest of the group. She explained how they were looking for me and all that, which was when the anxiety started kicking in. When we joined the rest of the group it was super awkward.. the other girls kinda looked at me and this nagging thought/feeling kept telling me I was a major inconvenience to them and that I had ruined what could have been a perfectly nice outing. I felt/feel that no one really wanted me there. I'm worried that it seems as if I was slacking off or something to them when in reality I was running the whole time, worried and anxious, swatting away at/plucking off ticks that landed on my head (I was running through a wooded area that was kind of swampy in some parts). I probably seemed like so stupid and childish, what kind of 17 year old gets lost in the woods. Today was horrible. I hate this feeling.\", 'Memories of the past are tormenting me.. I know I have whined about this in the past at some point here or another site maybe. But when I return to my parents house, it all slaps me back and I feel depressed again. I\\'m a 23 year old female, have been struggling with SA in middle school ( at that point i had no idea what i had) which got significantly better at highschool and deteriorated after going away for college. Most people become more outgoing in college since parents arent there to hold you back, but not for me. I got closed up in my shell even more and managed to even lose my old friends, one of which had been my friend since kindergarten. Everyone moved out for college, and after i tried many times to keep in touch and hang out, they always cancelled and never initiated anything. It pains me so much to think about how adulthood changed us to the point of having completely opposite interests. The few times we met during college, I felt like they were different people. It\\'s been years since i cut off all ties and i have no friends at all. I sit outside at night and remember our mischiefs and sleepovers and i want to cry. I feel that even in my teens i had this spark of adventure, you know? I was terrified of social situations but i won over it because I thought of everything as an adventure. Now as an adult, i have no interest in anything. Every person i meet is just another \" normie\" i have to deal with. Every social situation is something i have to avoid at all costs, or endure until it is over and i can go home. When I was a teen, I had a different image of my future self. Strong, confident, a smart computer engineer with a job and degree. I am none of these, i haven\\'t even finished college. I feel i am a disappointment to my old self. To my young self who desperately wanted a change. It feels like i am growing inside a box, only the box size stays the same and it\\'s more and more suffocating. How do I stop getting haunted by those memories and feeling like shit? Also, sorry for the bad formatting. I am typing this on my phone.', \"Can't make new friends. I have social anxiety. I think it started when I lost contact with my childhood friends. We were really close. Now I have trouble making new friends, approaching people. I've just come home from a summer camp and I can't get one girl out of my head. I had a crush on her and I really liked her as a person but I couldn't talk to her unless I'm drunk. I felt so terrible. I was afraid that i'm being obtrusive and she's not interested in me at all. I wanted to get to know her so much. I'm 15 and I have no friends but I'm usually okay with it. I could make some but I just don't like people I know. And when I finally meet someone I like I become too nervous and I can't make a conversation. I feel like I'm ruining my life and there's no way out. I'm crying a lot and loosing sense of self sometimes when I'm around people.\", 'Friendless people, the key to not feeling like the worst person in the world is to stop caring (to state the obvious). For a while I never understood people who posted on here and on other subs saying they have no friends but they\\'re okay with that. If they\\'re okay with it it won\\'t change! But I was wrong. 90% of people are going to think you\\'re a weirdo for not having friends, but they don\\'t know you, and they\\'re shallow. No one is going to support your loneliness so you might as well accept that sometimes shit happens in life and you end up alone for a while but that\\'s okay and natural. I think the guilt of loneliness affects your mental health before the actual loneliness does. Growing up I became more and more aware of my lack of friends. I had more friends then than I have now, but less than most people I knew. For a long time I didn\\'t see the problem. When I didn\\'t see my lack of friends as a problem, this meant that when I was having a social interaction I wasn\\'t self conscious. I didn\\'t have my mothers voice in the back of my head telling me I should have more friends. I remember in school, between the ages of 12-16, I would yap and yap to anyone, and no, I didn\\'t make friends with everyone I talked to, but I made some, and was generally liked. As I got older, I cut off a group of friends from my home town because I had nothing in common with them and they were preoccupied with being popular and I wasn\\'t. My mam would always say that I needed more friends when she noticed I stopped hanging around them. I remember I brought 2 friends home for dinner and my sister said \"oh look, her friends. All 2 of them\". I became more aware of my loneliness. As my awareness increased, I got more withdrawn, basically a hermit, was overly critical of myself and overly self conscious. Because everyone around me was telling me it wasn\\'t okay to have few friends, even though I had been happy. Something that struck me in college was how everyone sort of acted as if they wanted to be perceived as popular. This was probably my warped SA perception, and this stopped me from talking to people. Sometimes I read threads here, particularly /r/relationships (my favourite sub) and see people talking about how having no friends is a \"red flag\" and that \"boring people finish last\" and that when you have no friends \"you\\'re the common denominator\" and there\\'s something wrong with you. I see where they\\'re coming from, and while reading things like this serves to make us all more self aware, it doesn\\'t make it easier, and it\\'s not healthy to blame yourself. I had an epiphany recently and I realized that... people in my hometown probably don\\'t talk about me negatively, if I talked to them they\\'d probably be open to me. People I meet daily that I think hate me, don\\'t hate me, if they do they\\'re basing it off one encounter, they don\\'t know me and I shouldn\\'t care. When I walk my dog, people who see me out in public don\\'t know I\\'m unemployed and friendless, or that my hair is really greasy. No one but me has felt my pain or understands, so screw it. Even if I have screwed up my reputation by being a recluse, it\\'s so easy to change how people see you, if you only have the courage to try. There\\'s no point in feeling guilt about SA. We are going to find friends at some point or another, our SA will die down eventually with personal growth or outside help. We might as well be okay with our circumstances in the meantime. I used to spend all my alone time (so, all the time) feeling bad about it, but what\\'s the point? That will only make me more bitter. Let\\'s stop acting like having no friends is the worst thing in the world. We\\'re not actually missing out on much, maybe this realization will help us to stop trying too hard in social situations and messing up. Loneliness is painful but only because other people make it painful by reminding us how flawed we are. I know it\\'s impossible to implement \"stop caring\" overnight, but please try. I hope other friendless people out there can get to the point in life where they don\\'t care what others think, because after 22 years it has finally freed me. *Tl;dr: People make us feel shit for not having friends. But realize if people didn\\'t make us feel shit about ourselves, we\\'d probably be okay. Try and get to the point where you realize that it\\'s okay to be who you are and be happy alone. Stop comparing yourself to others and just stop caring what people think. Don\\'t let people\\'s opinions of you drive your self esteem into the ground*', \"I have social anxiety because of my looks..

It took her a small fraction of a second to shout 'creeper' rather indiscreetly to one of her colleagues somewhere else. Suffice to say, it was rather awkward after that and though I ordered my latte and put my music back in my afternoon was ruined. It was horrible. I might have done something wrong to offend her sensibilities but I assure you it was nothing 'creepy'. I thought I was playing by the rules, walking the tightrope, but it seems I upset her. And I feel bad about it, I hate feeling awkward, irritating, creepy or scary. I keep making an effort to pass off normally (nice clothes, exercise etc.) but why should it be so hard?

I am not sure how to message ppl on here but feel I'll just vent anyhow... I have basically had depression since the age of 12. I have spent my entire teenage life caring for my Mother who worked construction her entire life which was detrimental to her health. I remember as a child an incident where she went into the hospital because she mentally checked out because of the pain and when she woke up she lost her memory for two weeks. As a child I was confused as to why she couldn't remember me. So much has happened that I started blaming myself for the way she was and hated myself for living because she wouldnt be working so hard if she had me. I also have a special needs brother who she and I cared for also when his attendants working. I was home schooled so I missed out on my education because of caring for her full time. I did however get my GED in the year of 2014..this gave me confidence that I wasn't completely worthless and that I was capable of doing something other than playing video games and loathing in self-hate. I was sheltered and remember it being so bad I would only go outside once a month for a year. I wanted no parts of living but my Mom was my everything to keep going. I got to the point that I had to have a break, so I made plans for my Aunt to care for her just for me to leave to get myself together. This time I was gone, I found fitness, nutrition, yoga, meditation which made me feel happy and in control of something in my life for the first time. 7 months of this and I get a call that My Mom has passed away....I dont want to go too much further into it but ever since then I have lost that motivation and passion of waking up and feel myself sinking back into that sad girl who locked herself away from the world......I know it's something I have to do for myself and that I have to want it bad enough to break out of it but it's so hard and I never ask anyone for help...ever.

Incoming wall of text, bear with me. So I\\'m good friends with my neighbors and I was at their place hanging out when they decided they want to go bar hopping. They asked me if I wanted to go and I decided what the hell, why not? I\\'ve never been bar hopping, not even a bar since I turned 21 (in April. Normally I just go to the liquor store down the street and drink with my roommate or by myself). I told them I\\'ve never done it before so if they could guide me through it that\\'d be great, and they said sure. So it comes time to start walking. One of the guys is already drunk, the other is super experienced with this stuff. I felt so out of place. Not to mention they were wearing shirts that supported the home team (football game AND homecoming tonight, that alone should have told me it\\'d be way too busy for me to handle, especially for my first time at a bar). I was wearing what I normally wear, some jeans and a black sweater and nasty grey vans that I wore to work today and forgot to change out of. Not to mention these guys are way taller than me. I\\'m not even short, I\\'m 5\"11 but they were a few inches taller than me so all of this combined made me feel so out of place. So basically I was going into a social anxiety nightmare already anxious a fuck for other reasons than I was going out. Fuck. The walk took about 15 minutes, felt like forever, but when I got to the bar, I felt like it didn\\'t take long enough. This bar was packed beyond reason. Inside it didn\\'t look like there was anywhere to even move. And the line was massive. Halfway up, my friend decided now was the best time to mention there\\'s a $5 front. I didn\\'t know what that meant (in case someone doesn\\'t either, it means a $5 fee to get in). I had already told him I didn\\'t have any cash on me but he said don\\'t worry, they take debit cards. Here\\'s where I really start to panic. I ask if he can spot me and he said no, I should have brought cash with me. Fucking hell. Second panic: the people behind me are so close, like they kept brushing up against me and bumping into me. I can\\'t stand people touching me unexpectedly. But I\\'m at a bar, obviously that happens. But I start to freak out thinking the people around me can hear me say I don\\'t have the money, asking me friend, not knowing what to do, thinking they think I\\'m a loser for not knowing how to do this. I\\'m just about to leave because I\\'m about to have a break down. I tell my \"friend\" I think I\\'m just going to bail. He\\'s like yea okay whatever. I then start thinking the people behind me are thinking I\\'m even more of a loser for bailing and not doing what everyone else is doing. I end up saying fuck it and I start walking away. I walked towards the Taco Bell across the street and call my roommate and ask him to pick me up there. He said he was actually on his way to his girlfriend\\'s. I said oh never mind then, I don\\'t want you to drive all that way. He said it\\'s not a big deal and he comes to pick me up. Now I feel bad about inconveniencing him. So now I\\'m home by myself and alone with my thoughts and self loathing. I already told my boss I\\'m not coming in tomorrow because I\\'m going out, further inconveniencing someone else. Thinking about getting drunk as hell just to say tonight wasn\\'t a complete waste. I don\\'t know what I was thinking, going out for my first time to a bar on one of the busiest nights. I just felt like a turd the whole time and felt like I fucked things up over and over again. Sorry for the huge rant. Anyone else have similar experiences they want to share because of their SA? Update: it\\'s 2:39 am now and I\\'m alone and drunk. Friend told me the night ended being shit anyway, they didn\\'t get into the really busy bar. They went to one crappy bar and I turned out to be a really shitty night all around for them. Also I guess someone threw away or ate the other half of my McChicken that I left at their place and now I\\'m sad.', \"I wasted the past 8 years of life thanks to SA. Looking for advice.. I'm a 25 year old man. I've dealt with social anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember, but it really peaked around 8 years ago. I dropped out of high school, stopped going outside regularly, and I've mostly been holed up in my house on the computer, afraid to even talk to my neighbors. I have no skills or passions or friends. I don't even know how to navigate my own city. Now that I'm halfway through my 20's, I've hit my breaking point. I think 2017 is the year where I'm finally gonna put my life back together. I plan to see a psychiatrist, get a GED, a job, an apartment, maybe even start dating. It's scary as hell, and I feel dread just thinking about it, but I can't afford to wait any longer. The alternative is that I live with my parents until they die, and end up homeless. Does anyone have any advice for someone in my situation? I feel like I'm starting from scratch.\", 'As a homeschooler, I feel like something was stolen from me.. Hello everyone. This is my first time posting here, I\\'ll try to keep it simple and organized. I have been homeschooled from Pre-K to senior year, and I am 18 now. For the most part I have been oblivious to the public perception of this method of teaching. I see everywhere online that it\\'s kind of frowned upon. People say that homeschoolers are anti-social white-trash potential school shooters. Everytime I see these comments I feel a strong pang in my chest. I actually don\\'t consider myself to be very weird, I am kind of average to be honest. I am obsessed with music, love my netflix, and enjoy travelling. Not very weird I wouldn\\'t think. I try very hard to hide the fact that I was homeschooled, simply because I immediately get lumped into these stereotypes. As a homeschooler, I feel like something was stolen from me. I never asked to be different. It doesn\\'t feel fair to me that I have this burden of an alternate lifestyle. I think it kind of stems from my personality. I hate conflict and hostile opinions. Which might be caused by my homeschooling. Such a mess right? My mother has a strong passion for homeschooling, and I remember her telling me that she would cry if I decided (or got forced by CPS) to go to public school. This created a sort of \"guilty conscious, or feeling that I have to stick with the program to keep her happy. She would actually threaten to \"put me in public school\" if I tried to talk to her about my doubts. Don\\'t get the wrong idea about her though, I love her and can kind of see where she\\'s coming from. She may have had a bad time in high school, so it\\'s like a terror to her. But, I don\\'t feel like I would have had the same experience. Sometimes I daydream about what I could have been like if I went to public school. Maybe I would some kind of sauve marauder! Or at least I would be assertive enough, self-relient, and have a good group of friends. Instead, I am just an awkward burden for most people my age. I feel like I was cheated a better life almost. I also have extreme insecurities when it comes to intelligence. Actually, anytime I think I see proof of my being stupid, I respond emotionally. Again, the pang in my chest feeling. I feel like my education could have been better, for the past few years I have mainly been teaching myself because my mom is hella busy. I am working on my ACT and I\\'ll hopefully get into college, which I am not sure I can do since I am a homeschooler. I don\\'t even know if I have a GPA, because there hasn\\'t been any kind of grading going on, not that I know of anyway. I am really good at math, but not so good at factoid/common-sense stuff. Right now I am in a jiu-jitsu class (free at my gym) and my instructor will constantly ask for a factoid, like \"How much blood is in the body?\" or \"What\\'s the fastest animal on Earth\". I couldn\\'t answer either of these, and it really bothers me. I feel like I should know this stuff, and I might have known it if I was in public school. Sometimes I will know one, but can\\'t think of it fast enough. Somehow, I always end up looking like an idiot in front of my class. Whether it be not answering questions, or having an insanely hard time with directions and spatial awareness. Yes, the homeschooling was for religious reasons. My mom says it\\'s because she met a homeschooler and was impressed, but I kind of doubt that. She\\'s an extreme Christian of sorts. She taught me creation science for a while, but I learned how it\\'s fraudulent. I have a basic understanding of evolution now, but I probably don\\'t know as much as other people my age. She\\'s also a big conspirator. Alex Jones, 9/11 Truth, FEMA, etc. I believed these too, but have since shaken them off. I am actually still in the closet about a lot of this stuff because I don\\'t want to have a heated discussion with her. I am still a Christian, but I have a lot of problems with religion. I guess it\\'s more of a personal thing that I don\\'t feel the need to express or go to church for. I have never had a girlfriend. I have never even had a kiss before. I have held hands with a girl and I took one on a date. But, the date was a disaster (she was kind of a bitch, and she didn\\'t consider it to be a date) and the \"holding hands\" part grossed me out. It\\'s starting to drive me crazy in a way, I really want to experience love, romance, and sex are like. But I feel like I have been permanently cockblocked by my upbringing. I\\'ll probably die a virgin. Anytime I have been close to starting something up with a girl, my mom wasn\\'t too far behind me. I feel like once they see my mom and the interactions we have, they write me off as a \"momma\\'s boy\" and immediately lose any attraction they once had. I am actually a pretty attractive looking guy, but the way I am drives them away. I have never had a job (unless you could call mowing your grandmother\\'s grass a real job). I have a supreme fear of the unknown here. Like I feel like they won\\'t hire me because I am not the best at social skills. Or, I feel like I am going to fuck up really bad with whatever they assign for me. Or, I feel like I will get bullied by coworkers and have a horrible time there. The real world is a scary concept to me, I have seen how horrible people can be on the internet (especially with the \\'kys\\' and red hot angry comments). I feel like I am too soft for the world, too sheltered. I feel like I will get eaten alive almost. So, it creates a vicious cycle, I don\\'t know when I\\'ll get a job, or what job I will get. But I know I need to get one because I\\'ll need a source of income soon (I rarely spend my money, so I have a lot of it). Because I don\\'t have a job and don\\'t exactly have a \"rich family\". I don\\'t have a phone, or a car. I have to use my parents phone and car anywhere I go, and I hate it. It severely stifles my freedom. I couldn\\'t go do anything without them knowing, I know this for a fact. My dream is to shed the stereotypical image I have and live a meaningful life. I want to have good friends, a wife, a good job, a house, etc. I don\\'t want to be seen as that weird guy, or that loner, I want to be somebody. I don\\'t know where to start, even though I was brought up in a good household (no domestic violence or anything), I carry a lot of baggage. Thanks for reading, it feels so good to get this off my chest.', 'I negotiated a 10,000$ increase to my salary. Hello SA, I want to share with you guys a milestone that I never thought I’d ever reach, and furthermore, a milestone that the past me would never have even dreamt as possible. My hope is that I can inspire people to see that it is truly is possible for anyone to massively and significantly improve themselves and fight through their own social anxiety. Warning, this post is quite long, but if you enjoy reading about a person’s journey’s to self-improvement, then this post is for you. A bit of backstory on me. I’m 22 right now, but I’ve been fighting social anxiety ever since I was in fifth grade (that’s rounds out to about half of my life). For as long as I remember, I hated myself, and there was a multitude of reasons for this such as growing up poor in a rich area, being different from all my peers (mixed race, foreign sounding name, etc.), and not seeing a healthy relationship between my mother and father. The way I coped with my insecurities was through video games. Lots and lots of video games. It was so easy to escape the reality I hated by living in another one that made me feel alive. I did this for years and years, throughout middle school and especially through high school and into college. With all the time I invested into video games, I was severely underdeveloped in my social skills, and I’d even pit myself in the bottom 10% next to anti-social deaf people. Everywhere I go, I would avoid eye contact with people. I hated even going outside and seeing other people, because I just knew how awkward and weird they would think I am for the way I looked and the way I walked. Class was a nightmare. I’d try to sit in the back, and every time the teacher would call on me, my heart would race to the speed of light, and my voice would quiver as I attempted to formulate a semi-coherent sentence. By now you might be wondering how the hell did I transform from this video game addicted, socially awkward boy with low self-esteem into a person that could stand up for himself? Answer: I got tired. Tired of living life feeling like a piece of shit. Tired of not even being able to look into the mirror without cringing. Tired of thinking I wasn’t worth anyone’s time, and that I’ll die alone. And that’s when I discovered /r/socialanxiety. For the first time I saw that I wasn’t the only one in the world dealing with what I thought was my own unique personal hell. I heard stories, stories of peoples’ struggles, and even some of their success. But to be honest, I never found enough actionable advice here to steer my life in the right direction, so I started looking elsewhere. I started looking at other subreddits, and I even started reading self-improvement books and listening to podcasts. Somewhere around this point, something finally clicked in my head that me realize that change is possible, “even for me.” Here are three steps I followed to transform my life after believing that I could transform my life: Step 1) I started an exercise regimen and eating healthier. Even though my routine sucked and I made every mistake in the book, the small progress I made further made me see that I could improve my own physique through grit and not shoving junk food down my throat. Let’s not kid ourselves, appearances do matter, not so much that they should dominate every ounce of your thought and life focus, but I’ve come to learn that neglecting it and pretending like it doesn’t matter only perpetuated a cycle of negative thoughts about myself such as “I’ll never look good, I’m not like that, I’m ugly, etc.” If you feel ugly now, working out and dressing decently can unsurprisingly improve the way you feel about yourself. Try it. If you’re fighting social anxiety like I was, you’re going to need every bit of improvement you can get and this one can even be done without any social interaction (though that is against the road of improvement). Step 2) I started paying attention to my body language. I think this may be one of the hardest points to tackle as a person with SA, and I can’t even say that my own personal body language is in tip top shape as of yet, but I can say that even by being aware that body language exists puts you miles ahead of the average person with SA. So much communication is portrayed through the body, such as standing up straight, not looking down at the ground, and even just how you deal with silence. If you’re a guy and you’re into girls, this a quality that is heavily observed, much more so than the verbal communication. If you’re a girl, you probably know this and have more of knack for this than the average guy does. However complicated this may seem, simple things that I mentioned such as standing up straight and keeping your head-up can psychologically boost your mood. Step 3) I did things I was uncomfortable with, step by step. I think this is the hardest and most crucial step of my process, and it could be divided into countless sub-steps and stories, but I want to hit the main point that the only way to become comfortable is to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. Here’s an example. I’m at grocery store, I really don’t want to ask the worker for help finding an item. But I do it, just to see what will happen. I’m nervous. I approach her and ask where the broccoli is. She tells me it’s on aisle seven. “Shit I don’t where aisle seven is, should I ask her, no she’ll think I’m weird.” I nod okay and walk away quickly. “Shit, why didn’t I ask her to point me to where aisle seven is .“ I find another worker, then ask if he can show me to aisle seven, and sure enough he happily tells me where to go. I realize this isn’t so bad and am now not afraid to ask for directions. The point of this example is take small steps and experiment for yourself. The more you do, the more you will learn. And I hate to say it, but most of what we learn isn’t through others, but by our own doing, and especially doing things that we think will suck. Now I could tell my own personal stories on this topic for pages and pages, but I want to highlight that I’ve done things as uncomfortable as confronting someone about their shitty behavior, asking girls to dates (*gasp*, no way, how is that possible, as my old self would say), actually being on the date and making mistakes (learning mistakes I’ll have you know), and even performing on a stage in front of a live audience. But the most recent highlight is negotiating my salary at my current job. I did my research about my current job that I’m getting hired for, and I noticed that I was being heavily underpaid for the position. I knew that being underpaid would make me feel resentment as an employee and not allow me to do my best work, so I decided “fuck it, rather than have a terrible time at this position feeling passive-aggressive about my situation and being weird in the office, I’m going to tackle this right now.” I looked up as many negotiation tactics as possible, spent time in the shower for a week debating with my manager in my imagination, and finally reassured myself that I know my worth. I approached my manager 2 days ago. Long story short, I nailed the negotiation and got a 10k salary raise. All the uncomfortable things I ever dealt with leading up to this made me the person I was going into that negotiation. All the hard work, mistakes, pain, and learning that I did made me become someone who was worthy of that 10k raise. If you threw 16 year old, or even 20 year old socially awkward me into the same position, I would not have not have raised a single word. I probably would not have even passed the interview for this job. As long as this post has been, there’s so many details that I left out, but I really hope that I’ve demonstrated that it is truly is possible to fight your own social anxiety, and even use it as fuel to better yourself. I still have lots of room to grow, and I’m not the most socially savvy or charming person you’ll ever meet, but I can say with confidence and pride that I’m 100 times better than the person I used to be.', ' Will soon be having a conversation with my manager about my SA... Hey guys. So I\\'m a lower level supervisor where I work and today I had to get together with a group of my co-workers and my manager to go over some things that they (co-workers) haven\\'t been completing on a consistent basis. Performance stuff basically. My manager and I had talked the night before about how we were going to approach the meeting and we agreed I would try and take the lead on most of the conversation and he would chime in when necessary. He, as well as a majority of management (big company, lots of higher-ups) know that I have some anxiety issues, but don\\'t really know the extent of it for the most part. So the meeting didn\\'t go all that great. Not terrible, but not very good. I started things off and kind of just nose dived into what the group of co-workers had done wrong the day before. No intro, no nice lead in or explanation as to why we were there. Just \"ok so this wasn\\'t done, that was dirty, this wasn\\'t taken care of..\" etc, etc. My manager ended up back-packing the meeting per usual and the day continued on as it normally would. Well towards the end of the day he wanted to get together again (just him and I) so that we could talk about how it went. We go into the same room where we held the meeting that morning which is this bright ass (like apple store bright) conference room and we start to chat. We go over some normal day to day stuff and then we get on the subject of how we think the meeting went. I told him I think it could have gone better and he agrees which is why he wanted to talk with me to begin with. I told him I\\'m particularly aware of my public speaking difficulties and that I know I could have directed the meeting in a more constructive way. I told him I struggle with certain things and that I\\'ve been devoting a lot of time outside of work to try and help with that stuff. Then he stopped me and asked me what type of struggles.. I paused for a second and said \"oh, well I have anxiety and uh..\" pause, not looking at him.. \"it\\'s just been really hard and, uh..\" At this moment I started to well up with tears. He could tell I was on the verge of crying and I knew I would if I said anything else so I told him I needed to step away for a second. So I stepped into an empty office and just tried to wait out the emotion. I was completely, utterly overwhelmed. After a couple minutes he came over and asked me if I\\'d Iike to walk outside with him for a bit. We took a walk around the neighboring businesses while I, thoroughly embarrassed, stammered out the few sentences of explanation that I could (I should say that my manager is a really good dude, fairly close to my age and also super understanding). He let me know that he\\'s all ears if I\\'d like to try and talk about everything at a later time as I was just about finished with my shift for the day. I told him that I\\'ve actually been wanting to do that for a while so we agreed that he\\'d give me a call within the next couple of days to discuss things.. I know I need to talk about a lot with him, I just don\\'t know *how* much. Do I tell him the full truth? That I\\'m severely depressed because of my SA and that if affects me every day of my life? That it drastically inhibits my ability to perform as a supervisor? I was on the verge of breaking down at work which is something I\\'ve never done, ever. Let alone in front of my boss. I\\'ve spent my whole life trying to hide my SA and have developed an ultra thick, guarded wall as a result. I\\'ve avoided these types of conversations with people (other than my family) because of how overwhelming the emotions become. I\\'m scared that if I completely open up to him I\\'ll raise serious questions about my ability to perform my job requirements. Either way, the dynamic between him and I will absolutely not be the same after this convo. This post became way, waay longer than I meant it to be. Cheers if you made it all the way to the end. Thank you..sincerely, for any responses. TL;DR I ended up nearly crying in front of my manager after being overwhelmed with emotions when asked to elaborate on my struggles with SA. We planned a follow up conversation at a later time so that I can gather myself and allow for a proper explanation. Now I\\'m just not sure how much I want to share with him as I\\'m scared it might jeopardize my job, or at least my standings within my department. ', \"18  and useless. My story of Social Anxiety. I used to be that funny guy in class. In Elementary  and Middle School I was always the guy that tried to make everyone laugh but made a fool of myself. Looking back now I realized at a young age I was scared to talk to girls. In the 3rd grade I had a PSP that I would go on Facebook with  and just try to socialize on there. Every year I spent locked up in my room just watching videos on YouTube, playing Xbox  and barely socializing. I never had a girlfriend but always talked to girls over twitter  and instagram. I graduated high school with a 2.30 gpa  and didn't learn a damn thing. I'm going to be starting my 2nd semester at a Community College but have no desire to go. I have no passion or goals for my future. I'm not working because I am literally not good at anything  and am terrified to socialize with people. Don't get my wrong I have two great loving parents  and two younger sisters. I feel horrible because my younger sisters look up to me and I'm a horrible role model. I hate school so much but what else am I going to do with my life then? I'm starting to lose my two closest friends because I never want to leave my house. My mom practically does everything for me. Whenever I do go outside I have the ugliest look on my face because I just hate my life. I was prescribed an antidepressant but didn't take it because I'm afraid of the side effects. I often think about suicide by overdosing on the pills but that would just crush my family  and put them in serious debt with the cost of my funeral. I just wish there was just a reset button so I could live a completely different life. I feel so alone  and see nothing for my future.\", \"I think I had a little breakthrough on why I have SA. so this might be a bit of a read and I'll try to keep it short. So ever since I was born till about 5th or 6th grade I was always a outgoing kid just the polar opposit of how I am today. I wasn't shy I could male new friends and talk to other kids with no worries at all. I went to a school that was k-8 I stayed there all the way till 8th grade and so did pretty much everyone from my starting kindergarten class did the same so we were real close shared birthday parties , had sleepovers all of us were on a soccer team for a good while. But at around 5th grade i started to get a bit chubby i dont know if it was pubery or my aunt always giving me treats. And the same friends who i had known since kindergarten started teasing me not all but most also we were kinda finding who we were and making our groups of friends. So this put me down to where i didnt wanna go to birthday parties anymore or do things with them because i knew I would be made fun of or called fat or asked why my face was red all the time so i started staying home alot. My dad didn't like this so he would make me go to these events where i would be teased. I never told him and I would have to make a scene to not go. So he gave up on me going and i kinda just stayed at home all the way till we graduated till 8th grade I wasn't the weird kid everyone made fun of i had friends i guess I just got used to being teased brushed it off and all that bit it bothered me i would have breakdowns cry askingy parents if I was fat. I went to a different high school then everyone else didn't grt teased and felt a bit better i geaduated got in shape and all but all of that just kinda left a mark. I feel i dont have social anxiety because while i do get nervous going to a interview or meeting someone or starting a new job. I more freaking out oit about what the person thinks about how i look how i talk what I say how I performy duties. Pretty much the teasing i endured and kinda sucked up and bottled up left me with a inferiority complex, slight case of body dismorhia, and extremely low self esteem that all form this trifecta of shit that causes me to think I have social anxiety when really its just all those other things Tl;DR my social anxiety stems from being teased and mocked for being a chubby kid in elementary causinge me to have low self esteem, inferority complex and slight body dismorhia. Sorry I know the punctiation is shit on here im writing this on the bus ride home\", \"Should I talk to her?. This is going to be a long story as there is a lot of backstory/context needed to understand. Those who are ‘meant’ to read this  and offer guidance, will. I hope :) No idea how to cut it down into a TLDR as it is far too lengthy. I'll try to keep this first backstory as short  and to the point as possible. I'm 21, live in Australia on the east coast, grew up in Sydney and lived there until I was 18. I have a sister who is 7 years older who still lives in our hometown. Lost my father at a young age at 13. I've been battling depression for over 5 years since I was 15. I moved 2 hours away from my hometown at 18  and my depression got much worse. I stopped seeing friends, stopped going out, stopped talking to my friends/family which led to dealing with anxiety issues which led to social anxiety due to isolating myself. (Among other symptoms) I've recently started seeing a psychologist, getting out of the house more, I'm finally starting to feel like going out  and doing things. I want to meet people. I've been out more/done more in January of this year than I have the past 2 years. Finally starting to feel 'normal'. I still haven't reconnected with any of my old friends. I haven't posted anything on my personal social media accounts (Facebook/Instagram/Snapchat) since I first moved in late 2014. Haven't spoken to any friends since then  and haven't seen them either. Some have reached out to me but I never replied. Haven’t had a job since I moved up here either. For some reason I'm still afraid to reach out to them because I know that will lead to eventually meeting up with them in person. I'm even afraid to post anything on social media from fear of them reaching out to me. Because I know this will lead down the same route. I haven't made any new friends since moving from my hometown, haven't worked or studied  and basically feel like a complete failure. Afraid of what they will say, think or feel about me cos I have no life per say. I have already made a post looking for advice/guidance regarding the issue related to my old friends, however the above context was necessary to lead onto my next story which I am solely looking for advice/guidance for. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ New years eve I went to a house party with my older Sister cos I had nothing else to do, literally, and met all her friends etc. People were drinking, majority of people were on drugs, MDMA, LSD  and Ketamine was available. I hadn’t had drugs for 3 years since Australia day in 2014 when I was 18. I didn’t plan on taking anything. I met a girl who lived there, friend of my sisters who’s my age - lets call her Mary. I was told by a few people she thought I was attractive  and wanted to hookup. I haven’t hooked up with anyone for over 2 years and I actually was thinking that about her anyway so I was keen. I was drinking a lot when I first got there because of my anxiety, meeting new people etc. and ended up having to stop drinking because I was getting sick mixing it with weed. (Only drank 4 times last year so I had a very low tolerance). A few hours later I was in Marys room with her, my sister  and another girl who lived there just talking; lets call her Barbara. Barbara asked if we all wanted to get any more MDMA caps (her bf had stuff people could buy during the night). All of them had already taken an MDMA cap each earlier on in the night  and they all said yeah to having another one, which left me to decide; I ended up asking for one since I felt comfortable, didn’t feel pressured by them and the moment felt right to do it (granted my judgement was way off cause I was drinking/smoking; not the best idea to jump on drugs with people you barely know, but I felt safe being with my sister). So I took mine with them  and they left me and Mary in the room not long after. Started talking to Mary, getting to know her and all that. Basically having a d andm. She was telling me that she is going overseas this year to a US summer camp for 6 weeks. I felt so unaccomplished  and like a loser basically because there’s no way I could do that. I told her she’s really ambitious  and we started talking about other things while smoking weed together. We ended up hooking up for awhile, kissed at midnight  and started talking more after that. At one point while we were outside having a cigarette, she asked me to tell her ‘my life story’, it caught me off guard cos if I’m honest I don’t even know what it is. I got about halfway through  and somehow we got interrupted and I never got to hear hers or finish mine. I realised I was saying a lot of bad things that had happened in my life, rather than who I am and what I do? Anyway, Mary  and Barbara decided to come back with me, my sister  and her partner back to their place about an hour or two after Midnight to spend the rest of the night together. They were all going to take a tab of LSD each when we got back, I didn’t want to have psychedelics so I had a second MDMA cap. When we got back to my sisters place , Mary  and Barbara lost an acid tab when we got there. Eventually we all gave up looking for it  and they all took a tab each. Not long after taking the tab it got kinda weird with her, her vibe changed  and she wasn’t talking much, we weren’t as ‘close’ physically as earlier (not cuddling n stuff) but we were holding hands? They were all waiting for the LSD to kick in  and everyone wasn’t really talking much, and cos I hadn’t taken a tab I wasn’t on the same ‘level’. I think that’s where things changed cos my 2nd MDMA cap was coming on while her tab was coming on so we were on different wavelengths. We were all chilling in the lounge room laying down for about an hour and it was pretty obvious Barbara was the 5th wheel. Mary, her friend  and my sister went into her room and were talking for awhile. Eventually they came out and we all went for a cigarette on the balcony and they basically came and said they were leaving. They were going to stay the night then an hour or two later after we got back they said they were leaving cos her friend wanted to be with her boyfriend. I was too out of it to leave the unit  and when I said ‘I’m too f*cked to leave when Mary asked me if I was coming she said 'well your ambitious’. Never has my gut dropped so much. Instant regret. Such a horrible feeling, intensified by the drugs. I’m sure they left cos they started feeling uncomfortable being there, particularly Marys friend being the 5th wheel without her BF on new years eve. My sister, her partner  and I all planned on coming back to their placed to end the night there regardless, a safe place to come back to. So we kind of all had it in our head that we weren’t leaving after we got back. Looking back I wish I went back with Mary  and her friend but it probably wasn’t the best idea because they ended up taking another tab and ‘day-tripped’. Which could have ended up quite messy since it was pretty messy after they left anyway just being with my sister n her partner. Who knows what would happened - I never will know cos I chose not to go. I told my sister n her partner the next morning what Mary said when she left  and I asked them if I screwed up by not going back with her - my sisters husband said yeah i thought I heard her say something like that but my sister sort of dismissed it. They were both pretty adamant that I hadn’t ‘fucked up’ though - the next day my sister said she spoke to Mary on FB and asked her about what she said before she left that night  and she said that she didn't say that at all, something like 'oh alright then' was what she apparently said but I didn't really believe it. Mary sent me a message first on snapchat a couple days after new years basically saying ‘hey was nice to meet you had a nice time  and we said we should chill n have a sesh sometime’ etc. So we started talking a little bit, went to buy weed from their place a day later  and added her on FB but didn’t ask for her number. Such an idiot. Anyway, It was my sisters birthday the first week of 2017  and she had a party the first weekend (7th Jan - Saturday), Mary  and I were both going so we were going to catch up there. I was talking to her leading up to my sisters bday party after i came home on the Thursday and then the next night I had a panic attack after smoking some weed (happened cos of repressed emotions from traumatic domestic event in late 2016)  and went to the doctor the next morning for a referral to a psychologist along with some sort of temporary medication to help me sleep  and I haven't spoken to her since. And with all my anxiety i'm afraid to even talk to her because its been over a month and she probably thinks I’m a rude douchebag but then again she may not even think twice about it. My sister said she knows I have a lot going on in my life at the moment so she probably doesn’t mind. I felt like I got attached to her way too quickly after that night, or perhaps attached to the idea of potentially being with someone? Since it had been so long since I’ve actually had that physical connection with someone it was quite difficult to just ‘let go’ and forget about it. I became afraid of this attachment and decided to stop talking to her to detach myself, I didn’t want to come across as needy or obsessive. Couldn’t stop thinking about her for 2 weeks afterwards. Avoiding talking to her ended up making me think of her more. She hasn’t messaged me since I didn’t reply to her last message so as far as she’s concerned she may not even think about me at all? When I was younger I used to talk to girls day  and night (not exactly proud of it) but my point is I had confidence, I wasn't anxious or insecure - like I’m too afraid to even message Mary? I just feel awkward after hooking up with her, when I went to her place  and added her on FB I was so awkward around her, didn’t know how to act around her after hooking up  and being so f*cked from the drugs lol - I just want to be able to talk to her and get to know her,  and i don’t really feel like getting to know her through text is how I want to do it either, I’d rather do it in person. But then I’m awkward in person after hooking up lol, don’t how to be. Don’t know what to do, she keeps popping in my head. Feel like I’m not worthy enough, not enough self worth  and confidence. No job, no car, no license, no friends, what do I have to offer? I lift weights, I’m fit, I’m healthy, I’m intelligent, I’m educated, own my own business, I feel like I’m attractive - definitely not ugly, but can barely bring myself to message her on Facebook. Am I just mentally stuck on this whole thing? Do I need to let it go  and move on? I know the next move would be to reach out to her again  and eventually ask to meet up in person  and go from there. But my social anxiety is stopping me. I feel like there is a lot that has gone unsaid between us that should be spoken about  and idk if thats me overthinking it but I don’t even know how to bring that up to her either. I feel so weird thinking all of this when I barely know her. I just don’t know what to do, or how to ask her how she feels about the whole thing cos apparently she got out of a year long relationship herself  and according to my sister ‘she probably isn’t looking for anything’. So as far as Mary is concerned it may have just been a one time thing to hook up on New Years; I don’t know her well enough to make that judgement and don’t feel comfortable enough to talk to my sister about it anymore cos I told her about getting attached and she made me feel like a complete idiot for being like that. Idk if it was because I was on MDMA (I know it dissolves boundaries  and you generally have a better connection with other people, the ‘love drug’, very euphoric) but I was drawn to her in a way I have never experienced before (before taking the MDMA), normally I'm sexually attracted to girls like yeah I find her attractive but that's not what drew me too her - idk how to explain it. Like a deeper connection? I don’t want to say like a soul mate, but I’ve never felt a connection like this with a person before? But then again it could be a superficial connection with the drugs. I really have no idea! Any opinions/advice/guidance would seriously be appreciated so much! I have no one to talk to about this. I got about a 1/3 way through the story with my psychologist in todays session  and it’s just eating me up inside! I want to get out of this mental rut! Thank you in advance &lt;3\", \"Social isolation for the 4th week and I'm forgetting time. I just realized I've been home with very minor walks to a store outside for 4 weeks. I took a break this semester due to... Well, mental illness I guess. The important thing is that I have stuff to look forward to. I am going to the psychiatrist on the 7th. I haven't told my mom I'm not studying or working yet. Haven't told my friend. I never texted to my previous group I'm taking this break either. I wanted them to know but it'll be awkward now if I text them just to say bye until I join another class next year. It feels weird. It's like the next dark episode of my life has begun. I've never felt this numb before and my sense of time is literally nothing. Each day just passes with nothing. Browsing internet. Computer game before I get self-conscious and anxious. A quick walk to the kitchen before I leave (there are other tenants I avoid), back to my dorm room. I feel like I'm too passive to do anything now.\", 'I feel far out.. And my sleep cycle is fucked. I have nothing to do, not even a job at the moment though I get paid via public support through the school since I\\'m on sick leave for half a year... but despite me using this time to find help from psychiatrists and stuff there\\'s not a lot going on and it\\'s amounted to a lot of waking up, playing a game, browsing the web, then postponing my sleep until 4-5 am and eat a lot of crap to feign enjoyment. My psychiatrist commented that though he understood my issues he did not find me to appear depressed, and it\\'s true. I can still be goofy (although some days I feel like I\\'m going crazy) but really, most days is just me feeling miserable, not talking to *anybody* (I live on my own btw) not going outside and just going through the motions. I have been on sick leave since Janurary. I have not even called my mom to tell her that I\\'m stuck in my apartment. It\\'s strange, because i want to be depressed so I have an excuse for not doing anything. The problem is social phobia which was already terrible a couple of years ago to the point of being debilitating but now? Now, I\\'m so far out I think I\\'ve developed symptoms that are way worse than being anxious around others. I still stay far away from other people I know or just people in the dormitory, which means I never cook in the public kitchen. I just feel stuck and shit, I\\'m wasting my time even venting this because there\\'s so many things I want help with. On the 21st I have my second session with a psychiatrist. He already ruled out Aspergers which makes me ambivalent but I guess that\\'s not the case, but I\\'m afraid he\\'ll just prescribe me some random pills and say \"go figure it out\".

I am 21 and have never held a real relationship or had sex because I get in my head that they won't like me, will reject me, or laugh at me. When I was 18 I got my first girlfriend and she broke up with me after dating for a few months because I really never took the relationship past going on dates and we kissed like twice. After me and my girlfriend broke up I decided to do something about it and I started seeing this girl after we ended up hooking up a few times at some parties and I asked her out but then she said she didn't want to see me again. Since then I have gone on like one or two dates since then. One went well enough that the girl invited me back to her place after some drinks but when I got there I freaked out thinking that she wasn't going to like me and while we were watching netflix on her bed I fell asleep. I was embarrassed and didn't ask her out again and after that I didn't go out with someone for about a year. I transferred colleges back closer to home and started hanging out with one of my old friend's little sister since we both went to the same school. I eventually got feelings for her and when I told her she said she was seeing this guy she was hooking up with. I got super down and felt like she didn't like me at all but we still hung out all the time last summer. Also after getting rejected by I decided to lose a bunch of weight dropping from 210 down to 170 pounds bc I felt self conscious about my weight. While her and this guy she was seeing weren't officially dating we still hung out a bunch one on one. She would come over to drink and then one night I got up enough courage to ask if she wanted to stay the night and she said yes. At this moment I should have thought that she liked me and wanted to be with me but I kept thinking about that time she rejected me. I also kept thinking about how to make a move but I would just get super freaked out about the whole thing because I wasn't sure how to make a move without bringing up my feelings. Yet again I was in bed with a girl I liked but could not do anything about it because the first two relationships I was in ended with my rejection by them. She then started to see that guy and they started to date each other but in February they broke up for a 2nd time. We started to hang out more after they broke up and 2-3 weeks ago we started to go out once or twice a week. We went to a bar and then went to a park later that week. About a week ago I got an invite to come over to her place and we would drink some wine and watched some netflix in her room. She then asked me if I wanted to stay the night and I freaked out again and decided to go back to my place. Since then I have tried to see her again and now she is always busy and I feel as though I fucked something up just because I overthink things. I started seeing a therapist once a month since december and I feel that she's been helping a lot with my personal life outside of relationships but I haven't really discussed anything about my love life with her because i feel embarrassed. I am wondering if there is anyone who has experienced something similar and how they went about to change their mindset.\", \"Go on a date when you have really bad anxiety. Ok so I'm 19. I'm in college but rarely go to classes because I'm too anxious about what people might think about me or my appearance.

We've been talking every two days on the internet and we're going on a date I guess (we met on tinder and he sent me the wink emoji a few times at the end of messages about going to a bar on saturday night) but I often get really nervous when I talk to people I don't really know, especially if that person is a guy.

I have tried it outside before but being around other people basically just counteracts it because of anxiety to talk.

This is basically the definition of just being afraid of fear itself without any real context to it. I was able to feel happy just through meditation and positivity easier than this. It didn\\'t mean I wasn\\'t fucking anxious though, even though a couple of months ago when I was doing that, I thought it was \"normal\" to be anxious when it wasn\\'t.

Over the more than 20 years that I battled social anxiety before finally overcoming it, I developed the concept of “up and out, not down and down and in”. This sounds simple but it was incredibly effective. It was a little reminder I would give myself that I applied specifically to my gaze and body language in order to turn around any situation where I could feel myself becoming very socially anxious and potentially losing control and spiralling into a full-blown anxiety attack or “episode”. Having had SA for most of my life, I developed a very intimate relationship with it and one of the most interesting things I noticed about it, was that it has most power when not faced - either figuratively or literally. I found it was most potent when left to wreak havoc in that space just out of the corner of your eye or mind’s eye. That couple you can kind of see out of the corner of your eye in the coffee shop and can hear laughing, but are too anxious to turn to look at - you just \"know\" they are laughing at you. You start to feel awkward and you become certain they are giggling more at how conspicuously uncomfortable you are becoming. The book you were originally reading, you are now only using as a prop as a place to fix your eyes. You can feel your thoughts starting to race and feel yourself spiralling towards an anxiety attack. You just \"know\" they can see your excruciating awkwardness and your redness and sweating starting to build, and are delighting in it with those shrill laughs. That person you see coming towards you on the pavement. You’ve only taken a quick glance from 30 yards away, but you can just immediately \"tell\" that it’s that person that used to bully you at school. Your heart explodes and you start to feel it pumping in your neck - not just your chest. You feel sick from the adrenaline. Your head drops, your shoulders round over. Pull out your phone and pretend to take a call so you can turn around? Cross the street? Look at the ground, look at the ground, walk as fast as you can. Let’s just get through this. Why the hell does this kind of stuff always happen to me? Any of this sound familiar? In these (perceived) stressful situations your gaze drops submissively downwards, your attention turns inwards to your own racing thoughts and heartbeat, and your body begins to curl up into a defensive ball - shoulders come up to the ears as if to protect yourself from an imminent blow, arms fold across the chest and the head drops. It was at exactly such moments that I would remind myself of “up and out, not down and in”. As I felt my body and thoughts being crushed by the weight of what I believed was happening around me in situations like those above, I would deliberately push back against it. I would bring my head and gaze up, sit upright, take a deep breath and stretch as if I was uncomfortable from sitting too long, push out my chest and turn my awareness outwards. As I stretched, as if yawning, I would take a good look around the room. And when I did, I found something incredible happened... I found that these nightmare-ish scenarios that I thought were unfolding around me existed as mere phantoms in the corner of my eye and mind’s eye - in my physical and mental peripheral vision as it were. When I turned to look at what was really happening it was as if the scales fell from my eyes and I was awoken from a bad dream. Where I imagined terrible demons looming up, there were only pleasant everyday people, going about their lives. The couple in the coffee shop were a pair of young lovers, so into each other and canoodling so much they hadn’t even noticed me, let alone given a f*ck about what I was doing. The guy walking toward me on the pavement wasn’t that guy from school 20 years ago. I had just managed to project my worst fears onto him and make his face morph into someone else. Amy Cuddy has talked at length about the link between posture and mind, and I find that this “making myself big” brings about an immediate change in me mentally. It is effectively a way of striking a “power pose” and this change in physical state brings about a change in the mind and body - even changing hormone levels! It’s as if I am physically throwing off the pressure which I had been allowing to build up on me, which in turn was shrinking my posture down physically into a weaker and more submissive pose. This then becomes a downward spiral as submissive body language feeds into ever more negative thoughts...and on and on. As I look around the room in such instances or face the person I was worried about, I turn myself from a feeling of the passively observed to potent observer. The gaze is a very powerful thing and can be used very effectively in dealing with social anxiety. In the coffee shop example, as I look around, I see normal people doing their own thing - reading books, listening to podcasts, scrolling through their phones - not the rows of judging faces pointing and laughing at me that I had let build up in my mind’s eye. This technique can be used in any anxiety-inducing situation where you have enough space to avoid yourself shrinking down under the weight of your anxious thoughts. Even if speaking in public or another situation where you feel scrutinised and unable to make exaggerated movements there are still changes you can make to bring about the same effect. For example, if speaking in public you can strike a power pose by widening your stance, leaning forward with both hands on the lectern and bringing your chin up. You can also scan the room to engage people individually with eye contact. In this way, the blurry sea of judgemental “audience” “out there”, becomes individuals with their own features and expressions. I also use it a lot on buses, trains and airplanes where I would find walking past rows and rows of seated passengers while I looked for a seat very stressful. But I find this is most effective on the subway, which i historically found a very stressful and anxiety-inducing environment. The more I would be sucked down into looking at my phone or book (which i was only pretending to engage with because I was becoming anxious - and increasingly so the more I believed people were starting to notice how uncomfortable I was) the more my thoughts would race, the redder I would get and the greater the feeling of losing control and spinning into an anxiety attack was.The spell could only be broken by “up and out, not down and down and in” - looking up, posturing up and turning my attention outwards. On subway trains now I spend a lot of the time enjoying the luxury of leisurely looking around the carriages. I try not to stare at anyone as I’m sure there are many people there with their own self-consciousness and anxiety issues that don’t want any unwarranted excessive attention. But I do enjoy the newfound ability to let my gaze roam around, register people’s faces and see that no one is out to get me or laugh at me or judge me. Has anyone discovered this or uses similar techniques to deal with anxiety-inducing situations?', \"I'm 16 and want to get a job, but am too afraid. And my parents invalidate my social anxiety..

Later on, I went out for a cigarette and she was outside and mentioned that she got locked out. I just said, \"Oh.\" and went back inside. After I closed the door, I felt like such a jerk because I should\\'ve said, \"I\\'m sorry, I was in the back.

I've had social anxiety my whole life, but it was actually manageable before I was 11. I was getting bullied so badly at school I refused to go anymore, and my parents took me out of school. They had isolated themselves from anyone. No friends, no family. I would go outside a few times a year. That's how my social anxiety was able to develop into something that feels utterly hopeless. Is it even possible to recover from that? A few years later I developed body dysmorphia, which causes me to feel a constant shame of my appearance on top of the already present anxiety. I can't say a word to strangers, and I turn my head so they can't see my face and see how ugly I am. It's so, so awkward for me and them and makes me seem unfriendly, which is the last thing I am deep down inside. It's so frustrating. To make matters even worse, I seem to be an extrovert, which goes against all logic. Talking to people is what makes me happiest, by far, so I am in constant, unbearable loneliness and always crave company. I've lost nearly all of my friends and seem to be unable to make new ones. Even if I did, I can only meet people online and they'll be hundreds if not thousands of miles away. No one in my family understands me and they all tell me I'm a burden.

I stood there and in my head I said, yeah that would have been the smart thing to do, but I honestly didn't think of it. I told her that I just didn't think of that, but she though I didn't do it because of my anxiety. This is one of those times that i'm 100% sure that I was just an idiot and didn't think of doing that. It just really bothers me when they immediately assume that and try to argue with me about it!\", \"Working with social anxiety.. So, this is incredibly hard for me. I have anxiety that can get really bad in some situations, however a lot of people don't see me as problematic at all - very well versed in every day situations, e.g. talking on the phone, talking to cashiers, etc. It's fake. I revise these conversations and possible outcomes in my head before I talk. If the conversation goes in a way I don't expect, I get skitty and want to escape. A lot of the time I will say something foolish and think about how dumb I am for the rest of the day. I live in the UK with my parents. I'm 20 years old, I don't want to burden my parents my whole life. I claim employment and support allowance, I'm in the work support group but they don't pressure me all that much due to me suffering from this my whole life (dropping out of school at 15 before my GCSEs because of it, completed at home). I really want to move on with my life, it's getting REALLY tiresome and depressing. I was offered an induction at Thorntons as a factory operative, and I want to try it but I'm kind of scared. What if i take the job, but I have a breakdown and can't go back to ESA? I guess what I'm really wondering is if anyone on here can provide any input on their experiences? E.G. What jobs are the most 'get on with it', with the least social interaction. Hell, 1 hour in a public place and I feel like I've ran a marathon -- however by myself I can do just as much work as anybody. I have some hobbies that take up my time, and a few close friends I am very grateful for -- not everybody with SA has supportive people around them. I enjoy working out (at home), running, playing competitive games and programming. Thanks. Appreciate any advice or someone who can share their experiences :).\", 'Some tips that have helped me with eye contact outside. Hi, I wanted to share some things that have helped me with eye contact. This may or may not work for you but it is good to trial and error it just to be sure. I like making some kind of eye contact even if it is awkward. I used to not make any eye contact with anyone outside and when I would come home, I would feel horrible and start to kick myself because of it. I would feel like I was missing out on life and would feel sad. I broke this habit by telling myself before going outside, \" some eye contact, even if it\\'s awkward, is better than no eye contact.\" For girls, I notice that when a cute girl comes into my line of sight I get nervous and shy away. I would look anywhere expect for them. This has been a automatic reaction for awhile, and I would feel like coward afterwards. I manually had to change this behavior. So before going outside I\\'ll tell myself \" Some eye contact with girls, is better than no eye contact.\" Last tip I can give is posture. I imagine my back against a wall when I am walking. I notice that this helps making eye contact easier and I also feel like a boss for some reason haha. I\\'m no pro and I still get nervous but it has got way better than a couple months back, when I didn\\'t make any eye contact. I am 23 years old and this desire to be confident and get girls has made me want to really change these bad habits that I have had for many years. I have a journey that I use for everyday task, and I write down these quotes everyday, so I can remember before going out. Thanks for reading and sorry about my grammar or wording, I always sucked at writing.', 'Some advice?. Hey guys first time posting on this forum. Just about a week ago I went to go apply for a part time at this retail place but I got scared because there were so much people in the store and at the front desk where the till was. I literally entered the shop and went straight back out. Grabbed a bus and went home. I was shook! I usually apply online but I thought it would further my chances if I apply in store. I am going to try again maybe tommorow. Anyone got advice? Im extremely awkward and quiet when talking to people. Im 18, male. I hardly ever go outside and in desperate need of a part time.', 'Crossing streets. I dread crossing streets because there\\'s just so much to consider. If the hand signal is on I feel like everyone in their cars are watching me standing all awkwardly, and it\\'s worse if there are no cars coming but there are other people with me, because I feel like they expect me to jaywalk. If I start to jaywalk and a car suddenly appears then the driver will get mad and everyone at the sidewalk will see me as some idiot who almost got killed for being impatient, even though I wasn\\'t being impatient, I just started crossing because I was afraid of looking awkward in the event that I didn\\'t cross and I could\\'ve because there were no cars. On the other hand... If the walking signal is on that\\'s good and in most cases no problem, but the worst is when you only have like 10 seconds left to cross so I\\'m not sure if I should start crossing since I might not make it in time. And I don\\'t want to run because in 5th grade people said the way I run is funny so literally ever since I never want to run in public lol. And if I don\\'t make it in time everyone in their car will be upset at me and see me as some idiot who doesn\\'t know when to cross the street. But if I decide to wait, then I just look silly because maybe I could\\'ve made it, and in their heads they\\'re all like \"...why didn\\'t that weird guy cross the street lol.\" So what I\\'ve been doing recently is, whenever I\\'m not sure if I should cross or not, I sort of pretend to walk away from the crosswalk and go on my phone pretending to be busy. This way I avoid both people in their cars and other pedestrians. I\\'m still worried that people can tell what I\\'m doing, but it\\'s not as bad as the other scenarios. Or of course, sometimes I just avoid the crosswalk altogether if there\\'s a bridge or something nearby. I just find it very frustrating that something as simple as crossing the street is this huge obstacle for me. I\\'m terrified of something going wrong and my poor judgment when I\\'m anxious. Anyways, wonder if others can relate to this :0 just wanted to vent and share.', 'I had a weird interaction with an old friend and i need advice, its giving me terrible anxiety worse than ive had in a long time. So im 20. I was catching up with an old friend from high school. We lost touch back in high school but we still live nearby. And we reconnected the other day. He wanted to hang out. I was hanging out with another friend (19 year old) and i was like \"sure, come hang with us\" and he came over. As soon as he got there, he was like \"you\\'re still hanging out with high school kids?\" like he was attacking me or something. we all hung out for a while and it was fine, although he didnt say much. He was very quiet the whole time. He was heading home around midnight after hanging for a couple hours. I was like \"alright, drive safe\" and he was like \"two whole years and thats it?\" My social anxiety went through the roof when he said that. I was already stressed out about him not approving of a lifetime friend of mine, and at this point I felt like he was attacking me. So i came outside to the car with him to say goodbye in private, and I asked him if everything was okay. He said \"why are you still hanging out with high school kids, man?\" I told him my friend\\'s not even still in high school, and he said \"might as well be.\" in a very disapproving, almost angry tone of voice. I\\'m bad at understanding social cues and stuff, and I dont understand why he was so bothered by it. I told him that me and my friend had been friends since elementary school, and I wasn\\'t gonna quit hanging out with him cause he looks young. (he has crohns disease which delayed his puberty so he looks maybe closer to 17, but he\\'s only half a year younger than me, and 8 months younger than him). Anyways, he dropped it after that. I thought he was about to head out, but he ended up staying and we chatted by his car for 30 min to an hour. He started talking about his job, a recent fight with his girlfriend, and about how he really misses a mutual friend of ours from high school. He opened up a lot, and it was surprising considering how he was acting beforehand. The night ended well, but I was left with a bad feeling in my gut and was super anxious. What should I do about the situation? I have terrible social skills and terrible social anxiety. I dont even know how to interpret it. I\\'m stressed as fuck and I cant stop thinking about it. It\\'s making me feel sick and I cant eat, and i had trouble sleeping last night because i was up all night stressed out.', 'Anyone else not like eating in front of people ?. I’m all right with family and close friends but not people I don’t know well. I just left college to go buy some lunch and when I got back I literally just stood outside the door listening to everyone in my class chatting, there’s like 8 of us and everyone else is really friendly with each other but no one really talks to me and I wouldn’t even know how to start a conversation even if I could. Anyway I stood there thinking about how uncomfortable it would be just sitting there eating in front of them so I decided to leave, got half way down the corridor and turned back, got to the door again but panicked so now I’m eating outside in the wet because it’s been raining all morning.', \"I went out alone last night, this is my report. I never knew it was this fucking hard to go out alone, lol. As soon as I hopped on the bus to go downtown I felt like I was on my way to Hell. But I had promised myself to stay outside and be social for atleast 3 hours. As soon as I came to the bar I felt intense anxiety. People sat around their tables, talking actively and having fun and I felt like a proper dickhead joining them uninvited and talking nervously. So, so, so many awkward encounters, cold approaches, trying to bum cigarettes, half-assedly asking for directions, getting made fun of by chads and even bouncers. I walked aimlessly on the steets from bar to bar, socializing as much as I could. My psyche was breaking down. Girls were super uncomfortable around me because I was nervous and boring. Around midnight I said fuck it and gave up. I walked to an E-sports bar and sat down there with a group of people. They were nice and welcoming and we talked about video games. They were boring though and I just sighed out eventually. They started ignoring me completely and just chatted with each other about boring shit. A guy that sat with his friends at another table smiled at me as he saw me sit alone. He waved to me and shouted ''Come over here man!''. This was the turning point of the night for me. I talked for soo long with this guy about a game called PLAYER UNKNOWN BATTLEGROUNDS and he taught me so much. Soon we started talking about getting girls, improving game and working out and we both became super excited to finally have found likeminded people. He said I was one brave motherfucker for going out alone and he said he wants to be my friend. We agreed to go out the next day and try to get girls. I added him on steam and rode the bus home. Now, waking up, he's messaging me on steam and we're making plans to go out today. Together. I am so excited and happy. My resilience paid off. Never ever give up. I know it's extremly fucking hard to work up the courage to go out alone and not chicken out after your first awkward social encounter, but please, for yourself and for me, don't give up. The universe will reward you for your courage and good things will happen you. Fuck me, what a long post. Very confusing I'm sure. I'm hungover so I can barely type. Oh well, I hope someone finds this interesting and helpful to read.\", 'success story - not a boast. hi i am a 24 yo male and have had social anxiety for a while now.. about 4 years. I have never had a gf, i am a virgin and i havent been kissed.. im not an ugly fucker, but no ryan gosling either. yesterday i went out rather reluctantly with a uni friend as i had just finished my degree.. it was a uni event anyways i planned on just drinking in my sorrows and such which i did, but i was finding it kinda nice. My friend was there with her bf and her other friend. We got along rather well. Sure enough the 4 of us got bored and went to do our own thing. Her friend lets call her \"eve\" (lol) and i danced and drank a bit. I kinda broke out into salsa or similar and started holding hands with her damcing around. I dunno what was going through my mind (other than alco) but i did find her cute (she was indian or similar) we grinded a little as well and kept saying stupid things to one another about the place and i kept making sure not to charge across her boundaries but also break the touch barrier.. we held hands while dancing heaps. my two other friends left early and i took this chance to ask her to go for a walk.. sure enough we did and we ate shitty fast food on the way back to where ahe was staying.. at the top of the stairs i had to give her back her shoes (i was carrying them because they hurt her feet) i asked her if she wanted her shoes back and she said \"maybe, is that what you want?\" i said \"idk maybe its not\" she said \"maybe you want something else\" i said \"maybe i do\" we smiled and she leant in for a kiss snd i met it. We made out for a little bit and i said \"thats more like it\" we did it again and i hugged her around her lower back.. i told her that was my first kiss and she was kinda shocked.. then she told me hers and how it was weird. We kept talking and we kissed again. Then we said we have to go on a date. Then added each other on fb. I left with her and then we said goodbye. Whatever happens now doesnt bother me. I feel kinda concrete when it happened.. like i wasnt passionate enough. She was into it but i kinda wasnt because of my anxiety.. but i managed to wing the whole episode. We seemingly had a bit in common (not much of a social life) and kinda pissed with the world. We played 20 questions while eating shitty fast food and i asked if anyone ever complimented her on her eyes. They were dark brown and matched her skin. She was so cute. All this happened in a 5 hour period. I guess we clicked and we also related on similar things. I still see her eyes looking up at me while we were dancing. She smaller than me and i liked it. Im telling you this to prove that all of us can do it. I was over feeling alone but i hated it still. Im not here to boast because im not a cunt. Im here to give you a sense of hope because it is certainly possible. Never underestimate your chances. I have now joined the ranks of the users of this subreddit who have had success. Its possible. Just wait for it.', \"Practising conversation on drunk people??. Okay, I tried this tonight. Literally just got in from it. I went out without a drink in my system (unfortunately I decided wayyy too late I was going to do this) and so couldn't actually get in anywhere (after 2am the clubs open generally don't let you in for free, so I was stuck OUTSIDE them). I just walked the streets outside and would spark up conversations with people. It seemed like great practice and allowed me to test myself. There's something about drunk people that makes me wayy less anxious. Probably because a) they won't remember and b) I'll be nowhere near the weirdest thing to happen to them that night, so will just be insignificant. Anyone else do this? OR think it is a good idea? I only got to converse with a few people because I was still a bit hesitant (and turned out helping some passed out guy who wasn't breathing for a bit)... Opinions..?\", 'Cold, introverted IRL but \"easy to talk to\" online. I\\'ve struggled with social anxiety as long as I can remember. I never had many friends at school and even though I played sports for ten years (baseball) I never really got a \\'social network\\' going. Ever since college I\\'ve more or less lived my life online. I probably spend 6-10 hours most days on the computer. It\\'s where I get most of my social needs met, as far as that\\'s possible. I feel like two different people living in the same body. One person is the face I show in public, quiet, passive, and unassuming. The other is what I show online, where I tend to be extremely outgoing/silly and make a lot of jokes. IRL I\\'m too nervous to be who I am -- a fun loving extrovert -- because of my anxiety. Over the years I\\'ve managed quite the collection of bad memories at dozens of social events where I have hid, snapped, or run away. The most recent example was a all staff meeting at work where I first went to the bathroom to avoid introducing myself to my coworkers and a half hour later had a row with one of them because of a misunderstanding. I left the meeting and didn\\'t come back (ended up pacing outside for two hours before I calmed down enough to go inside). The internet is the only outlet I have to really express myself because most of the social pressures in day to day interaction don\\'t exist.

I (f/20) am in a psychiatry right now (since 3 weeks), i got a bit more comfortable around a big amount of people, i don't get nervous anymore running through the hospital (its a very fucking big hospital with hundreds of people all day). I always prefered to be alone, i accepted the fact that i LOVE to be alone. Sometimes when i'm alone i feel lonely, but when i go outside again i realize how fucked up this society is, i am more comfortable when i'm alone, i don't need anyone, i was always isolated, introverted, and without friends my entire life, why should i change that? I can't miss anything i've never had, and just started to accepting it and get happy with it and done. The only thing the psychiatry helped me is to not to overthink so much like ''what random strangers might think about me when i walk past them'' so yeah, that's 1 good thing. But the other thing pisses me of so much.... i. can't. fucking. talk. I never talked to my parents, i never talked to anyone, seven hells, even my psychiatrist knows more about me in 3 meetings than my parents for 20 years and i'm barely able to talk to her, 'cause i don't know what the fuck to say, i have nothing to say, my interests are space, history, really old stuff no one knows shit about or doesn't care. Other than that i play games the entire day or watch movies... But nothing interesting to talk about with others at my age... Soo. I can't hold a conversation at all, i can't start it and things get weird pretty quickly. I guess that's what most of us get through. So how do i break it? My only motivation? lmao, i am pathetic. My only motivation to change is because of another girl that works at the psychiatry as a student and i, well, how can i say this? seems like i got a fucking crush on her and it makes things WORSE. I've been trying to act normal around her which works surprisingly good, my self control is at 100%. But i still can't talk, i just want to talk to her, she is so fucking nice and i don't want to mess it up...Things got worse, now i don't want to be alone anymore AND don't want to be around people, this shit fucked everything up even more for me... I get so fucking nervous when i try to talk...I always say to myself ''why can't you be normal? none of this shit matters, if you don't talk to her you will never see her again after you get out of the psychiatry so just fucking talk, next time you see her say ''hello'' and be done with it'' i go back immediatly to do it but then i freeze up the moment i see her and can't open my mouth because the fear is literally eating up my ass. What the fuck am i supposed to do?

Ok, so, I'm a 24 year old man who has never had a girlfriend, been on a date, kissed, or even held hands. And it makes me severely depressed. All I want out of life is a soulmate. Everything else to me is secondary than to have someone to love and be loved in return. I'm a quiet person, I don't go out clubbing and drinking, I quite frankly hate that, the problem being I don't know where to meet girls my age. I know even if I went out drinking/ clubbing I would not find the kind of person I would want to be around at all. I know what kind of person I like... quiet, like me, someone I can talk and laugh about anything with and just be myself and they can be themselves. Up until the last year I didn't really think about this, I wasn't an adult, I was more bothered with messing around with my friends and doing my uni work. But now I feel really empty, I know I just want a woman in my life. I've missed 2 opportunities where the right person came along in the last 6 years to be with girls I liked because I didn't realize I liked them until it was too late and they had already found other guys (like soulmates) I know I was immature and didn't realise what was happening. Nowadays I know that wouldn't happen but both of these people are long gone from my life. Over the last year I've been constantly using tinder, plenty of fish and okcupid, but no results at all. Tinder is the least successful as I have only had 2 matches, ever, it's 90% not my type of women anyway. PoF and okcupid have more of the right types of people on there. But the thing is, I'll always message first, 7 times out of 10 I will get no reply, and mostly if I do they stop replying in like 5 or 10 messages, and I've only had 3 connections that I thought were going somewhere but all 3 got to the point of me asking them on a date and then going through them just saying they weren't ready even though I'd only suggest going for a walk in town or a cup of coffee and a chat. I don't know what I'm doing wrong there. I don't know where to meet the right kind of people in real life. I'm a freelance animator and that isn't very social at all. And my other job is part time in a pound shop in my home town (I still live with my parents simply because I cannot afford to move out at all) and I don't really meet people at work. Besides if I saw a girl I liked at work I would not know what to say. I'm terrified of looking/sounding creepy so what happens is I just can't even make eye contact let alone say anything. I'm not ugly, I'm not an asshole, I am nice to everyone I meet unless they are unpleasant to me in the first place. I don't know what to do. (If this seems ranty and rambly it's because it is, I'm just sitting here crying typing this.)\", \"Stupidest thing I've done in a while: didn't know how to tell someone I came with a car so I walked half an hour home and then immediately half an hour back to get my car. I usually walk to college. It's 30 minutes of brisk walking, kinda far but not really. Can't use public transport because there's no direct routes, and the closest bus route actually takes longer than just walking. But a bit too close to drive to everyday. I don't mind, I like walking anyway. This time, however, I was out of town before class so I came with a car. After class these two dudes started asking me some questions about the class and they said they are heading in my direction. I thought they were just going to take the bus, so I was like okay whatever, they're just going to go the other way after that corner, it's just a two minute detour. But no, what they actually meant was that they were going somewhere near where I live so they were going to walk with me. After I realized this I didn't know what to say so I just thought fuck it, walked all the way home, pretty much to my doorstep, (actually took far longer than it usually takes me, because they walk very slow and I couldn't use my shortcuts). Then I looked around to see if they're gone, then I walked allllllll the way back to school and got the car, then drove back home again. Like what the hell, seriously. Worst part is, these two guys are the only two people I dislike in my entire class. They talk shit about everyone, just extremely unpleasant hateful individuals. They probably think I'm like them because I don't talk to other people much. I don't know how to let them know I'm not. Whenever they invite me somewhere I tell them no, but they still persist.

I\\'ve had two girls from plenty of fish talk to me for a week, and got to the point of asking them out on a date (literally just going for a cup of coffee and a chat) and they both dodged the question and then stopped replying. 90% of the time on PoF, ok Cupid, and blendr they never reply. I\\'ll just send a first message with just a greeting and asking them how their week is going... I hate talking through just messages because I can\\'t get my intent across, and I can\\'t interpret the intent of others. I want to meet girls face to face. But I absolutely hate drinking, bars and clubs and \"going out\" I like video games, movies, art and nature. I don\\'t know where to meet girls my age who I\\'d like. One other thing I should mention is I\\'m exclusively attracted to bigger girls, I don\\'t know why, it\\'s always been that way, and I get anxious that a girl might find that weird and think I\\'m some sort of sexual freak. I feel like I\\'m running out of time. It fills me with absolute despair at this point, I can\\'t put into words how much I want to have a partner, I have so much love to give but noone to love.

I have been living with social anxiety and depression for six years now, it started when I hit puberty. Sadly, I am about as stubborn as anxious, which has lead me to some pretty dark times. There have been worse moments in those six years, like waking up to police kicking down your door to bring you to a psych ward, my mum not letting me inside the house for 2 days to make me tough and my anxiety disappear, thanks for that. Or when I was being put in a home for disfunctional children, but ran away again and again, hiding in a forest and shit. I am living in my small little apartment and haven't interacted with anyone for four months. Except my mum, who is caring for me, which is honestly very nice of her. But you can tell she is about to cut off contact. Anyway, today workers had to come to fix something in my apartment, the first time someone besides me or mum was about to enter my apartment. I couldn't handle it. I didn't sleep yesterday night because I was feeling so on edge and didn't eat today yet because of the stomach ache my anxiety is causing. I asked my mum to come and be here when they come so I could get away. You could see the moment she realized I am still an anxious wreck, if not way worse. She refused to drive me to her place, so I had no place to stay at. So I grabbed her car keys and got in her car. What I am trying to say is that I basically sat in a car for four solid hours today, because the workers didn't say exactly when they'd come. And guess what. Last minute they called my mum letting her know they couldnt make it today and they'd come back in the next few days. I am pathetic. Plus my mum screamed at me because she doesn't understand. Kind of bummed my suicide attempt last week didn't work, good thing nobody noticed tho.\", 'Stepped far outside my comfort zone today by stepping into a classroom setting for the first time in my life.. My local community college had a preview day today. As part of a New Years resolution, I decided I was going to start saying yes to events instead of being cozied up at home all the time. I should note that I’ve been homeschooled through K-12, hence never having walked in a classroom. I won’t lie, I was really nervous leading up to, and partly during the event. I played some indie folk music on the way to try to soothe my nerves. As soon as I pull my car over the hill with the intersection, I witnessed just what I’d be getting myself into. Cars were everywhere. It was a real turn out. There were over 200 people in attendance. I find a parking spot at another building, and I’m just thinking of home. Home where I don’t have to worry about sounding stupid or accidentally having a social faux pas. I push out my chest and walk towards the line. I wasn’t expecting a line. So I mozy on to the back of the line, occasionally looking at my phone so I would blend in with most of the high school kids that were there (I’m 19 with a full beard who is out of the loop on current technology). I couldn’t get a WiFi connection, so I was just switching between settings and the browser the whole time, hopefully looking like I was doing something. The line crawls, and I’m just switching between looking up and at my phone. I make it to the walk up registration, and tell them my name and what not. It seems like it went ok. I walked up and just found the quickest seat I could so I wouldn’t have to be seen walking up by everyone. I sit down and immediately this dude asks if I play vidya games. So I tell him I play fortnite. He starts asking if I watch this particular twitch streamer, I say no. The conversation kind of fizzles out after. Wondering if I seemed boring? Moments later I hear him say to one of his friends “you want to get drunk later?”. At that moment I’m having a little bit of a culture shock. I’ve never drank alcohol. Does everyone booze in HS? I felt kind of uncomfortable. Finally the presentation begins. It’s pretty basic, and I could have got more information from the website. There is a point during the presentation where they play this website quiz game from the school. I can’t partake because my WiFi won’t work, so I just watch the results. I would have got most of them wrong if I tried. Yikes. I was taking notes, but not paying attention to the right stuff evidently. So after that, the whole room is being split off into tour groups. I am paying full attention because I don’t want to screw up and go off with the wrong group. Thankfully I do get the right one. At this point I’m standing alone with a bunch of strangers. Most are with someone else. The tour seems to go fine, there were these three really obnoxious teenagers who were fucking off for the most part though. They didn’t bother me thankfully. Our tour ends and it’s on to the last event (which I wasn’t aware of until later.) Its basically a few different stands promoting different fields of study and social events (almost none of which pertained to my major of choice or my personal interests.) I talk to a few of them anyways. I won’t lie, it was really awkward. I kept tripping over my words, speaking in broken English, and my mind went completely blank a few times while in the middle of conversations. I honestly wonder if this hurt my chances of being enrolled. I didn’t have many good questions either. Afterwards I sat at a table and fidgeted on my phone, then I realized it was for the most part over, and a wave of calm came over me. I realized I could leave! Since I didn’t have anyone to talk to, what was the point of staying any longer? So I walked a long walk back to my car and headed home. That was it. Only part worth it was touring the campus honestly. Well it wasn’t a perfect attempt at integrating into society, but it’s progress nonetheless. I’m proud that I did this instead of wondering what it would have been like at home. It was awkward and I didn’t connect with anyone. I’m afraid more will follow when I do (eventually) enroll there. I just thought I’d share his with anyone of you who is afraid of getting out of the house and in public. I still feel like an out of touch geriatric alien, but hopefully I made some progress. **TL;DR** Went to a preview day at my local community college. Walked into a classroom setting for the first time ever. Had awkward encounters with recruiters and faculty. Glad I went anyways.', ' Did anyone else grow up isolated?. Growing up I wasn\\'t allowed to watch movies rated higher than PG or play games rated higher than E. I remember that for movie days in class, my parents often wouldn\\'t sign my permission slip. I also wasn\\'t supposed to watch \"bad tv\" like Spongebob or the Simpsons. I wasn\\'t allowed to have a cell phone until like eighth grade, and even then it was a shitty flip phone in the early years of smart phones. Coincidentally we also didn\\'t live around any other kids; the school bus didn\\'t even come to our house. My parents would still force me to go outside sometimes when they felt I had spent too much time on the computer (no internet of course), even though there was literally nothing for me to do except maybe throw a frisbee at my brother who is four years younger than me (a huge age difference for a preteen). My parents weren\\'t narcissistic or religious nuts, maybe a bit overprotective, but I feel like the rules they had for me prevented me from making friends in my early development, which is of course a very important time to make friends. And what\\'s worse is I think they relaxed their rules for my younger sibling, and now he\\'s in high school and from what I\\'ve heard he has lots of friends and does school sports and other extracurriculars. I would not be surprised if he has his first relationship before me (maybe I shouldn\\'t think this way, but the day that happens is the day that whatever meager self worth I have will be extinguished).

She also mentioned earlier that she liked hiking. Would it be weird to ask her to go hiking since we would be alone and she doesn't really know me? I'm so excited!! \", 'Has anyone else experienced this or something like it?. This is gonna be a very long and personal post to an extent with some background detail for clarity. Hopefully someone will read through and offer some advice or likeness. Okay, so I have been someone who suffers from social anxiety since I was about 8. Before that I was actually very outgoing and was social at my preschool/first grade/second grade. Many things contributed to my social anxiety and thus my life long battle of depression. The first notable thing was my teachers bullying me for having ADHD and telling me I was too disruptive. The second notable thing was my best friend in second grade ended up ignoring me because the popular girl in the class disliked me as I was very active and bubbly. So, that\\'s some backstory, and ever since then I have been an internet recluse. Everytime I tried to make friends they used me and then bullied me verbally and mentally until at 13 I quit going to school and outside completely. Internet gaming, specifically MMOs is all I\\'ve had since. Fast forward, I am now nearing 22. I go to college, have a job, and a boyfriend of nearly 5 years. Everything on that aspect is fine (or better than expected for now) but...I fucked myself over socially. When I was 16 I made a friend group despite my social anxiety. The internet is easier to socialize on for me, even though I still can\\'t order a pizza over the phone or make a Dr. Appointment irl. I\\'ve had these friends since 16 for a very stable period, but last year I had a complete social anxiety attack and went haywire. I removed everyone, blocked them, and vanished for 2 months. I tried to come back and explain what happened, but no one was having it. One friend who was very close, even responded \"lol good\" when she heard I was struggling. I tried to reach out people to ask why I was being treated this way and they would get mad at each other for telling me something and then I got backlash for trying to reconnect and put the pieces of my social life back together. This has been extremely debilitating for me and I have relapsed to my pre-social ways. I apologized and told them I\\'d stop bothering them, to which they never responded to except that they didn\\'t need the drama. What bothers me most is that to make these friends, I put myself out there and listened to when THEY were upset. I specifically remember two of them were genuinely suicidal and I talked them through their troubles. One of them said she won\\'t speak to me because I am only trying to talk to her because no one else will and I need someone. Well....yeah. Is this not what normal friends do? Anyways, I apologized to them all and removed them because I was only a bother and annoying. I keep having small breakdowns and it\\'s leaking out in my relationship and work. Today at work the assistant manager seen me act very atypical and asked me if I was okay to which I kind of laughed in a hollow tone and said no and walked away. Everyone at work noticed and I started having an anxiety attack mid rush (I work at a pizza place so it can get work heavy on weekends). What do I do now? Has anyone else experienced this and has found a way to cope or just experienced this in general? I want to make new friends...but I just feel like a teen again and like everyone hates me. TL;DR: I was social for awhile, had an anxiety attack, got isolated, and now I have nothing. Anyone relate?', ' talked to a cute person today! is it weird to smile?. was on a walk and talked to a cute guy walking his dog.

Firstly, I made a post [here](about being nervous to contact and old friend. I pushed myself to do it and it went really well. She was super friendly and we've been chatting back and forth for the past few days!! I was also [anxious](about collecting donations for an organisation I volunteer for. I just got back from doing it, and I'm pretty proud of myself. We were outside a supermarket so there were lots of people coming and going. We managed to collect a good amount of money, and I managed to make small talk and thank everyone who donated. It sounds small but this was a huge step for me.

I lasted less than 30 min. I'm 21/male but my sister, who's just graduated, invited me to go with her to her friend's graduation party because she felt bad that I'm always alone. I stood around awkwardly for a while eating caramel popcorn and then spent like 10 minutes staring at myself in the bathroom mirror lol. Following this was a series of short, awkward exchanges and a sudden wave of sadness. I didn't last but another 10 minutes snacking on popcorn till I ended up outside sitting behind my sister's car browsing reddit on my phone..

I want to get a part-time job to start earning money and buy my own things and start contributing to my college expenses. However, I struggle with anxiety. I lived a very sheltered life. I never really had any friends and I spent a lot of time in my house. I didn't go outside too much. I used to get bullied a lot as well. My father growing up was very critical, harsh, and judgmental of every thing I did. He would always give me a hard time on being so shy. When I'm in public or around strangers, I get nervous. The only place where I feel most comfortable is my house. It's so irritating because this anxiety is holding me back from getting a job. I want to get a job in customer service, because I think it could help bring me out of my shell. But I get nervous of the thought of having to interact with strangers. What if I get nervous talking to a customer and they can tell, and they think I'm weird? What if I'm awkward interacting with them? The thought of my coworkers, customers, and manager observing me and judging me is difficult. How am I going to get through the interview? What if I can't think of an answer to a question? I'm afraid I will make a lot of mistakes at work and make a fool of myself. I'm also a huge people-pleaser. What if my manager won't like me? What if my coworkers won't like me? What if a customer gives me a hard time? I hate that I let my anxiety build up to this point. I always had it but it was never this bad. I need a job because I need money.

However I can understand why she wouldn't have even chosen me, I don't even have a job because I'm deathly afraid of answers calls. I also don't have anyone I can talk to about my anxiety, and being honest (you can laugh if you want) I have an imaginary friend that I talk with often.

It stemmed from when my 8th grade history teacher didn\\'t like me and pretty much ignored me the entire school year. He acknowledged all of his students except for me.

I guess I am looking for some help. I have trouble with conversating with people. I am 14 and male. Just recently I have been trying to invite myself into a group of a few children, they seem to welcome me everytime. I say hello, sit/stand in the group but I dont say anything else. Whilst they are talking away, I cant think of a word to say, i struggle to even keep track of what people are talking about. I find speaking with adults hard, but a lot easier. I may sound stuck up saying this, but i find almost all children my age immature. Most of their jokes I don't find funny, and I am not interested in their childish conversations. Most of them are around 16 years old. When I tell most people I am 14, they are very suprised. Ive had a few people over the internet guess im 19-25 by the sound of my voice. When someone asks me in person, they ussually thought i was around 17. I almost find it to be a chore to even join a group of kids my age. Im very interested in history, and science, I could talk anout black holes all day! Unfortunately those sort of things dont seem to interest them, nor do they even seem to understand it. I havent had an actual freind since the 3rd grade, I'm about to be in 10'th. It sounds like an exaggeration, but most days I am stuck in the shitty apartment doing nothing but watching youtube all day. My parents would rather not let me outside because (boy your gonna get raped and they gonna chop ur dic off). Yea, im sure... I have tried reaching out to my parents for help, but they tell me its fine. LIVING LIKE SHIT WITHOUT EVER TALKING TO SOMEBODY OR DOING ANYTHING AT ALL IS NOT FINE! When i say I can't do anything, im being honest, i honestly spend the entire day watching youtube because i can't do anything else. I just need help learning to talk to people. I see some of them griping about how they wanted to kill themselves because they had to spend a whole day inside the house, boo hoo little bitch, try spending every day like that. I can't relate to any children my age. I dont play any video games or watch any shows, and I don't use social media, as I have no reason to.

When my mom picked me up from the two day orientation I was tired and irritable argued with her about religion. Yeah I don’t like Christianity that much, but I’m usually respectful and not a complete dick like I was. She ended up crying, not from the arguing but when we were arguing about me getting better and I was saying how I know what I need right now more than her. Which is true.

When I’m out with family I order off the kids menu because that’s all I like, unless there is just chips on the adult menu. That’s kind of embarrassing on a date. I don’t like the cinema or any time of play/concert etc. I find it too loud and I hate the fact I can’t just get up and do what I want at anytime or leave. Things like concerts are also out of the question because they’re also too over whelming for me and I don’t like being around drunk people. So obviously not drinking and also being 19 is a problem because that’s all teenagers seem to do. I don’t like pubs or bars or parties. I also feel embarrassed when I say I don’t drink. Honestly my idea of a perfect date is Netflix at home or going for a walk, or even something like going to an arcade. Thing is no one my age wants to do that stuff and I feel embarrassed to say I don’t like it. That’s even if I get comfortable enough to want to go on a date anyway.

Dont have gf because I feadr I will be judged by my friends if they dont find her beutiful (I know it is stupid but I think like that) and if I tell my parents they will start asking me questions that I would not feel very confortable about. Family history of generalised anxiety and my grandpa has social anxiety.', 'If people stopped filming everything everywhere, a lot of us would feel more comfortable going outside. Is this bothering anyone else? I literally can\\'t go anywhere and not have someone film us or take pictures. For example when we are eating at the university campus with some classmates, some of them are filming every 3rd or so conversation trying to get material for their instagram stories. They also keep taking pictures of their food and randomly scream in excitement while filming, even if there is nothing exciting happening. Also pointing the camera at me because apparently it\\'s \"fun filming the shy dude\" is making me mad. I took a walk at the park with some friends the other day and almost every group we met along the way was filming themselves (or taking pics) and consequently filming people passing by (us). Is this actually a common thing? Am I whining for no reason? Am I just stuck with annoying people? I just don\\'t want to be filmed... tl;dr: people keep filming every social situation and it\\'s annoying', \"Yesterday I went on my first date. WARNING!!this post got a little too long and my english is not perfect! Yesterday I went on my first date!! So I met this girl on a dating site and we texted for 3 days.She always relied me and told me she enjoys my company and miss me when we dont text..While texting she always send me pics of her and hart emojis.She told me she had unsuccessful relationships with guys a and asked me am I afraid to be in relationship.I said im not afraid.While texting yesterday she asked me if im tired to go out and I told her im not but it's too late (22pm).She told me she is sad and wants to meet me. we exchanged numbers and pics proving we are real.I thought is weird to meet at this time but i agreed and she took the last bus to my neighborhood at 23pm .I went to the bus stop to wait for her.The bus came and it was really her.We shaked hands and said hi.I asked her what she wants to do and she told me to hang out at the park in my neighbourhood.I told her I feel cold and need to change my shoes and we went to my apartment.She came inside the building and waited for me to get ready.We went to the park and we talked for 1 hour.She told me she don't want a boyfriend unless she is truly sure its the right guy,since she previously had alot of breakups.I felt really stupid because I thought we are going to hug atleast and even make out .Time passed ,we said bye and she left.She walked 40 mins at 0.30am to her home since there is no bus at this time.She called me when she got home.We texted a little and went to sleep.Today she didn't texted me till 17 pm!!And she is more cold and sends short text.I told her I missed her and she didnt said anything.What I fucked up this time???i thought she likes me,but after we met she is uninterested. Now we barely talk.I feel like shit now.She probably didnt liked me in person cuz she was fine when I told her I was shy.What makes me even more sad is that she was under average and chubby and even a girl like her didnt like me.Give me some advice guys I dont want to die alone :-(\", \"I have realised that it is not just shyness and introversion. I need help but Im too afraid to ask for it. Im 16, male, suffer from GAD since I was 3 yo got diagnosed with it when I was 8 or 9. This past summer I saw many changes with my behaviour and thought they were normal, because of puberty and such. Now Im sure it isnt just puberty. Today I went to the store to buy a new pair of earbuds, mine broke and listening to music helps with my anxiety. I was on foot and during the 7 mimute walk to the store I was starting to get sweaty, I was thinking what to say to shop assistant and I was afraid of someone recognising me and I had to make a small talk with them. I get to the store, a big one inside a mall. I get there and the first thing I see were the earbuds, but they werent those that I wanted, searched and couldnt find the earbuds that I wanted, I wanted to get as quickly as possible so I grabbed one of those and headed towards the counter to buy them. The shop assistant was talking to 2 women and I was afraid of interrupting them, I give the earbuds to another shop assistant that was next to the other shop assistant that was talking to the women. He was doing something else but I put the earbuds on top of the counter without saying anything, the guy saw that I wanted to buy the ear buds and gave them to the lady that was talking to the women. The woman was slowlying writting on the keyboard with 2 fingers and talking to the women, during this, I was sweating and shaking, and I was looking at the store, I saw the earbuds that I wanted on my right and I had missed them when I was first looking for the earbuds. I take one of the earbuds and placed them on top of the counter, the shop assistant didnt see the earbuds that I wanted on top of the counter, I had to talk to the shop assistant that I wanted to change the product, few words, was quick and quiet while shaking and sweating. She did what she had to do and I took the money out of my wallet shaking to give the lady. I put them in my backpack and walk, almost running to home thinking that I was way too akward and that they saw me shaking and sweating, got home and started writting this. I go the shrink about my GAD but never mentioned my anxiety while on these situations. Im too afraid, my parents judge me for not hangging out much with my peers, they compare me to them when they were my age and I sometimes get grounded because they think that I am additcted to my pc and phone, which I am not, and that addiction is making me hang out less with my friends. My shrink knows my parents really well, she was my dad's shrink for when he had depression, it was on that time that I was diagnosed with GAD. At the end of each session my shrink talks to my dad or my mom about the session amd Im afraid my parents will judge me after the session, at home. What should I do? Im pretty confident Im socially anxious, my best friend is the only one that knows about this.\", \"I dont undestand why i have it.. My childhood was the exact opposite to this until my teens and it completely changed i dont understand. I was brought up in a pub in England a social place. i was apart of soccer teams, i would always go outside and i wouldn't care. could say its because i was a kid but i felt like that until i was about 13. but suddenly now at 17 im scared to go to the store so confused? ive encumbered some bad habits such as gaming a lot,weight gain a bit but i dont know if i feel thats it.\", 'The whole quiet = school shooter stereotype. I was listening to music in class today, and the exact moment I pause my music to listen, I hear \"school shooter\", and there\\'s a 99% chance those 2 words were directed at me, as I am the only person (lucky) enough to have a table to myself, and I\\'ve had these \"jokes\" directed to me an uncountable amount of times before. One that always sticks with me was a time in science class. I was sitting and these idiots behind me decide to start throwing things somewhere, and of course I get hit. The whole room goes dead quiet and the person who threw it said \"I thought that was the end of the school.\".. Que laughing. I just don\\'t understand it. Is it because I wear a black hoodie? Because I want to stay warm in this freezing school, that makes me a school shooter? Is it because I\\'m quiet? Because I literally cannot socialize because my stupid brain runs through every single horrible possibility of what could happen? Does that make me a school shooter? Because I want so so so badly to have a friend or people to talk to me like a person, but my feelings and brain won\\'t allow it? It almost makes me cry every time, and I know that makes me feel like a baby. All through school, ice had things like paper, clay, and even shards of glass thrown at me. I\\'ve been physically beat up on the side of the road walking home as people in their cars watched. But its only the school shooter statement that really hurts me. I never wanted to hurt people. I hate having people scared of me. If they\\'re scared of me, they\\'ll never talk to me. I hate this.', 'Anxiety attack during a party and had to leave. I’m currently sitting outside near my car, waiting to sober up, because I thought I could enjoy a party if I drank a lot. Nope. I really don’t understand the appeal of not knowing anyone in a crowd of 30 people, trying to make small talk and dance around. I really don’t understand it. I can still see the house and I see people dancing in the windows but even though I tried to have fun for over an hour, I just became increasingly more anxious and sweaty and stressed out. It’s so frustrating. I tried going to a party at this house last weekend too; I know the people who live there well enough to hang out in a small group and have a great time but I can’t stand being there during a party. I try to follow the few people I know around but they wander away from me and I get stressed out and that makes it even harder to relax and talk to new people. I wish I hadn’t tried to drink to make myself have fun because I’m gonna have to wait a while before driving home. At least I parked across the street! Last weekend I lasted about 10 minutes and this time I lasted over an hour, and despite feeling socially inadequate and extremely stressed out, I think I can accept that big parties just aren’t good for me right now and I don’t want to waste my time and energy just to feel like this. I do wish that I could fit in an enjoy it but I can’t. I really wish I could have fun and talk to people. I felt lightheaded and terrified the whole time I was in there. Ugh. I just wanted to vent while I wait to sober up. Thanks for reading!', 'Everyone hates me and what I\\'ve learned from it. This is going to be a weird post and hopefully it fits here well. I never thought of this as a social anxiety, but it actually is kind of, correct me if I\\'m wrong I\\'m new to Reddit. I\\'ve been hated. Even since preschool. Not by my family by all means, and people liked members of my family by the way. It seemed like people only outside of my family hated me. Strangers, classmates, coworkers, anyone I came into contact with besides my family hates me. I was always the quiet one and the weird one. I never minded either. I fed off of their hate. Anytime I got bullied I would fight back. Like you know when they say fight or flight? Yea I was the fighter. I would lash out and do exactly what they did to me. Or I would cry and show them exactly how it made me feel right then and there, almost as a joke but filled with rage. I didn\\'t really get embarrassed. I was really good at doing embarrassing things and be okay with it most of the time. I preferred to be alone. I never liked it When people tried to become my friend. Like why are you texting me and calling me? Please leave me alone. For some reason I did actually become friends with the other unliked kid. I would see people snicker at them and see them as weird. Here\\'s a little story: There was one girl in middle school. Her name was Jane. She had long black hair, pale skin and bright hazel eyes. The kids were literally afraid of her and thought she was weird I wasn\\'t afraid of her and I was fascinated in her. I also felt empathy for her. I could relate to her of being unliked. End of short story. Weird part about enjoying being alone is I\\'ve always had a boyfriend since the beginning of high school. The boyfriends were always cool and well liked by others. The boyfriends were all similar in their own ways, we all broke up mutually, calmly and on good terms. The boyfriends all gave me respect, friendship and trust. The cool boys always liked Jane as well and she always had a cool boyfriend too! Other boys thought we were the \"funniest, raddest, coolest, best to be around\" chicks out there. Or so they say. So I guess what I should have said in the beginning of this entire post is, most girls hate me. So truth be told, not everyone hates me. This has been a lie for my whole life. I believed as a small child up until early adulthood is that everyone hated me was far from the truth. One day I had enough. I tried to kill myself. Slit my wrists and wanted to bleed out. Well it didn\\'t work, I didn\\'t die and I should have gotten stitches. So I decided that day I will never try again left with awful scars. I still hated my life and the fact everyone hated me. I fell again in these ideas I created. Sure there was hard proof for people hating me. They hated the way I looked, the way I dressed, my hair. They spread rumors, they prank phone called me, tried to best me up. I had a girl send me a 10 page text message saying I lie about every story I ever told her . The words this girl said to me hurt me deeply. I cried and cried. I worked with her and I had to face her. I was terrified of her and I wondered \"why me\" It was a pattern. Some girls simply just didn\\'t like me. There was nothing I could say or do any differently. You might be thinking, \"there has got to be a reason why people hate me.\" The only thing I can think of to answer that thought, would be that I am totally myself. I don\\'t sugar coat shit. I\\'m honest and I like to share ideas and past expieriances. So here is a little description about me to paint a better picture. I try hard with things I do. I really enjoy practicing different skills and hobbies that strike my interest suddenly such as painting, playing instruments, gymnastics, yoga, hiking, biking, dog training, cooking, singing and more. If something interests me I try it. You could say I\\'m a go getter. At the same time I\\'m laid back, I\\'m quiet and a keep to myself person. Other times I am wacky and weird. I sing and dance to myself, I talk to myself. I do weird things. I make jokes and I laugh at things. I am over the spectrum of things. I am ever changing. I am confused but I am aware. I am always looking around me and thinking people are planning things. I avoid people. Other times I truely care about people. I love people and I love seeing their talents. I want to get to know them and I listen to them. I always see people and notice their intentions. You could say I am observant. But all of this I still enjoy being alone. I guess I live a balanced life. I\\'m also a Libra and my life seems to match up to those horoscopes most of the time to also paint a picture of myself. So instead of rambling on and on and on as I\\'m surprised if anyone is even still reading this, I\\'m going to get straight to the point. I\\'ve learned a lesson in life and it is difficult to grasp!! The lesson is, no one actually truely cared about me all along but myself. It was me all along that cared too much about what people thought. It was my reactions towards situations that hurt me and made me think people hate me. I have to come to terms that I am simply an imperfect human being with odd characteristics as everyone else! We are all so unique and in our own little worlds. We all work differently and that\\'s how we all fit together just as a puzzle and how each piece is unique and all work together. Sometimes it takes a while for the pieces to come together and sometimes they seem to fit but they don\\'t really work well and you can\\'t actually fit them perfectly. Sometimes different pieces in the puzzle need to be as far away as possibly to work perfect and help complete the picture. It is okay to not get along with everyone but when they show their dislike I need to keep calm and carry on. What I mean by our own little worlds is, everything around us is determined by our own judgements and the way we see things around us. We all see things differently, our brains work differently and you can clearly see we are all different so that proves our own little worlds. We all automatically look out for our own well being. So my whole life I was thinking too hard about what people thought of me. Once someone expressed their slight 2 second care about me, my reaction made me believe that everyone hated me. It was a delusion. I had a chain reaction because once I believed everyone hates me my actions and reactions more than likely changed that held characteristics that are easy to dislike by other people. Hopefully out of all of this rambling is that I can continue to realize these thoughts of mine and start to have a better attitude towards life. I hope I can bring light and new helpful ideas to the world. I strive to be the best I can for myself and others. I will react to others even when they do me wrong as a calm and collected individual. I will handle my fight instinct as a normal human in complete control. I will continue to just be myself and let others be themselves.', ' Did your parents ever put a lot of pressure on you to make friends?. Growing up my father always put a lot of pressure on me to make friends. He would always ask me, \"Who do you talk to in school? Who do you hang out with in school? Why are you always alone?\" He always tried to encourage me to go outside and play with other kids. He would get very hostile and say things like, \"YOU\\'RE ALWAYS ALONE. EVERYTIME I SEE YOU YOU\\'RE ALONE. YOU NEED FRIENDS.\" He would always tell me, \"You\\'re only young once. You need to live these years to the fullest.\" I had friends in school, I just never talked to them or hung out with them outside of school. I didn\\'t live in close proximity to them. But talking to them in school was enough for me. My father wasn\\'t in school with me so he had no idea what I did in school. I had friends in school, I had my siblings, and a few cousins who I would spend time with. That was enough for me. Even to this day my father asks, \"Are you making friends in college? Are you making friends as work?\" I understand his concern as a parent, but I just think my father put way too much pressure on me. Can you guys relate? ', 'My most recent experience. I\\'m making a mess out of this recent situation I have going on. So I got in an university about a week and a half ago. My classes started this past week and I still didn\\'t go a single day. Last Monday I just felt like I didn\\'t want to but in reality I was just running away like I always do. Tuesday I left my house with the intent of going but about midway through I just started panicking and instead walked around the city so my family didn\\'t start suspecting of anything. I swear I never walked as much a I did that day it was pathetic, and all because I\\'m afraid to go to class. That was when I decided that I wouldn\\'t go at all that week and instead I\\'d prepare myself and today I\\'d be in a changed man an all the fear and anxiety would be gone. Late night Sunday the same disgusting feeling started going on again. Heart racing, this awful feeling on my stomach where you are completely comfortable on your couch yet it feels like something isn\\'t right... I go to YouTube and start watching the same guys again and again trying to get this awful feeling out of my body, trying to find some sort of miraculous solution for my problems. Today I wake up, leave my house to go to school but each stride makes me more and more anxious. I create all these movies inside my head \"How will they react, Will I be accepted What should I Say, Will they talk to me, What I they ask me a question....\" so, like last week, I just didn\\'t go again instead I\\'m typing this in the sort of park while listening to music. This same thing happened to me last year too, i spent about a week going to university and turning back last moment without entering the actual school room because I was afraid of what I\\'d find out The worst part is that I\\'m breaking the trust of my family who thinks I\\'m being an adult and being responsible. Im 25 years old, I\\'m \"studying\" in my city, what am I afraid of? I don\\'t get it I know that once I eventually break this cycle I\\'ll look back and think I had nothing to be scared of, like I said the same happened to me last year and after going things went pretty smoothly. I know taking action is the most difficult part and I get inside my own head way too much. I don\\'t know what I expect by making this post. I know it all comes down to me and me only at the end, there\\'s no Jordan Peterson, no Robbins, no random YouTube video that is going to help me, any exercise that will help me. I guess I hope to find someone to make myself accountable, or someone who went through the same or maybe I hope that by admitting to someone my situation I\\'ll see how stupid I\\'m being. Anyway this is my most recent experience', ' My dad always made me feel really bad for not having friends or a social life.. My whole life my father has always been very critical on my social life. As a kid, he always gave me a hard time for not going outside and playing with other kids. He would always ask me, \"Who do you talk to in school? Who do you hangout with in school? Why are you always by yourself? You don\\'t have any friends.\" It even got to a point where he started forcing me to go outside to try to force me to play with the other kids. That caused a lot of resentment. Even to this day, he asks me \"Are you making friends in college/ at work?\" I understand his concern as a parent, but I just think he put too much pressure on me to make friends and just made me feel bad for not being social enough. I do feel like this has interfered with my ability to make friends. I feel like I try too hard now, and it backfires. Can you guys relate?

Help?!?!!\", 'I have no friends and I feel lonely. * Post is going to be long and thank you to anyone who actually reads all of it Okay so I’m 19F and I have no friends. In high school I had 2-3 really close friends including my main best friend lets call her BFF, and a bunch of other friends mainly just people I talked to and hung with in school and class but was never truly close with. So my bff and I were super close all of high school until about the end of march when she basically ditched me for a new group of friends she made. We would still talk and I was her “best friend” but once she started hanging out with her new friend group she never included me, stopped telling me about important thing going on in her life, etc and overall just acting really snobby and conceited. I ended up confessing to one of the other girls I was really close with what was happening, and she was by my side and supported me. My bff and I ended up talking everything through and were good but things didn’t really change. She kept hanging out with them at all times never including me and when I did hang with them (once) she barely spoke to me the entire time. After we graduated she had two weeks in our city before she had to go away and start summer semester at a college far away but still in the same state. She spent the whole two with her new friend group and only gave me one day to hang out 3 days before she had to leave. During this time I was at my dad’s house and was so pissed that she would do this to me that I was not going to leave my dads house just so she could see me when she had all this time to and didn’t. Summer goes along and we didn’t talk not even once. At this point in my life I had decided to start school in the spring to give myself some time because I felt that I needed it and my only two friends were the girl that helped me out with my bff and her best friend who was also my friend. The entire summer we barely hung out. After summer we hung out a couple times but they were all super boring. I’m personally very outgoing and a hyped up type of person when I’m around people I feel comfortable with. They would just sit there and not want to do anything fun or engaging. I don’t mean get drunk and party all night, but like go makeup shopping or play fun stupid games, go out to eat, talk about boys, go shopping, go to the beach, or in general anything besides like going to one of their houses and playing nintendo wii. Plus on top off all this they were very judgy and would look at me weird for saying something outside of the box. When I would ask one of them about the boys in the college I was going to go to in the spring she would be dry and uninterested. Then in October I got a job, and I really like the place I work at. When we would hang out and I would try to tell them about the people and like the tea going on at work they didn’t care and I would talk and they didn’t respond and I felt like I was talking to my self. All of this plus the fact that since they were each others best friend they wouldn’t include me in a lot of their convos and then bring up things when I was there made me feel really lonely and tired. Eventually was broke the camels back was that drama basically started again with my bff and when I texted them I was just going to text her and end this once and for all they both started sending messages like “oooohhh can’t wait for the tea” or “🐸☕️”, “the tea it hot” and in general things like that. I was so offended because instead of being there for me and supporting me bc they both knew how hurt and emotionally affected I was from the situation between my bff and I all they cared about was the tea and the drama. A month after this happened I cut them off but only talked to one of them. It was the one that helped me in the beginning with my bff. I thanked her for supporting and that I was always going to be grateful for that but that our friend ship was over and I explained to her how they made me feel and basically she texted me back cursing me out and saying a whole bunch of rude shit and I never texted her again. Both of them blocked me on all social media platforms and I have not seen, heard, or talked to them since that day. I started college but online bc I have no transportation to campus so I have no interactions with people my own age and at my job it’s mainly middle aged women and a few young people but not anyone I consider to have a good connection friendship wise with. It gets me so sad to see my ex bff on social media going to parties and having fun, making friends, etc. when I wish I was doing that. Plus just in general watching young people my age having fun and hanging out with their “squad” makes me depressed! Because I want that. Now because of my friendless life and because I have little to no interaction with people my own age in over a year I’m beyond scared to do school on campus so I’ve decided to do all of college online. I’ve definitely gotten a lot anxiety in regards to being social with people my own age and also boys. I’ve never had a boyfriend or even talked to anyone and with my whole lonely no friends no social life situation I’m never going to meet one and if I do, I mentally I’ve already sabotaged myself because I think to myself how embarrassing it would be to meet a boy and when he asks about my friend me tell him that I have none. Like how fucking embarrassing and lame does that sound. So to avoid this Im just not gonna let any potential guy get close enough. Plus I’m insecure about my body bc Im a little chubby but don’t do anything to change this because I have zero motivation. So far the only good things going for me are my job, school, and my immediate family. I get depressed when I think about the fact that I’m so young and I have no friends anyone to hangout with and have normal social interactions with. Like am I really going to waste all of my young years stuck in my house all day and working as much as possible. Sometimes I think that the best I can do is graduate and keep moving up in the company I work for now and become a workaholic and live with my parents until forever. Sorry for this long ass stupid rant. Goodbye Im sad as fuck now low key crying and depressed:))))', \"Confronted a friend that I thought hated me.. drunk. I will start with; I was at a party yesterday. I suffer from social anxiety disorder and I've had the oh so typical social anxiety thought that people hate me lately. I have a specific friend who my attention has been on lately because he really doesn't talk that much to me, almost forgot to say hello to me when he arrived to this party (even though that's probably not true, alot of people there to say hello to) I know for a fact that this is like the nicest guy that exist in the world, but my brain is a wierdo so.. Should also add that he is a few steps above acquaintance level. There had been some quite heavily alcohol intake from everyone at this party and sometime during the night me and a friend decide to take a walk around the neighborhood and he decides to come with. I tell my friend about this feeling about him hating me (2nd time, have talked about it before and she says that's not the case). This situation ends up with me deciding it's a great time to tell him how I feel. My friend ends up telling him that I feel this way with my permission (He also doesn't know I have anxiety or any problems btw). He then comes over and of course tells me that's absolutely not the case. I suddenly break down crying and hyperventilating in his arms and we talk it out as best we can (we are alone at this stage). My friend then gets back and in my drunk state I pretty much word vomit out a confusing summary of my history with anxiety and my current state to them. We keep on walking the three of us and he keep comforting me with kind words, small hugs and back touches until we arrive back at the party with me now close to anxiety free. I'm now a little confused about this. I'm honestly glad I told him, it feels like it got rid a little bit of the whole thought about people hating me. I also feel guilty that I brought another person in to my anxiety. I sent him a message this morning apologising about that he had to see that and that I put him in this position, and he said everything was cool and I believe him. I honestly thought I would have more anxiety about this but a big part of me just laughs at this whole situation which is wierd. So this is just a little bit of a vent from a hungover girl. Anyone else in here that is as stupid as me when they're drunk?  and#x200B; Also, sorry if the english is a bit sh\\\\*t i'm from sweden.\", 'How do I [21/F] be comfortable around boys, not be nervous and start a conversation?. I\\'ve known a classmate [24/M] since 4 years now. He\\'s seriously a nice guy; asked me to see him *face to face* in college (I\\'m saying because I can\\'t talk face to face with boys..), asked me to see him after class, texted me he was looking out for me after exam, sends hundred emojis in text, asked me to video chat, invited me to a city rally, invited me to watch him play guitar, sends me pictures of the place he\\'s visiting, asks me if I want something from that place, sends me pictures of himself (and his mother, I don\\'t know why mother too), suddenly sends me a picture of a cut on his hand he got when he was playing guitar and captioned it \"love bite\", posts my text as his status on WhatsApp, last night (out of the blue) sent me pictures of his wins in PUBG. We were sitting in a room, he\\'s a coordinator of the committee and he walked past me and stood beside my chair. All this when I don\\'t reciprocate, at all. I\\'m always nervous so I just act like I\\'m least interested and come cold. The one time I hit back was when I said it was \"a loss\" for... a girl he\\'s had a crush on, and he told me about that, and he proposed her and she rejected. I don\\'t feel anything special for him but I do notice his l behaviour which seems confusing to me. If he already has a crush, why\\'s he trying to crush me? Well, but, my problem is that we\\'ve not talked beside texting, although we\\'re in the same class but we don\\'t talk in person. I realise that he wants to talk, but I just have nothing to say and no confidence to begin, so I just sit and hope I get crushed under a rock. Anyone sane in my shoes will take this opportunity to reciprocate, gel up, hangout and see each other. His \"crush\" is pretty outgoing and talks to boys and girls, so everyone in general, although she\\'s not very friendly, but l come off as boring, nervous and clueless. I\\'m pathetic, but I don\\'t want to be. Who knows if I actually talk to him in person instead of just texting him, we may develop some emotions, but I can\\'t put into words how blank and awkward I feel. I\\'ve lost so many opportunities by coming across as uninterested when boys I knew gave me clear signals of their interest, but in my defence I was enjoying my life and not involved in premarital relationships, thus being moral (I\\'m quite conservative, don\\'t judge), but now I\\'m old enough to be in a relationship with a decent man and marry him if all goes well, I\\'m not kid anymore, but, the fuck, I act like a kid because that hides my lack of confidence. I was raised in a small town and wasn\\'t allowed to talk to boys, I\\'ve always kept some distance from men, so it feels like approaching a whole new specie! We were writing an exam today; his friend and I were in the same class. He came to our room after exam, looked at us and tried to tell a joke. Went outside, and looked at me for a while from the entrance. When I went out of the room, he was standing outside alone; him and I saw each other and... I rushed back into the classroom and walked away with a friend. I wanted to talk to him, I don\\'t know if he did really stand there for me but he was still alone, and I missed him! I\\'m so anxious and nervous Help!', \"What's the difference between being an introvert and having social anxiety?. I have social anxiety, but at the same time, I think I could also be a natural introvert. I've been a quiet shy person since I was a small child. I still am at 21. My father always gave me a hard time for not wanting to go outside and play like the other children. He always gave me a hard time for being quiet. So I would like to know what's the difference between the two because many people are naturally more quiet and reserved?\", 'What anxiety do normal people feel?. I always see lots of very outgoing people dropping hints about anxiety on Instagram stories where the last thing they posted was them at a party and I just don’t understand how they have anxiety, isn’t a party like the peak of social events? And they’re a daily thing for these people ?? I mean i know i don’t know what’s going on inside them but i just can’t see how. Yesterday I was taking a walk and some kid my age approached me and tried to introduce himself I guess by asking me questions about myself like my name and shit and this whole interaction was so alien and nerve racking to me I didn’t even understand that I was supposed to ask those things back until like 10 minutes later. I hadn’t even realized Id been looking down the entire time even though i was trying to make eye contact. I was basically stunned the whole time. My anxiety isn’t even close to crippling (like to the point where I can’t go outside) so I don’t understand how people who are used to having normal interactions and conversations and have confidence and stuff like that experience anxiety. Like where? When? I feel like I’m gatekeeping.', \" If you somehow got a GF, would you handle it?. If a perfect girl somehow showed up and wanted to date you, would you even give it a try? After years of fighting with social anxiety I finally got to the point where I can go with a girl for a walk or coffee without getting a panic attack. But I realised I'm still far from a point where i could even think about dating. Here's a short list of what im scared of: - introducing her to family/friends - going to parties/weddings together - getting rejected by her after some time - organizing our own wedding - i know it's long way but I'd never be able to do it Anyone else? :) \", \"Not sure if I have social anxiety or something else. As a kid i was pretty social. I had an best friend, we played all the time and i spoke to some other people too. I was a little shy sometimes. At the age of 12 in my new class which included my best friend I was very distant with the others i wasn't really interested in making friends (i thought this would happen automatically like when i was litte hehe it wasn't the case :') ) I never talked in class. i just talked with my best friend at the time but now we are pretty distant. Then I slowly began to feel lonely and making new friends wasn't an option im always uncomfortable and nervous when i talk to strangers and i know that i have like really low conversation skills i avoid it because I know i will fail. I began to sleep less at night , I wanted to gain some extra hours to enjoy my day because school is far from enjoyable. I always take 2-3 hour naps after school because it's very exhausting to sit there for 7 hours straight and being bored . After the naps i still feel tired and depressed . The only time i feel like being alive is at the weekend or vacation .I am in peace when i don't have to go outside and talk with anybody. I feel like i put myself in a cage and there is no way to let my true personality see the daylight. Okay I think I just answered my own question idk have I ? Do you guys feel the same ? This is a lot of personal info 😅 I never really talk about my feelings. Its feels good to write it down thought I probably made some mistakes in my orthograph. Sorry for my English\", \"Why does it feel like I'm the only person with social anxiety/shyness in real life?. Supposedly 3-8% of people have social anxiety and 10-20% are shy. Yet when I go outside to places like school, work, and stores nobody shows any signs of being shy. Everyone is outgoing, confident, and extroverted. Yet there's so many shy people on the internet. And I've only seen maybe 1 or 2 other loners like me despite having seen a few thousand people. What gives?\", 'My life story (a long one). So I don’t know if anyone will read this but That’s okay, I think I’m posting this for myself just to sort my feelings out and such. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been super shy. I don’t know why. Nothing happened to me as a child, I have a great family and have great friends so I don’t know why I have this debilitating issue. I looked it up, and i learned that sometimes people with an overactive amygdala have a heightened fight or Flight response therefore causing more severe anxiety. So maybe it’s a biological thing for me, but I have thought of anything at all that could have affected me to be like this but nothing comes to mind. Throughout middle school, I haven’t even realized but In seventh grade I was depressed. I don’t think I knew it. I knew I was sad but didn’t know if it went further than that. I don’t remember being suicidal then, but seventh grade was the first time I started to self harm. I was always getting in trouble with my parents, I’ve always felt like they’re out to get me and I never show or receive any affection. Because of this, me and my parents relationships is not the best. and I know it’s my fault. They try to understand why I act certain ways but I don’t even know myself. I wish I had an answer. So anyway, an incident happened in seventh grade where I had to share something with the class. Presentations always scared me and being in front of the class always did. Even if it was a simple yes or no question. I can’t stand being the center of attention and I always cry when I feel this social anxiety coming on. We had to share poems we had written and I just remember being so scared, I just started crying and couldn’t get through it. I remember my classmates faces and they were so confused and I was confused to. I knew it was just a presentation but my body had another idea. To this day I’m not sure if that was my first anxiety attack? and I’m not sure if I’ve ever had an anxiety attack because I never feel like the world is ending I just get so embarrassed I think, that all I can do is cry and my heart starts beating rapidly, and I’m shaking and I just wanna disappear. But do people have anxiety attacks differently? If you know, please help. Anyway, after that happened I was SO mortified I didn’t even want to go back to school. I always assumed people labeled me as the super shy freak girl and wouldn’t want to talk to me anyway so I decided to do virtual school in eighth grade. No one knows that’s the reason I decided to be homeschooled. I just tell everyone “I don’t know just felt like it” when they ask because I don’t want to tell them my embarrassing story. So virtual school actually turned out to be awful and so I ended up starting high school for 9th grade as a freshman. Because I skipped out on 8th grade, I already didn’t have many friends. And the ones I did have, lets call her Lauren. She was my absolute best friend and we ended up having a class together so that was the class I looked forward to. I remember always being isolated in my other classes while everyone else talked and I would be so scared around people and scared that someone would talk to me. I didn’t have many friends that year. I also repeatedly cut and I was developing an addiction. Come sophomore year, I was deeply depressed. My best friend, still Lauren, she glew up. She became popular and gorgeous and it was hard being friends with her sometimes because she had so many friends and guys all over her. I know it wasn’t her fault of course, and through it all she stuck by me and I couldn’t be more grateful to have someone like her to this day. But I can’t Help but feel inferior when I’m with her sometimes. I would always think “people are probably wondering why she’s friends with you” “they just think you’re a charity case” I was so quiet all the time. I honestly don’t remember much of sophomore year. I just remember being sad all the time. I remember drawing sad sketches. I discovered and became obsessed with twenty One pilots, (still my favorite band today and I’m seeing them this year FLOOR TICKETS! can’t wait haha.) so come junior year, I told myself if I wasn’t happier by the end of the year I would kill myself before senior year. I met my other best friend junior year and we are so similar it’s crazy. So greatful for her friendship. Still struggled with self harm. I started to maybe get a little better, or so I thought I was. I got my first job at Burger King, which was not the wisest decision. Smoked weed and got high for the first time. Developed a huge crush on a boy who did nothing but lead me on. It really wrecked me and I don’t think he has any idea of how much to this day. Pierced my nose. I think I kept trying new experiences to feel something, convince myself to stay. I thought it was working but deep down, I was the same. Didn’t self harm as much because it wasn’t as easy to hide anymore. And my mom found out a little later and everything just got a bit crazy. Forced into therapy and parents found a pipe and new I was smoking. They were absolutely furious. I also was caught with a boy over at like 2 am by my mom. Not my finest moment. I think this was definitely my most impulsive year. I started to do things that scared me and that I knew was wrong but I think I was just trying to fill the void I had. One night I decided I had enough and tried to overdose on vistaril. I remember feeling the effects of it and becoming super tired so I thought that was it. I went to bed peacefully. Well, spoiler, I woke up. I was so mad I hadn’t taken enough but I think I was also relieved. I read about liver damage and all that and I decided that if I was going to do it again, I would take enough so I wouldn’t end up in the hospital impaired all my life. So summer before senior year, my best friend, Lauren, invited me to a church camp. I’ve always been a Christian and such but never had a relationship with God. That camp was a turning point for me. I met so many people and developed so many friendships and it opened my eyes to a life I wanted to live. And for the first time, I felt like I had support. People who were there for me and like I had God. But my depression still didn’t go away. I was still sad. So so sad. One of the hardest things I’ve ever done, is opened up and told my feelings of depression and suicidal ideation to. One night at the camp, it was the last night and we were all in this big room sharing stories or just venting things we needed to get off of our chest. Telling people things we needed prayer for. I told everyone In that room, maybe 60 people, my plans of killing myself. How I was going to before senior year but that this camp changed my mind. And I could barely get through it without crying. After that, a lot of people came to hug me and tell me to stay strong and that they were there for me. It was an amazing and cool experience. But I started attending church with her and becoming stronger in my faith and I connecting with amazing people. I went to Guatemala in 2017 on a mission trip and it was an amazing experience. Everything was as good as could be. I just wanted to be done with High school and done with my past there. I was ready for college and what life had for me. I can’t believe it, but I was dare I say hopeful. I felt guilty for being anxious and depressed as a Christian though. It of course, was no where as near as bad as it was but I still woke up and felt that same emotionless i felt for so long and tiredness. Soon enough, I just accepted it. People think that because I have Jesus now that I’m okay. But inside I am still hurting and depressed. I think about suicide almost everyday but I would never act on it. I know God is there for me and would never want me to do this, his plans are always greater. And I believe that, I do. I went to Montreal on a mission trip this past November and it was awesome. I love helping people and showing gods love and although it’s hard to connect with people sometimes due to social anxiety, i know I’ll get through it. But still depression lingers. I worked at chick fil a for a bit but quit due to anxiety and the amount of people there and all. I try daily to get back up. I need a job but I’m scared to get one just to become over whelmed and quit again. I keep letting people down. I still want to die. I wish I could just go peacefully. I feel like a ghost among the living and I’ve always felt like something Is wrong with me. I’m on meds and I always dream of overdosing but I could never. I have a tattoo dedicated basically saying “this may suck but God’s still got you”. It’s “And if not, he is still good”. I got that tattoo and wrote my testimony about having social anxiety and living through it. I feel like a hypocrite for feeling like I want to die still. I always encourage others and tell them that it does get better and to hold on and I hope they believe me when I say it and can’t see behind my mask. I think I believe it when I say it to them. But for some reason my mind makes me believe that I will never succeed and I’m bound to live a purposeless life. Everyday I wake up and I say just another day to exist. Just doing my classes and occasionally meeting up with friends. I feel like I’m lying to them. No one knows how I feel am I’m ashamed to tell them. I don’t want them to take pity on me and I don’t want to treated like I’m going to break if they touch me. I am in a new relationship. My first boyfriend, and he is the sweetest most amazing thing. But I’m scared to tell him how I feel. I warned him of my depression and anxiety but I didn’t tell him the extent of it. He doesn’t know I self harm. Which I did for the first time in about 6 months yesterday. He saw and I told him it was the cat. Lame excuse and I don’t think he bought it. I’m torn between scared of telling him and him not wanting to deal with this or just tell him because he was going to leave anyway. either way I lose. it’s best to be honest right? Anyway. I know this is super long so thanks for reading if you did. Any comments / suggestions / advice is welcome. Thanks. By the way I’m 19', 'A different type of social anxiety. As I get closer to my 30\\'s I have mostly shaken off the most inconvenient aspects of SA. I can now ask for directions, make small talk, be vocal in class (I\\'m a student), things 18 year old me never would have believed. However, I have yet to work through the biggest hurdle, groups. I *cannot* integrate into groups for fear of being rejected or worse, mocked or ridiculed. Growing up, in various situations (eg. summer camp) while people slowly started to form alliances and friendships I was always the person left standing alone. I chose to isolate myself as a defence mechanism, and still do to this day. Now I\\'m convinced that I\\'ve missed out on crucial social skills, and the older I get, the lonelier it feels. I imagine others view me as a stuck up cunt, especially since I look the part of a \"normal\" person. I believe my dad took his own life due to the same feelings of loneliness and isolation I\\'m experiencing. Some days I feel like checking out too. TL;DR: I think groups will reject me so I stay away.', ' Cant handle it anymore. Hey guys so its gotten to the point were every waking moment im just a nervous wreck. I just came back from the grocery store i cant even buy my items without going all red and extremely nervous. Im tired of this shit. There is a beautiful forest behind my house i might go and end my suffering :( ', 'I had a norminal conversation with a cute cashier. I was going from my therapy late at night and I saw this little bakery still opened. With worries mounting I have decided to try venturing in to explore the dungeon. I have entered the store and a really pretty girl greeted me politely. Likely because I was so tired that evening, my brain lapsed and forgot to flip on the anxiety engagement switch. So I had a quick glance over their selection of cakes and I went on to ask about whether they had any with cherries. She said no, but we have a tasty forest fruit mix cake. I was like \"that\\'s the next best thing, gimme 2 pieces of that\". She smiled, got me my cake and said they have a special discount so late at night. I paid and wished her great evening. It all went so fucking smooth. I did eye contact, smiled, asked a question...no anxiety. I felt high as a kite walking home. 🙂 It was so rare. I wish everyone such an experience! TL;DR: walked in like a boss, didn\\'t melt in front of a pretty cashier, got a tasty cake', \" Everyone wants you to be perfect and i don't want to be perfect. bitch this world is expecting you to be fucking perfect.I hate this you have to hide all your bad personality traits and shit so that you're going to be accepted anywhere. man, why can't people accept everyone and not picking the best you always have to do competition i hate how this world works ahhhhh kill me please this is too much stress. life is to difficult for me and im too lazy to live. Just like give me a big fucking break that never ends. I want to crawl in a hole and never go outside ever again. This shit got me so fucking tired i swear, somebody please hire a hitman to kill me. Hit me with a car idk This is my vision of the world perhaps not everybody expects you to be perfect but people just always want the best this is how humanity works and it sucks \", \"Can't fricken connect to anyone even after putting myself out there.. So over the past few months I've really, really been trying to connect to people and make friends. But no matter how hard I try, it never leads anywhere. I joined a running group and starting talking to people in that group. First couple of times, had a few conversations with people that lead no where. The third time I decided to just sit back and observe. You know what I noticed? Pretty much everyone just converses with their one or two friends and ignores everyone else. They are nice enough that they will talk to you if you talk to them, but the split second you go silent they will go right back to ignoring you and talking with their buddies. I've tried talking to classmates (I'm in grad school) but the conversation always just ends up with us talking about school and then trailing into silence.  and#x200B; Like, I'm so fucking far out of practice that I just don't even know how to converse with people. I have zero idea how to keep a conversation going or even make it remotely interesting. I hate myself, thanks for listening to my rant.  and#x200B;\", 'My story. Includes social anxiety, body dysmorphia and incel. English is not my native language, so u can read some weird words. I will try to ´´summarize´´ this (at the bottom, there is a real summary). As a child, when i was around 11, i was really attractive to everyone. I know this because at school, i got all the girls chasing me, and so outside. Obviously, i was too young to ´´benefit´´ on this. At that age, i remember myself as an outgoing kid, that had friends and did some regular stuff. Later on, something happened. I think that the inflection point was the haircut that i started wearing, the classic mushroom haircut that a lot of kids wear...with the difference that i was a teenager already. From being a young Adonis, i started to hear the mock of some girls, through the nicknames that they put on me, refered to my haircut. All my friends started having some interactions with girls, while i was just staring, too afraid of rejection. That was the beginning of my fearful existence, and it continued (with ups and downs) until my current age of 25. So yeah, right now i feel like i didnt live at all. I never had a girlfriend, i only have 1 friend that i meet every few months, i never had a job and never been to a party. This decade has been a mix of playing World of Warcraft, doing sport (cycling and calisthenics, obv individual sports), and studying some random useless shit that my mother suggested me to. I feel like it doesnt matter what i study, since there is people in almost every single profession. Ive studied hostelry and quitted it cos its too customer-facing. Ive studied sport and physical activity animator...but it was only because i like to practice it, im too insecure for teaching or doing anything in fron of a group. Now i switched to programming...but seems that im too autistic even for the nerd-world, since the teacher already told me that i have to learn to participate more while working in a groupal project...but i just end up excluding myself. Sport is what saved me through all this time. When im at home, i cant stop thinking about the past and the future, and i listen a lot of depressing music. So i need to take a ride on my bike almost every day. Im prety good at it and its hard to think about random shit when you are under big physical effort. I consider myself a good interlocutor, but i only can show this in individual conversations. In a group (specially if i dont know the members), im unable to articulate a single word unless someone ask my oponion directly. This is hard for me, because everybody that ever meet me, told me that im a very witty person and i can contribute to the conversation. Im really quick at making word games. Somebody once told me that i should try rap battles. And i would...if i could articulate a fucking word in front of groups of strangers -.-º. Because of this witty personality, i know that people want me in their groups, and i got invited to random plans and parties many times...but always refused. I just cant stop thinking about little details that throw me back: what if i have to dance, what if they wanna take photos, what if my clothes are not suitable...And so, for me, saturday is just another weekday to play WoW and do some sport... I once challenged myselft to go to a psychologist. Since the first session was free and it was one to one conversation, i thought i had no excuse. It went pretty well, she got really interested in me, because we talked for an hour and a half (the session had one hour) and she even invited me to come for another free session and to pay whatever amount i could for the next ones. Not to vary, i rejected... As to relationships, ive always been on this dating webs, but it has been useless because my profile photos sucks. I hate being photographed, i dont want to recognize myself on the pics(i think im much better in person) .I always have the same 3 pics from a specific angle and blurry. I consider myself pretty good at flirting, but if the profile pic is not attractive, u wont get the chance to start a conversation. And so, i didnt meet a single girl this way. Well...i actually met one. It was on a social anxiety forum. We exchanged numbers. I could see her picture, but she couldnt see mine, so everything was ok xD. She was really pretty, which surprised me(even more, when i discovered that she had like 1k followers on IG). We chatted for a week straight, it was amazing. One day, she asked me to meet in real life, which is really hard for me, but after those conversations, i thought there was feeling between us, so i accepted. We met in a bar. She was really beautiful irl, but not as perfect as in those IG pics, which i liked even more. At first, we were kinda nervous, but the beer made its effect and we talked for hours.It was getting late and she suggested me to pass the night in my house. Im naive, but i think i know what this kind of proposition means...Still it was a terrible idea, cos i live with my mom. Dont know how and why, i ended up accepting. Before arriving to my house, i thorowed up(cos i smoked, and that makes me sick most of the times). Once in my house, my mom woke up...Well, we ended up sleeping on the same bed, but nothing could have happened cos i was too wasted X_X. Surprisingly, she wanted to keep meeting with me, and we met one more time, a few months later. The most remarkable about this one, is that we kissed. It was a really quick and cold experience, so i dont even consider it as i ever kissed. The fact that she kissed me (obv it was she who went for it) without passion, meant a lot for me. The next day, i told her to break up, because i was getting feelings, and she told me that she only was looking for friendship. She insisted in meeting again, but i rejected. That was the last time i had something with a girl, two years ago. And this is how i learned that u cant have social anxiety and 1k followers on IG by posting pics of your body. Ive cried a lot after that break up, and now im again on that numb state that everything is bad, but not enough to cry... How do i know that i have body dysmorphia. Simple: because im the supreme textrovert. I feel very secure when it comes to written comunication (more on my native language). I consider myself good at flirting (i know how to tease) and i use to troll a lot (even whole groups of people), specially the people that cry about their situation or blame others. Everything is ok as long as they dont see a picture of me. One really strange thing is that, in videogames, i never been able to speak through a microphone, which is a requirement for doing a lot of fun stuff. So i ended up being a loner even in videogames. Add that to my completism (im obsessed with achieving everything that is achievable in the games (and irl too)). Overall, i think i have a really great body, specially because i practiced several sports for more than ten years, Im 1.85 height, 70kg with very lean muscles and long legs. My hair is of an amazing quality and my haircut now is an upgraded version of the mushroom style that i think began everything xD. It makes me look younger. I dont like a lot of things about my face, but i think it has some personality. And down there, im slightly over the average. On the other hand, lets talk about what i dont like and what keeps me locked in this mental prison. I dont like my short arms, it makes me feel inferior in some sports (i feel like i have to be the best in everything). I actually started thinking that people with short arms are doomed, or something like that :/. I dont like my nose and how it looks when i smile (thats why i never smile in photos) I dont like how my hair looks when its wet, and the fordyce spots on my lips. I got the fordyce spots down there, too. They are harmless small white sebaceous bumps under the skin. Despite being well endowed, i focus more on the spots and the form of my D, which i dont like neither. Ive been watching porn for more than ten years, and it changes yourself physically and mentally. I cant stop comparing myself to the men that appear on the videos. I know almost everything about my conditions and my ´´flaws´´, because ive been reading shit about them for too long. The conclusion is that there is no magical solution, u just have to accept yourself. I read a lot about spirituality, too. Thats why i know that my goal in this life is to trascend this extreme identification with the body. To kill the ego, to live in the moment...but God, its been more than ten years and i didnt perceive much progress...I even know the techniques (meditation, self love affirmations, etc), but i end up thinking about the bad things. I still have hope, tho, and dont even contemplate suicide, because i would have to learn the lesson on the next life. Jesus, its tooking me the whole weekend to write this...with huge breaks, of course. Im such a perfectionist that i have to think a lot before before writing a line, then rewrite it...and i dont even like the final result. If you made it here: congratulations, you really deserve a prize xD! Here is the summary of this bible. I feel that i have a lot of amazing attributes, Physically im very fit because ive been practicing differen sports for more than ten years. Ive got a strong personality and witty sense of humor, as people say. Im good at flirting, too. But i just can show it. I isolate myself every time, reject invitations to social plans and let go a lot of chaces. I do this because im terrified of other peoples judgements, specially towards my body (in the supreme textrovert). Im very insecure sexually because of the classic fordyce spot issue. Now the real questions. Does anyone identify to this? Did anyone overcome a similar situation or have any advices? Do anyone wanna share his story? Thx 4 reading!', 'What is wrong with me. I\\'ll try to keep this short. I\\'m 25 and I currently live in Brooklyn. I\\'ve been here my whole life with the exception of college. Speaking of college, I have a bachelors degree in English (I know) I am currently unemployed and my last two jobs were in non profit academic advisory roles. I was pretty much a loner and hated school throughout life. I was taken to a therapist when i was 12, and they declared I was \"normal.\" I started questioning life in college and realized it was pretty useless and that it was school and work until you die. I drank liquor i would say the normal amount for a college student. After graduating, I took the two advisory jobs which I hated both jobs due to anxiety. I am not a people person in general and I would sweat profusely when talking to students or even in mildy hot temperatures. I sweat 10x more than others even in the winter. I would sweat in a crowded subway or platform or talking to new people. I spoke to a doctor and I was prescribed robinul and told I had hyperhydrosis. The robinul works so that part of my life is solved temporarily. In addition to this, no matter what allergy medicine I take or what dose, I drip water from my nose and eyes. If I go outside especially in the morning, and its sunny or windy, my eyes water. I get acid reflux and heartburn from tomato sauce, coffee and liquor (all things I love). I also find myself getting extremely angry at the simplest things (people walking slow in the city, etc, to the point where I think about attacking someone in my head.) When I began feeling suicidal at my first job after graduation, I spoke to a therapist again who once again told me I was \"normal\" a \"regular new yorker\". At this point I am at a wits end and speak to another doctor who prescribes me zoloft and other downers. I mix them with alcohol in a excessive amounts to cope with the job I hate. I stop taking the zoloft pretty because they didn\\'t work for me. I was taking to a hospital where people told me i was a handsome man who had things to live for and sat next to a girl with 16 cut marks on her arm and a guy who wanted to start fires with his hands. I did my research before hand and I realized that they would probably give me shock therapy (I don\\'t know how that would help) so I pretended to feel better. Fast forward to today, I am unemployed living off my parent. I work out about three or four times a week, I am about 5\\'11 195. The only problem is I have little to no appetite daily and I am starting to develop a belly. I eat maybe twice a day (where i force myself to eat),I sweat like Patrick Ewing in the fourth quarter if I don\\'t take robinul and i work out 4 times a week So this is unexplainable to me Anyway, I\\'ve had ultrasounds, endoscopy, colonscopy and the gastro doctor stated I was in perfect health and the only theory he has is ibs. As you can see, I\\'ve had a long series of issues in my body and doctors telling me everything is fine and blah blah etc. So I\\'m at a wit\\'s end. I also have gynecomastia in both nipples and it\\'s another obstacle that is annoying to deal with. I\\'m unemployed so I have no insurance to see any more doctors and i just think life is bullshit and I don\\'t want to deal with it. I have a girlfriend, who helps me want to keep living, although she keeps alluding to marriage in kids which I\\'m vehemently against.

Okay, growing up i used to be a very introverted kid, i enjoyed going to the mall, the beach, and all that, i didn't like to study much, but it wasn't something that bothered me back then, till 2013, i started to feel like i didn't belong there, i lacked motivation to study, in 2015 i started having panic attacks and extreme anxiety, when going out, so i had to quit school at the age of 15, now its 2019 and i still haven't come back yet, i have no hopes for my future, would like to comeback to school tho, but im too afraid of social exposure,especially after so long whiteout going but, i still have hopes i will get better, i spent all day at home playing games, watching youtube, and i must say its not good to be like that, i would like to get better, but when i make plans to get out, i always end up no going last minute. so yeah i have hopes one day i will get better, you know, go back to school or something, but its really hard. if you don't mind, whats your story with social anxiety?\", \"Dating a girl who has social anxiety? Would appreciate your advice.. 25 M, here. So, I've been on a date with a girl I met online, which went extremely well. I chatted with her for a week before I met her. She had asked me out, but left it to me to decide what the date would be. I suggested coffee, but she told she'd prefer a walk first. So we took a walk across the park, during which we built up a good rapport. Later, we went to grab a bite and visited another place for ice-cream. My dumbass self forgot that she was not comfy in crowds, and I suggested going for a music fest with a huge crowd for a second date. She then finally told me about her SA, and how it made her avoid crowds, and that she's about to start therapy for it, soon enough. She also told me that she wasn't used to dating, and that having a romantic figure in her life made her feel a bit anxious because of the uncertainty. I'm very glad she was honest with me about it, and I am willing to support her through her SA(obviously I don't want to be her therapist). What dates would be perfect for someone with SA? And how can I make sure that she feels comfortable around me as well as how can I be as supportive as possible? I have battled and defeated my crippling anxiety, so I can understand how hard it can be for someone with SA. Thanks!  and#x200B;\", \"I literally CANNOT talk to another person.. I will try and keep a very, very long story as short as possible. So here goes. I have never been social, having only a few friends my entire life. I've always had bad social anxiety. A few years ago, my father died. I was a university student at the time and just locked myself in my room, living nocturnally and only operating when everyone else was asleep. I would go months without talking to anyone and ended up failing university and dropping out. So I moved back home with my mother and have lived as a complete shut-in for almost two years. I literally do not leave the house, I will sometimes go in the garden but no further. There is no need. Now I am just incomprehensibly socially anxious. I cannot answer the door to the mailman when he delivers parcels, or even talk to people on the phone. I realised how bad this was and had to ask my mother to book me an appointment at the therapist, which she did. So I prepared to leave the house to go to one session and when we arrived, I could not talk to him. I uttered my name and said hello and then just started crying. I just couldn't think of anything to say. So I just ran outside and back to the car. I'm a 23 year old man. This is pathetic. What do I do, please.?\", 'Small steps matter!. Every year, I set a big personal development goal. This year, my goal is to be more social, put myself out there and improve social skills. I created an action plan so I can break my journey down into manageable steps and the first step is to start studying outside of my bedroom; go to the library and be around people. It is nothing fancy, but I was always going straight back home after lectures to study so I was very rarely interacting with anyone (even if it is just eye contact) and on some days where I had no lectures, I’d be home all day on my computer. This made my social anxiety worse. Almost every day for the past 1-2 months, I have started going to the library and sitting amongst strangers which is something that always made me anxious. I could have easily put my laptop in my bag and went home – but I didn’t. Not only am I able to focus more and get work done but I am also moving forward in my social goal (no matter how small). I used to wonder if people were judging me and watching me for just taking my laptop out of my bag or my revision notes (even though everyone in the room was doing it). **And, this is a big one**. For the first time, I left my laptop and notepad in the library whilst I took a break outside for fresh air. People didn’t steal my shit! **People aren’t as scary or untrustworthy as I have often thought.** These are the first steps I made for myself and after a while I will start getting out my comfort zone and be more social. Although I am not really talking to strangers yet, I still feel I am making progress. Next up, I will be attending some workshops to try and meet people. And overtime throughout this year, I will start learning to small talk with strangers; smiling more to strangers; making phone calls; volunteering; initiating conversations rather than standing alone; asking a girl (multiple girls) out so I can finally get started as a late bloomer in this dating world; and I might even travel on my own. **Small steps matter.**', 'My ultimate guide for defeating social anxiety. Hello, I’m a 16 yo male and this is (and probably will be) my only post on this Subreddit. Recently I discovered something great, and I want you to read this post because you’re probably struggling with social anxiety dominating your life like it used to do mine. Remember that „you were born into“ a society. You were raised with patterns to follow. You are scared of breaking these patterns. Scared of breaking out of society. Scared of being rejected by it. Now I want you to differentiate between SOCIETY and HUMANITY. Society is a theoretical construct. A mindset. Society is what has these rules that make you scared of being yourself(„don‘t dress differently“, „don‘t run outside when others see you“ for example.). Humanity are people. Humanity are the people around you and the people you meet. The construct of society and these rules shall not apply for now. In my school bus is always this guy. He enters as one of the last. He‘s probably as old as me. He wears plain black clothes and tries to avoid any eye contact at all. His eyes are dead. When he sits on his seat he doesn‘t even put off his bag from his back. He doesn‘t want to make noise and come off as annoying, even though the bag taking all his space clearly makes him uncomfortable and it bothers him. This guy is affected by society. Not just affected, it‘s dominating all of his actions. Of course noone would give a f*ck if he would just put off his bag, but he still has his made-up rules carved into his mind. This applied to me aswell. Perhaps you may have seen by now that society cares, but humanity clearly doesn’t. Now at one point in the last few days I found a point: „What if I disconnected from all of this?“, „What if I didn‘t care?“. Whenever I am in an anixious situation now, for example walking past a row of cars, I tell myself: „These rules don‘t apply for me now. I‘m free now.“ I‘d like to show you another example. When someone mocks you for being an idiot(let‘s say you just stumbled and fell) and you care about it, you may feel like an idiot. Even worse, you let the bully take control over your emotions. You let him take your soul. Now what if you simply wouldn‘t care? He‘s the idiot now, He keeps mocking about you. But he keeps mocking a god. You are way out of his league now. You don’t care about his existence and his words. Instead of actually feeling like an idiot and feeling he deserves the right to mock you because society says that, he‘s just being a rude child now and you don‘t have to worry about him at all. He‘s still trapped in his little society cage, and you‘re a free and respectable human now. Perhaps maybe you may still think that ignoring society patterns may make you an outsider, and make you end up as a lonely old man/woman without having ever been loved. Think of the most confident man/woman you know. Think of someone harassing him/her. The confident person would never even let the harasser close to affecting its emotions. It doesn‘t have any emotional investment at all in the people around it because society doesn‘t have it caught in its chains. Perhaps maybe the average society-affected person will not like you now, but it will respect you. On the other hand, humanity will not only respect, but love you. Once you disconnect from society you will start to attract many great new people. And it‘s way better than being in the society hole where you have to show heavy commitment everyday in order to not be rejected. I want you to disconnect from society now. Break the patterns, break the barrier. Be comfortable and confident with yourself. This movement doesn‘t take any realistic commitment, I just needs a change in your mind. When you feel anxiety in your actions, don’t care. I don’t want you to demonstrate that you don’t care, I want you to not care. There’s a big difference between showing and doing. You can still be a respectable person and respect other people while not giving a sh*t about the rules of society. I hope I have helped you with this. Keep going. P.S. Since this is my only post here I‘d like to recommend you 2 great books which really helped me on my journey: - „Models“ by Mark Manson (I originally bought this book to be more attractive to women but the book guides you through a internal development too. I highly recommend this book to women aswell) -„Can‘t hurt me“ by David Goggins (This book changed my life)', \"My first date was an absolute nightmare. I'm 25 and never had been on a date before because my SA is so bad, and now I see why I avoided it this long. There is this girl I like at work and I had my co-worker ask her to exchange numbers with me because of couse I couldn't do this myself. Then I waited for her to text me because of course I couldn't text her first. Then I managed to ask her out over text because I couldn't do it in person despite seeing her at work. Anyway, so to do the date itself. We went to this park with a trail and she brought her dog (I thought that would help, but it didn't) and it took about an hour or so to walk it. This couldn't have been any worse because all we could do for an hour is walk and talk. Now to where it all went downhill.. She had to lead the entire conversation, there would be long pauses of awkward silence and when I did talk it would come out completely different than I would have wanted it. Oh, and I couldn't make any eye contact so it was like I was ignoring her the whole time.. I had planned to take her out to eat after but that never happened and we just called it a night. She basically told me straight up she didn't have a good time. The worst part is now I work with her so I actively try to avoid her because I am so embarrassed. I know this was long and probably nobody is going to read it, but I feel so depressed and wanted to share this with somebody, anybody.\", \" What's the weirdest/most awkward thing you've done to avoid social interaction?. As an highly introverted and socially awkward person, I often take the stairs instead of the elevator just to avoid that uncomfortable small talk with neighbours I barely know.

I was thinking about my graduation and damn, it was was the most forgettable thing ever. While some were crying I was just thinking when the fuck I was gonna be out of there. As soon as we threw our hats to the air I went to my parents and told them that I wanted to leave, they said that I should be with my classmates and stayed because there was free food (which I didn't eat because I fucking hate to struggle in a crowd just for a piece of cake). While my parents (and everyone, including my classmates) were inside eating I went outside and waited until we left. Now that I think about it I think I didn't even say goodbye to any of my classmates. The worst part is that some fucking asshole decided it was a good idea to make it on a saturday at 10 am, I only went because my mom forced me, otherwise I wouldn't have even considered it. I don't know if this was supposed to be a very emotional and special ocassion but it definitely wasn't for me, I guess that's what happens when you hate to be around people and don't make any friends.\", 'I had a meaningful conversation with a stranger once..

Then there is to get willpower to fight that SA beast.  and#x200B; I had this doctor, therapist or what to call him and he recommended me to stay in the place he worked in, it had this extra care/service place for people with other diagnoses, mental problems. I did not have any of those but he recommended I used this to get social practice daily. Staff there helped me to get out several times daily when I was used to nothing like it. I got much better, my SA turned out to a much better level where I dared to go outside by myself (I always needed a caretaker with me where ever I went outside my home). At the same time I waited for my own apartment (it was planned to be given to me right after I came out this mental care place but nope..) and having this level of SA I thought \"eh, I\\'ll just wait for that apartment\". It took around 6 months and I did not know my SA level would drop through time. With that long wait my SA level had dropped to what it used to be. It was hell to move to this new place, it was right in the middle of town. I did not even dare to get my mail which was in this safe in the main room. If I had maintained my SA level I bet I would have dared to, and maybe even made a friend there. This was in 2014.

I've been unable to function normally in social situation since I was like 8. I never made any friends or had any social skills but I also didn't have a computer or anything at home back then so I still played outside with my sisters and brother (not with friends tho.) Then when I was 11 we moved house and got a computer. At first I just played the normal kids games but when I was 12 I started using sites like tumblr to express myself because I saw a lot of people on there who also had social anxiety or who were generally socially awkward. I got validation through likes and comments on social media so I didn't really make an effort to put myself out there irl because I didn't want to risk the rejection irl. Looking back now though, I realise that I shouldn't have depended on social media for my social interaction and I should have actually gone outside and tried to talk to people to build up my social skills. Now I'm fucked because I'm 18 and have the social skills of an 8 year old girl.

Then 5 minutes later walk past the opposite way and do the same thing with increased laughter. It doesn’t feel good being laughed at like that.

Today it was my turn to present, before I started, I had a regular heart rate and I was pretty calm to my surprise. But when it came time for me to stand up and present, it all went to shit.

Basically, I just finished an exam. After an extremely awkward encounter (what other kind are there, especially when my brain is this fried after my last exam) taking a group photo for some people who had just finished. I started walking home and one of my coursemates mentioned he was going to the pub next to the exam hall, didn’t think anything of it. As I was walking home, almost at my door, I came across two of my friends with another guy and they said they were going to the pub and after a brief pause one of them asked if I wanted to come. I realised that was why my other coursemate was going to the same place and my mind instantly built this narrative that they didn’t tell me about it because they didn’t really want me there and only offered because they bumped into me, so I declined. Maybe it’s a good thing I did as I’m knackered and would have found it very had to socialise, particularly with lots of people. But I’m not even sure that whole story that fell into place in a matter of seconds is even true. Maybe he just forgot to let me know they were going to the pub and offered when he saw me? But he did know I had that exam so surely he would have told me before if I was wanted there. It’s very possible it was intensional. I hate this constant confusion. I could be drinking a beer in the sun but instead I’m in my room I avoid so many things because I don’t want to be in a situation where I’m not really wanted there because of my social awkwardness. And the more I do this the more socially awkward I get. This obviously doesn’t put me in a good place for when I (very soon) leave uni and have to go to job interviews and stuff.

I’m 25, got this when I was 14-15 and it has rotten away so much of my life. I had no teenager years having fun with friends, I did not finish high school and I’ve not had a job yet. I’m isolated having big problems even taking a short walk in my neighborhood.', \" Social Anxiety mistaken for arrogance or ego.. So whenever I go outside and unfortunately meet some of my old classmates from high school they're all like you're such an egoistic person and you never text us or anything. When in reality they never tried to contact me either. Even the ones I wasn't even close with tell me like oh you're such an arrogant guy, you forgot about us..... Also I never talk to my relatives and they're like he's so rude, and they all hate me. I feel like I'm being blamed for something I'm not and I don't wanna be. I wanna go out,socialize,make friends but my anxiety and insecurities stop me from doing so and I feel even more anxious when everyone says things about me. \", \"Pls Help. I feel hopeless and unmotivated constantly. I try my best to have a positive mindset, but not being able to go outside and the amount of people who constantly insult me is taking its toll.

So I'm just finishing my first year of uni and like, I've barely interacted with my flatmates this year. I've been a complete hermit and I hate myself for it. But a couple months ago, I spoke to a girl from my flat on Snapchat a bit and we agreed we should hang sometime when we were both free from uni work, and we had a couple good conversations between then and now, but today we finally hung out and it was so nice. We went to the park and just sat in the sun and chatted and stuff, but I had such a nice time and I'm so fucking happy and proud of myself that I was able to overcome my anxiety after a year of being dominated by it. I was scared shitless all morning, terrified it'd be awkward or something would happen or whatever, but nothing went wrong at all. The conversation was fine, she had a good time, I had a good time, we were there way longer than I anticipated. I feel so proud of myself and happy that I made a friend. For the first time since moving to this city last September, I don't feel alone. If I can do it, you can do it. Go outside of your comfort zone. Try new things, even if they make you anxious. Especially if they make you anxious. \", \"My dad always has a horrible attitude. Ever since I was young I've always been the type to not really want to socialize. I'd always spend most of the time I had alone and at home. My dad has always been the person with a really shitty angry attitude over the smallest things. He's worked on it over the years and he's improved, however he still carries it since you can't really remove part of your already made personality. During summer I usually stay at home and go outside as much unless there's a good movie I want to see/to the store with my parents. I don't really have many friends in real life, even though I talk to a few people at school. I don't really like going out with them I prefer being on my own. I have a few good friends online which is surprising I'm closer to them than classmates. I normally voice call them daily and we play a few games together since we're the same age and known each other in the friend group for a few years. We all have the same interests in games and we met in our early childhood days of starting to play video games. I am 15 years of age, and my dad always wants me to turn my computer off at 9PM. When it's left on past 9PM he usually gets really mad which I find stupid because it's summer. I know I shouldn't stay up to 1-2AM which I don't want to I just want him to stop getting mad over stuff like that. He normally says it's because I spend a couple hours a day on it. I go to the gym daily especially over summer. I just don't know what's a good way I can maybe convince him that it's maybe time for me to be able to control my own sleep schedule? Do you guys have any good ideas how I can accomplish this? I had a therapist who told me I should stop being scared of my dad and be able to voice out my opinion and even my mom tells me that. It's just hard because his attitude makes it seem like he's going to get mad over me mentioning it.\", 'I dont feel sad or happy. I just dont feel anything. I have no personality.

I can’t relax', 'Social anxiety holding me back in both personal and professional life. Hi everyone, this may be a bit long, but I appreciate anyone who reads even most of this!  and#x200B; Anyway, I\\'m a 24 M living in a big city. And a social anxiety sufferer. My social anxiety isn\\'t physically crippling or physiological -- my physical symptoms are usually pretty limited -- but it\\'s mental and I am an expert in avoidance. I would even say I am a \\\\*very\\\\* social and outgoing person in \"comfortable\" environments (alcohol, bars, sporting events, with friends or people I trust, etc.), but when it comes to \"uncomfortable\" environments including putting myself out there and being alone doing it, I avoid them (joining clubs/sports teams, going to events, meeting new people, talking to people at bars, etc.) altogether.  and#x200B; My social anxiety stems from insecurity and a lack of self-confidence. I wasn\\'t beat up or anything as a kid, but I grew up being bullied, condescended toward, and made fun of for my lack of height at the time -- I was one of the shortest kids in school (I\\'m 5\\'8 now and have not been insecure about this in years) -- and for being skinny and small in general as a man in a society that often sees men like that as weak and a joke. Teachers told me I couldn\\'t audition for roles because of my height, kids my age made fun of me, and adults made snide comments. All of this contributed toward deeply ingraining into my head a fundamental insecurity. I wore sweatshirts during the summer and shirts at the beach because I had terrible body image issues. From the age of like 10. **Long story short, from an early age I was very insecure, had major body image issues, and terrible self-confidence and this contributed greatly to creating my social anxiety.**  and#x200B; **Fast forward to today.** I am still skinny and small and find that the women who are into me tend to be 2-3 years younger usually because I \\\\*do\\\\* look young and small for my age. Dating can be frustrating. But, I am going to the gym, I\\'m starting to feel more confident in my body, and I know that I have had a good amount of romantic opportunities, even if it has never worked out into a relationship. I feel good about myself, have become extremely self-aware of my own insecurities and how I projected them in the past, and in general I am content. But, I still cannot get over the avoidance of social anxiety. It\\'s ingrained into my head.  and#x200B; **It has prevented me from making more friends** in a new city -- the idea of doing a Meetup or joining a club is terrifying to me. And I just avoid doing that kind of thing altogether. **It has prevented me from, say, talking to women at a bar,** \\\\*even in\\\\* a drunken state when I feel good about myself. It just takes over and I tell myself I\\'m not attractive, that I\\'m going to embarrass myself, etc. It has essentially reduced my chances of meeting women to only on dating apps. **And it also has held me back in my career and what I want to do in life**. I\\'m a deeply political person but I can\\'t network. I can\\'t bring myself to go to happy hour\\'s by myself or join political clubs or anything. I simply cannot put myself out there alone into unfamiliar situations. The thought of being awkward or having no one to talk to or being seen as ridiculous or an idiot -- these things fill my head and so avoid these situations altogether.  and#x200B; I don\\'t want to look back five years from now and not have made more friends, not have taken a risk romantically by talking to someone I didn\\'t know, and not have truly tried to pursue my political dreams. I have gone to therapy lately but the appointments are few and far in-between (once a month at best) and while it has helped me become even more self-aware, it has not helped me with, well, changing my brain chemistry. And I don\\'t want to be resigned to thinking this is just how I am going to be. I am missing out on so many opportunities from friends to partners to career/hobbies. **Above all, I am frustrated that I have all the logical solutions to this problem (Who actually cares what people think of you?), but that does nothing for what feels like an innate reaction to unfamiliar situations**. **I can be confident one moment and then crumble the next. I get rejected in some form and it just feeds into a spiral.** **This is very long and I am rambling, but thought I would find friendly ears here. Maybe people in my shoes who have suggestions and have conquered (or struggle with) the same things I have. Feels nice to not be alone.**', \"I find a problem with every community I could become a part of. I'm 21 and this is something I struggle with a lot. It feels like most communities I have tried to be a part of have features around them that made me distance myself from being a part of that community. I understand that I am the problem in this situation and I'm probably overgeneralizing everything. Here are some examples: I enjoy casual gaming, but not enough to care about gaming news or events. I feel like a huge amount of people in the gaming community my age are overly edgy, rage a lot over games or are neckbeardy which scares me off. I also hate playing video games for hours on end, I get burnt out really easily and gamers usually like to have long sessions with each other. I drifted away from my gaming friends because the burnout from playing video games for hours at a time was too much for me. I enjoy hip hop and r andb, but a lot of the culture around this for my age is associated with people who smoke weed, drink, and go clubbing, which intimidates me as I don't like the loss of control associated with drugs and loud 'carefree' environments like clubs. I also feel like there's huge pressure to be on social media within this community. In high school I was friends with people who were into this community a lot and as they got older we drifted apart as they became clubbers and big on alcohol etc. I enjoy football, but I hate the competitiveness that comes with playing it (even socially, you'll get shouted at or made fun of for mistakes) and there is a hyper masculine/ drinking community stereotype associated with casual footballers my age. I also am terrible at football! I have always dabbled in and out of this community but as I was never very good, I didn't really get any respect, and I found playing a very high pressure scenario. All the above seem like immaturity problems, but there are other communities Ive tried to get into that I didn't have this problem with but I just didn't enjoy being a part of them. For example I have tried an art community, but I am not very good at art which made me embarassed whenever I went to the classes, and the way I think I naturally struggled to make and critique art. I also just felt very uncomfortable in this environment, which I think may be due to the fact that I'm not very passionate about art. I'm happy I at least tried though. I have tried a board game community, but I found it too nerdy for me, and I just didn't find any of the board games we played fun. I just didn't feel engaged enough and as passionate as the others were about the games, and the people in the group were all a lot older than me. I'm constantly looking for communities I can join which I will feel comfortable with. I am thinking maybe a running community. However I am worried that this problem is going to follow me everywhere since I seem to perfectionistic about who I be friends with. Like I already know I don't care about run times and stuff so I may feel out of place being surrounded by people who do care. If anyone else has dealt with this, it would be great to hear some advice. Thanks!\", 'How do I tell my mom about my social anxiety?. So I’m about to be 16 and don’t want social anxiety to ruin my social life at school this year too. It’s honestly been terrible and I want to get help from a therapist but I don’t know how to tell my mom. I have lots of friends at school but I can’t socialize at school. The only reason I have friends is because of my ps4 where I can talk without anxiety. I don’t know what my mom would think about me going to a therapist or even a doctor. She knows that I barely go outside and tries to get me to go to out but only with muslims cause she believes that other kids are bad for me. I’m anxious to tell her of my anxiety because she’ll say to “just go outside”. I was thinking that I should wait until I have a doctor’s appointment to mention my anxiety.', ' So coffee didn’t happen.. I’ll link to the original post, but long story short I asked a guy to coffee. Everything was going fine, but then he sort of dropped off of texting and snapping conversations, wasn’t really interested in the conversation, wouldn’t initiate etc. You know, all the regular *bad* signs. I left it a few days and then snapped him a pic of me at the pool (swimsuit pic lol) and was like “what are you up to?” And he opened it and never replied. So then I got embarrassed, and also a little panicky feeling like coffee would be super awkward and weird. He told me that he would text me the night before for a time etc., but that he might forget because he was super forgetful (implying I should reach out if he didn’t). And I came up with this plan, that if he reached out I would talk to him/go/plan etc, but I was not going to reach out myself. I just planned to let it die. And then he didn’t reach out. Surprise surprise. The time we were supposed to have coffee has come and passed, now I feel awful and down. I realize he’s not the only guy out there or anything obviously but it still sucks. I’ve just never really had luck with guys, like ever in my whole life, and so sometimes I get this harebrained idea to try to make things happen myself, and it always backfires.

To add onto this I’ve gotten very insecure about my body(im morbidly underweight) as a result I never go outside without my hoodie to hide my tiny ass arms. I’m literally starting to hate myself.

Its always \"how is it going\" or \"what you doing\" then convo finishes.. so awkward and bland and boring...im so uninteresting.. i have nothing to say to anybody. Im out of conversation. All my talks are open ended. Im really stressed out by texting girls online and not getting a single reply.. in where i live dating isnt allowed so i have to text girls even only for wanting be friends...i never talked to a women before face to face.. i wouldnt know what im supposed to say, at that time my mind would be empty and dont know what to start with... i never have had a best friend.. Im literally a man-child... i dont feel like doing anything at all.. but my mind is complex af right now. Idk what i am thiking or why im thinking these. I keep comparing my self to superheros in movies. How they are perfect and i am... I mean im so low and such a loser that i dont even know how to talk..... im awkward around girls too... im generally confused about women, men, life, religion, family, everything.. i hate everyone and everything too. I never put my mind to anything worthwhile Sometimes i think i have meant to be a loser for my entire life. I want to change it but idk how. I want to be cool smart funny intelligent assertive with sense of humour i want friends close ones too. I want a GF too.. but i will never achive a thing like this. I dont even have comebacks to any insult. I tell things that everyone knows. I dont have my own opinions or thoughts or even ideas. I cant even come up with a joke or insult or comeback. Im nothing. My mind is empty... people talk for hours i cant even talk for a few secs. Idk how to start convos maybe its just online chat that sucks the blood out of me. I cant even do a small talk. Idk how to ask questions about peoples interests... they tell what they are interested in it and i just say \"cool\" or thats interesting.. my convos are so dumb and dull and boring.. i cant attract beautiful intelligent women either. Im the worst human being in this earth by definition. Movies or tv shows make me sad cause ppl in there are.super cool super smart and rich and im a loser. I feel like im not worthy getting any women.. i feel like every girl is cooler than me. Feeling they are cooler than me. How my convos should be like ? Getting to know each other?? Who am i ? What do i do to make friends? Am a really sarcastic guy? Or a bland/boring guy? Who should i be when talking to others? How do i make people close to me? Maybe i should focus less on making friends online. Im worried so much about this.. im worried about what to say next. What do couples talk about everyday and never run out of things to talk about?? My questions are boring as hell. I just get yes or no answers... my convos are always generic.. i send 100 girls messages and i still dont get replied..am i just desperate or what. No one wants to hangout with me. Im so bad at everything. I feel like i dont exist. Im nobody. Everyone ignores me. Its like i want to be popular real bad just like my friends..idk how to stop trying My family always calls me a loser.. a man with no plans or future or skills. Im so lame. Im so annoying too. No one likes me. Im a nonsense and my talks are nonsense too. No wonder any cute girl would never put any effort in me. Its because i dont deserve it. I have nothing to offer. I have no personality. Im dumb. I never fit in.. And people get to me sometimes so easily. Im not really tough or assertive or a bastard that pushes away those who are mean to him. In texting while trying so much to make girls like me or value me or at least just say hello to me i try a lot and i turn out to be weird or boring or my talks are absolute nonsense... i dont know how to talk. Idk anything. How some guys text so little to girls and girls still be interested in them? I dont have that superpower. Im not fun or cool. Am a total loser with a retarded mindset and tottaly boring/bland. Im not a badass or cool kid or a guy that people take seriously. Im invisible and no one really respects me. I always put more effort in than others.. but no one puts any effort into me. What do i do to make people like me??? But my convos are always dry or boring or bland or i run out of interesting questions to ask.. i ask questions like an interview and most times just get a Yes or no.. no one cares about me or loves me or thinks im important.. im just a stupid invisible boring nice guy.. Idk how to be interested in people, idk how to make friends...im not even interested in my self. I hate my self.. Idk who i am, idk how to realize who i am, idk how to find out who i want to be? Some role model? Like who? James bond? What are convos suppose to be like? In real life and online?? I try really hard to make people laugh. It happens when i see someone being funny.. so i try to say something funny too. It turns out bad... I have spent so much of my life trying to be noticed/valued/heard.. and trying to get people to give me attention.. there is so much anger inside my towards my self and everything around me.. Im always one to text first guess im really needy and chase others approval and please people just to be my friend.. this is pathetic and idk how to fix it.. Im not the one who people love Im not the one that people chase I have no skills Im not anyones best friend I dont get invited to anything I dont have friends irl or a GF. I have no job either.. Im not loved by anyone, not important for anyone.. Im only nice or rude. Which both are dumb and arent really a quality. But being rude is better than being nice to girls...idk who to be. I only play soccer watch movies and listen to music. These are the 3 things i do nothing more... Im not creative or funny or intelligent or charming or cool or smart or confindent or charismatic like James bond.. im worthless and i have no qualities at all..i have no personality im like a robot..i have no humour or no orginality in me. Im too typical and so none orginal sooo generic. I have no ideas or thoughts or opinions on my own. Im not smart enough to create opinions or big ideas. Im not even smart enough to create a joke. I have no clinical thinking..im not good to anything. Im basically like a servent when i talk to girls.. and i can be fooled so easily.. i cant fool people either.. even for fun.. because im like a joke to people.. maybe im just mean.. maybe i have a really big ego.. i have really passive aggressive jokes too.. idk how to get to know people, i dont know how to know people.. Im jealous of people with a lot of friends.. and jealous of those who have banter with each other or calling each other nicknames.. im invisible.. I try really hard to make friends online its like i want people to fill the hole of emptiness inside me..all i been thinking about is getting a GF. Not sure if i want it but i feel like it will fix all my problems.. do i even have problems? Idk.. Im addicted to porn i can escape but then i havs nothing to do and idk what to do to self improvement.. Im jealous of people who got girls chasing them and girls interested in them, jealous of ppl who get attention.. like i used to be worried about likes and rts... I cant even win a fucking arguement im so brainless. I hate my self with passion. People love themselfs for 50 reasons but for me there is no reason.', '[LONG/VENT] My first 2 therapy sessions made me feel worse. What should I do?. 25 year old male, living with my mom alone. I\\'ve never worked in my life. Never been in a relationship. Haven\\'t had a friend IRL in 10 years, which is also the amount of time that I\\'ve avoided going outside entirely unless absolutely necessary (a handful of times.). Never really been diagnosed with anything, but I have really bad social anxiety for sure. Deep depression and personality issues, adhd, possibly autistic spectrum. Who knows. I\\'ve avoided going to therapy/doctors for my entire life due to my anxiety and negative thoughts. I would talk with people online and I would always say that I would never go to a therapist, and thought it would never help me. This was based on brief interactions that I\\'ve had with therapists online, and me looking up stuff about therapists on the internet. Recently, other physical health issues of mine got so bad that I had to go to the ER, which lead me to going to a general doctor, which lead me to finally try to find a therapist. Problem is, I\\'m poor. I only have free insurance from the government, and there\\'s only a handful of therapists in my area that take it. I looked at their profiles. A lot of them honestly made me upset and uncomfortable, so I tried calling the ones that I thought I might get along with. Every. Single. One. said they weren\\'t accepting new clients. Which lead me to my only other option, going to a \"health center\" or something like that, dunno what it\\'s called, but it\\'s the place where courts send people who have drug addictions and stuff. I didn\\'t really have an option and they basically just automatically assigned me a therapist. I felt very uncomfortable with the idea of it. I don\\'t get along with people very well in general. I have a very low tolerance, but I\\'m so horrified of expressing my negative and rude thoughts out of fear for rejection. I really wanted to be able to choose someone that I thought would fit me well, but I still forced myself to give it a try anyways. I had this picture in my mind of how it would play out. I would come in, sit down. He would ask me questions and try to figure me out, understand my issues. I would try to open up, but mostly fail because I\\'m so anxious and I\\'m really bad at expressing myself. He would give hid input, professional advice, or \"help\", that would just upset and trigger me because I feel like it\\'s just generalized advice for \"normal\" people that\\'s not addressing the root cause of my issues. I would reject the help, repeatedly, until the therapist got sick of my rejection that they got rid of me and sent me to someone else. The fear of being rejected like that is so great that... It just makes it so hard to express my real thoughts and what I think. Anyways, what actually happened when I went to therapy... I guess it was what I expected and also not what I expected... what I expected was to be asked more questions, like he would make attempts at trying to figure me out or understand me, and that didn\\'t happen very much. I tried talking about some of my issues anyways, and he said a lot of things that really upset me deeply, but I didn\\'t feel comfortable expressing out of fear of upsetting him/him rejecting me. There was a lot of \"Learn to love yourself\"/accept yourself/accept negative beliefs/be mindful/cbt kind of comments and ideas that he said. I don\\'t know. I don\\'t really feel it addressed my issues very well. I really didn\\'t want to go the second time, despite the first one making me feel worse. I hoped that after going to the first session, that I would have just a tiny bit of relief, and a tiny bit of hope that MAYBE I could improve and work towards getting better, but it left me feeling more hopeless. I didn\\'t want to go the second time, but it was more of the same basically. It\\'s really hard for me to recall most of the things he said as I have a really bad memory, but most of it upset me and I suppressed my triggered feelings of anger and upset, again out of fear of being rejected and referred away. He talked about quicksand in analogy to struggles, and about how the more you fight against it, the more you sink, and you just need to calm down and just accept the issues and just let them be there. My mind screamed at me, NO!!!!!! I need help with my issues. I can\\'t just accept this. I can\\'t accept how of a miserable spot I\\'m in right now. I\\'m so fucking hopeless. I want to improve, not just sit around accepting and sitting in my misery. He talked about how he believes that everyone is fundamentally \"good enough\" and \"Okay\", which at my core I deeply disagree with. I definitely don\\'t feel good enough, and have so many areas that I need to improve upon, and need help with improving on. I feel like he did more talking than I did as well, and that he didn\\'t really want to seem to ask much questions or try to figure me out... is that normal? I want my issues to be addressed and I don\\'t feel like they are being addressed. And I don\\'t know if it\\'s just my anxiety, but the interactions with him were so awkward and unbearable, but that\\'s just how I am in social situations in general, all social interactions feel awkward and unbearable to me so I don\\'t know if that was him or me. I scheduled a third appointment coming up this Friday, in hope that maybe it will somehow turn around and change, and start slowly helping me instead of making me feel worse and more hopeless when I go. I don\\'t really feel have any options. I\\'m so absolutely stuck in life right now. I\\'m so hopeless and I don\\'t know what to do. I feel like I need help, but so far I don\\'t feel like this is helping, and I don\\'t fee like it could help, and I don\\'t know what could possibly help me. All I know is that this isn\\'t so far and I don\\'t know what to do. I don\\'t know how therapy is supposed to go in the first place, or what to look out for, or what to expect from it, but I should feel like I\\'m getting SOME kind of benefit out of it, right? Is it normal to feel this negative towards it at first? I know how unstable and negative I can be... maybe it\\'s just me getting in my own head, but maybe therapy isn\\'t right for me and maybe I should jump ship? I just don\\'t know what to do. Please give me some advice.', 'Little kids staring at me. Today I was walking at the park and I saw this little girl just staring at me for about 5 seconds in a (looked like a mad look). So why are they staring and it makes me really uncomfortable', ' How to not run out of things to talk about? Espically online??.

', \" Does anyone else really wanna move out of their parents house, but just can't?. I've been living in a small village in Wales my entire life now, and I've always hated it. I have alot of non-anxiety problems with it, like the constant loud noise and being woken up by my neighbor's gardener every week to mow a small patch of grass, and the garbage internet connection. But my anxiety problems with this place are alot worse, like not being able to have any privacy. Or feeling like you're so disconnected from the world because you can't even take a bus into town. I wanna just move out so bad...but I can't. I'm so afraid of the crushing loneliness. I'd love to have a roommate or something but it terrifies me living with a completely new person. My family are away for the week rn and it pretty rough being in a big house on my own. Its pretty much being like in solitary confinement, you can't leave. Time's like these just depress me, I seriously worry I'll just never get better. Sorry if this is a bit of a ramble but can anyone relate at all? It would be nice to know Im not alone with this at least \", 'Girl at work. I don\\'t get crushes often but there\\'s a new really attractive girl at work that I recently got a huge crush on :(. I think I may or may not have overheard that she might be dating someone and so I\\'m like 90% she is but not 100% certain.  andnbsp; She\\'s so incredibly cute and I really wish I was able to talk to her and express myself a bit better around her. I\\'m extremely shy, and have such terrible social skills, and socially anxious but like a high functioning socially anxious these days, and all my hobbies are introverted and aren\\'t too social. She\\'s the complete opposite - outgoing, enjoys talking and meeting people, and honestly really fun, funny, and easygoing.  andnbsp; I\\'m never able to start conversations with her because I never know what to say and I\\'d love to even just befriend her if she isn\\'t single. She\\'s initiated random conversations with me several times, and I always respond positively, and sometimes it even seemed like she would go out of the way to talk to me. One time I was walking forward and she walked right past me and I was gonna say hi awkwardly like I normally do, but she walked right by, then she turned back and said \"hey how are you doing kevin?\", and she seemed really interested. I always just default to saying \"good how are you\", and she ended up saying \"i\\'m doing really good\" and honestly just seemed super excited but the conversation kind of just ended since I didn\\'t know what else to say and she was like awkwardly walking backwards back to her desk while tripping and regaining balance on her foot lol. We also went on an after-lunch walk together and we had a really fun chat (we both just happened to go out walking at the same time).  andnbsp; Every time I see her when we walk by like going to the cafeteria, at most I just awkwardly say hi and that\\'s it. I feel like i might really appear uninterested to her when we talk since I don\\'t say much, and maybe she doesn\\'t like talking to me that much anymore because I may be boring or too quiet or awkward. I\\'m at the point where I\\'m literally thinking at the start of the day what I should say to her if I see her aside from \"hey how\\'s it going, good, you? good\", and literally overthinking the shit out of the conversations and they always end up not happening. I\\'m also literally just trying to time my post-lunch walk right when she finishes lunch so it\\'s like \"oh hey you\\'re going for a walk now too? me too no way!!\" and I feel super creepy lol. I feel so lovesick (I think is the word)... and it especially sucks as someone with social anxiety where you really wanna talk to someone but are too anxious to, and honestly I\\'m just so lonely that I feel hopeless when I \"fail\" to just be the way I want to. And I also realize how hopeless this sounds since she most likely has a boyfriend, and I\\'m obviously overthinking everything, and most likely nothings going to come of it. I pay attention to how she acts to me and am hopelessly hoping and overthinking everything she does that might indicate that she possibly likes me too, when it\\'s incredibly unlikely. I honestly feel like this same thing with very similar people has happened twice in college, and now again, and the feeling kind of just sucks.', 'When will things ever get better? [rant]. I’ve never spoken out about my problems, and I’m not sure why I’ve come to reddit of all places but I’m just really hoping someone will listen to me and maybe understand... Basically my entire life has been revolved around making my mother happy, or her dictating what I can and can’t do. She always emailed my teachers when I was in elementary, middle, and even high school. She didn’t believe I could say what I needed to say or get the help if I didn’t understand something. She had an app that would show her my grades, and anytime I’d get a bad grade I knew that she was going to scold me. Now I fear that I will fail, and I do not know how to cope with failure at all. Whenever I’ve had boyfriends in the past she has always hovered over us 24/7. At 18 I decided to go to the movies with my best friend (he happens to be a guy but our relationship is strictly platonic). In the middle of the movie she turns on the find my iphone alert. Everyone in the theater turns to me because the alert sound is so loud. I have to run outside because I’m so embarrassed. I answer the phone and she’s yelling at me because apparently the map showed that I wasn’t where I told her I was (so she was spying on my location..). We argued and she made up some dumb excuse for why she embarrassed me.. saying the weather was bad and that she was concerned, but that it was my fault because I left when I knew the weather would be bad. I’m 19 now. She has access to all my emails (except one that I use for reddit) and social media. I now have social anxiety to the point where my mom has to do everything for me. Anytime our opinions don’t match or I give her “tough love” she tells me she feels betrayed by me. When I order food at restaurants I either let her order for me or I look to her for approval to go ahead and order. It is not even on purpose, it is just habit. When I’m at the doctors office I will explain my issues the best that I can, but she always has to add something because my explanation wasn’t good enough. When I get bad grades, I have a panic attack. I ask myself “what will mom do when she finds out?” I’ve never had a job because I’m too scared to work. My mom is obsessed with my weight. I am 130 pounds and 5 foot exactly. I’m a little on the thicker side but I’m not fat. There have been times when shes grabbed the fat on my arms, my least favorite body part, and said I don’t want my arms to look like “chicken legs” or something like that. I actually don’t normally hate my body, but every time she points something out I start noticing and hating it. Recently I went on antidepressants for my social anxiety. It’s only been about a week on them so I don’t expect much difference and there hasnt been yet. I know SSRI’s can take a while to work. I have eaten pretty normally, but my mom is obsessed with weight gain. I know they can make you gain weight, but its like thats all she talks about. These meds make you really tired so i havent been motivated, but she is forcing me to walk in the heat with her. Ive been telling her how tired they make me, but its like she doesnt understand. So I walked with her and afterwards felt so nauseous that i thought i was going to throw up (and i already have once). I don’t have anymore friends. I haven’t drove my car once this entire summer, and I hardly leave the house. Somedays I feel like a miserable excuse for a person, and this has made me think suicidal thoughts. The other day my mom actually told me that I don’t have depression because its not as bad as someone else she knows. No, maybe I don’t have “depression” but that doesn’t mean I don’t contemplate death. Before I started this medication I thought about death every single day and never told anyone. I love my mom, but this is the result of helicopter parenting. Now, I can’t even order food for myself or call the doctors office to set up an appointment. I would never want my child to go through what I now go through on a day to day basis. I feel like I’ve regressed back to infancy, always looking to my mom for approval. Raising my hand in class is an improvement for me. And that is just sad. At the same time my mom is nagging me to join clubs and make friends and I’m still trying to figure out how to raise my damn hand in class without having a panic attack. But no improvement is ever good enough. If I told her I raised my hand in class for the first time in 6 months she’d tell me that I need to force myself to join a club instead. Then I’m called too sensitive because I regress back into my shell after her statement. And apparently, we don’t believe in congratulating someone for little things like raising their hand because thats nothing. I am going to have to see my school counselor once the semester starts. I cannot keep living like this. This isn’t a reality to me. There is no way this is what my life has become. I have so much to say, and so many dreams of my own. I want to be successful. I don’t want to be figuring out how to be normal functioning human when I’m only months away from being 20.. I’m sorry if this whole thing sounds very melodramatic. I guess it is going to be dramatic for me... i’ve been dealing with it for at least 7 years now. 7 years of social anxiety that has gotten worse and worse over time. I might end up deleting this, idk. I just needed to write this somewhere. I feel so incredibly frustrated and yet completely numb at the same time. I don’t know what to do.', 'Can you give me the strength to get off my phone and tell people I wanna go to bed?. We’ve just run a 10 km, and I don’t feel like talking or swimming.

But I suppose I’m kind of boring rn.', 'Became too Feral to Socialize?. Well I am 23, have had a lot of bullying until HS where standing up for myself (in a soley verbal but overly aggressive manner) landed me in juvenile hall and probation. Followed by a terrible relationship that caused deeper wounds. I\\'ve had tons of therapy and psychiatry and have had around 300mg of seroquel makes me alright to finally be outside in just my neighborhood walking my dog; as well as some (legal) ketamine therapy. While I push myself into slightly social situations (conversing at a brewery after a few pints or someone whilst sober and walking said dog). The moment I see people that have some sort of regular social comradere, i frankly lose my shit. I don\\'t flip in public nor does it hit me immediately. I think along the lines of, \"isn\\'t it nice to have a friend\" or, \"they look like they\\'re having fun\" But then I come home and think of how nice it was outside and how wrong my assumptions are of people being shitty to me because of those repeated interactions. And all I ever feel is completely alone, other people have friends and memories where all I ever received was pain. And i know that isn\\'t a template for everyone else. But all that I feel is just despair, crushing lonliness, grasping to a thread type of loneliness. And then I fly into an interpersonal rage where I\\'m the dumbass for trying to even go in public because of these immediate feelings.

About a week ago I made a rant post about my worst day ever and that day doesn't even compare to how bad today was. A girl from my very small friendship group left school to go to college and usually I go out for lunch with her and another friend. But today was the first day she wasn't there and there was so much awkward silence between me and my other friend even though I would consider her my best friend. Our group originally had 4 people in in but one person left to sit with another group (I still talk to her at break and in some classes we have together). Anyways the girl that I thought was my best friend told me at lunch today that the friend that left for another group wants her to sit with them now but not with me and she said yes. Now I have no one to sit with or talk to at all and I'm going to have to walk home at lunch so I don't look like I have no friends (even though I actually don't). I wouldn't mind going home but it's a 20 minute walk there and we only get an 50 minutes for lunch which means that i'll have to walk home, stay there for 10 minutes then walk back. I know it seems pathetic that that's my worst day ever but it really is. I thought I was alone before but now I'm even more alone. I don't know what to do.\", \"I encountered this problem at the beginning of my school year. I'm a senior (17) and we have separate lunch periods in my school. In one period, I know no one, and in another is every person that I know. I got the former, unfortunately. Whenever I was sitting at a table or outside sitting on some steps, I wouldn't eat because I just didn't feel comfortable. Fortunately, I switched a particular class and got my lunch period switched. A few years back, during my freshman year it was even worse because I knew absolutely no one, and couldn't bear anyone seeing me alone, so I ate alone in the bathroom. I saw a whole bunch of freshman during the first few weeks eating alone, and even now almost halfway through the year I still see a handful of people eating alone. It makes sense to not want to eat alone though, because like you've maybe heard before, eating is supposed to signify that you're comfortable.\", ' I tried tinder before but no luck. Probably because im just not attractive. Im trying OKCupid now, and tinder again. Made them today. So far so shit, but I didnt exactly expect a fucking miracle that soon. I dont know of any fucking clubs near me, and the park probably not the best time of year for that. I tried Meetup but Im not sure where to start there are so many fucking groups idk which to pick or what. Definitely not going to do yoga but I get what youre saying when you made that point. \"Putting myself into situations\" is where im at a loss. Youd think me going to the gym and being on the train every day would be one but I guess not. Gym more so than the train. And I\\'m not sure Ill meet someone eventually if I was unable to do so in school. And I dont evne know what fucking girls im interested in if i never had a gf i have no basis really. Just no hyper feminists or annoying people. And oddly enough, the few okcupid profiles I browsed, several of them were hyper feminists, just my fucking luck. ', \" I go out to the city alone. Sure it feels a bit awkward, when you're there, not smiling just kind of derping and you see literally everyone being with a group of friends or couples having fun, singing, laughing... And if anyone in their joyous mood would approach you you despise the fake smile you must utter to fit in... I know I cried on my way back home two years ago when I did that the first time. Last time I was just derp. This year...I don't know. I'll go, take pics, and just won't care hopefully. Hey, at least I'm outside eh? Better alone among people than alone in solitude.. \", \" I listened to podcasts more towards the beginning of my journey to conquer my SA. On long walks to errands, and whilst power walking for exercise. The podcasts I listened to were self-improvement, social-anxiety, and motivation related. I think they all got me started on the right foot. Just hearing another human's perspective on how it was possible to change and hearing stories of how people improved themselves gave me the motivation I needed to believe that I could too. Once my life started rolling and becoming busier, I started listening to them less since I felt like I had gotten all the value I needed from them and I had stopped learning new information. I began listening to music instead. \", \"Right after college I totally freaked out. I couldn't even make the 5 minute walk to the corner grocery store. I stayed in my apartment for weeks and weeks at a time. I couldn't make phone calls or answer the phone. I gained probably 60 or 70 pounds. I would just play The Sims all day long. Hours and hours, eat, watch tv, and take many naps. I was just done. I eventually went and got some therapy (mostly CBT), and it helped a lot. I have two kids, a house, my husband, a job, and can pretty much force myself to get through things like work meetings and teaching things to co-workers now. It's still hard, and I know I'm one of the office weirdos, but I'm in a way better place than I used to be.\", '24M and extremely fearful for my future. Hey reddit, these last two weeks have been utter hell for me. My 24th birthday was two weeks ago from tomorrow and I celebrated it without anyone close to me. It was at that moment that I realized I needed to step up and actively combat my anxiety for my life to have any chance of improving. Still, I have a few fears: * I only have one close friend irl at the moment and therefore, I joined two meetup groups in an attempt to establish better connections. Ostensibly, I’m a nerd and a gamer, but I fear that my potential new friends will judge me for not getting to play many games growing up and will think I’m practically an old man for my age. * I’m starting to date via apps such as OKCupid and did manage to secure one. I’m scared my dates will judge me for having relatively little sexual experience. (I’ve only had sex a few times) I’m also scared they will judge me for my living situation (more on that below). * I live with my parents still, since my line of work is hard to break into (Writing). I did secure an internship from home recently, which has the potential to move into full time work. I’m terrified that a potential partner will judge me for this. * I’ve come to the realization this last year that I’m fairly happy with only a close friend or two, yet I believe even an introvert should get out of the house semi-regularly. Can I balance both the loner and involved lifestyles? * I’m trying to lose a lot of weight and so far have succeeded. I cut out all junk food, soda, alcohol and fried foods and don’t eat meat three days a week. I exercise by jogging 5 miles a day. * I’ve re-entered therapy, since it’s extremely beneficial to my well-being. Am I too old to gain a decent social life, partner and job? I mentally feel like a teenager rather than a 24 year old man and fear that I can’t make up for lost time. My only choice is to try now to secure a possibly better future, yet I fear I’ll fail in spite of my efforts. Any success stories?', \" SA in its purest form. The only way to change it is to keep saying hello to people despite your SA making you not want to and to change your thinking patterns. Changing your reaction from negative to positive, or at least to neutral is essential. Recently I've been able to laugh at myself a lot more, awkward interactions just amuse me now. Naturally I am pessimistic so just trying not to give too much of a fuck is all I can do to be able to go outside or talk to people again lol. Just keep trying, exposure therapy works. \", ' I\\'m also in my second year of college and feel pretty much the same. I don\\'t have friends, so I don\\'t really go and hang out much. There\\'s all these things I want to do like go to the soccer and basketball games, attend local concerts, or even just hang out around campus, but all that requires friends to have a good time. Every time I attempt to do anything I would like to enjoy, I end up feeling shitty for not having anyone I\\'m close with, so I therefore just feel like \"what\\'s the point\". I must admit I\\'m not an expert on avoiding feeling inadequate myself, and I\\'m sorry I don\\'t have much advice to give, as I\\'m working on that too. But I just wanted to let you know there are others going through very similar situations, especially in college I would imagine since many people leave friends they had in high school or their hometown etc. Sometimes I wish there was a club for lonely people so that they eventually make friends. I would start that club, but I\\'m way too nervous and scared to do it. ', \"Yes. 21, quit college last year, quit my job on November. I don't really go anywhere, just bored at home all day. Some days I'd rather not eat than go outside to get food.\", \"A bit, but for me it's running, sports, being in close proximity with 2+ people where we stand up in front of each other or direct 1-to-1 eye-contact moments. Moments when physical contact plays in. It's debilitating.\", \" I just sometimes can't find what to talk about, especially with my girl friends and only saying hi to them only makes them think I'm boring and I am not really worth to talk with. I almost never got invited to hang around outside or to birthday parties in my life, all I do is sit at home infront of my computer all day. All of my classmates don't care even slightly about me and pretend as if I don't exist at all. This hit home :( Idk what's wrong with us \", \" Sure, most of the time I get a feeling that I'm not even part of the society. Everywhere outside I go it seems like people are pushing me out of there. Really drags me down. Of course it's partially just in my head and my anxious behaviour does the rest, but that doesn't really matter. \", ' Usually just gaming, drawing, reading stuff on the internet, taking the dog out for a walk, and occasionally going for a jog! ', 'I\\'m sorry. I think I\\'m in somewhat of a similar situation. I met this girl on a college trip and she started talking to me, *forced* herself on me (in a good way). It was obvious she was very interested in me, and I got interested in her too. I added her on Facebook after that school trip and she messaged me the next day, saying that she had seen me leaving school but I was already too far away. We chatted for a slight bit and then she said her class had ended she was leaving school. I just said \"ok, talk to you later\" or something along the lines. In reality she wanted me to tell her to meet up, considering that I was free, at home and so was she, free, leaving school. That was the end of our conversation, period. Over the next few weeks/months I kept seeing her at school seeing as we had similar schedules. We\\'d say hi and she\\'d always chat me up. At first we\\'d talk for 5-10 or more minutes. That faded to just saying hi, to not even acknowledging (or rather avoiding) her most times, even though the only thing I thought about while at school was seeing her. That went on for an entire year. The next school year started and for some reason I told my about all this and he, obviously, said how much of a dumbass I for not making a move. So I decided I had to confront her, which just so coincided with her birthday. I messaged her at night on Facebook, saying happy birthday. She responded early in the morning, said thank you and that she was heading up to the university. I, as well, had a class so I said I\\'d see her there. I saw her there and we talked for what seemed like an hour. At the end of it, I just confronted her about what had happened, asked her if she was expecting me to make a move (which I obviously knew the answer to, and it was yes), she said yes. Asked her if she\\'d be down to try to get things going now and she agreed. She had another class and I didn\\'t so I left for home and messaged her as soon as I got there. We talked for the entire day, until she went to her birthday party where she wouldn\\'t have access to a phone or internet. We kept talking non-stop every day, and not in a friend kind of way. It was obvious we were getting together. We met up. Texted. Talked. Met up again. Dated for like 3 weeks or a month and while I was very nervous at times, it was the best weeks of my life. I still remember her touch. Her kissing my cheek, my neck. After that she suddenly texts me saying she feels the relationship is heading towards a friendship rather than a girlfriend/boyfriend type of a situation, and that was due to me not showing enough affection, love. An *entire year* of being obsessed with her, finally mustering up the courage to confront her, us getting together only for it to fall apart so quickly absolutely *devastated* me. I was dead. Dead. We agreed on being friends, and we kept in touch. Talked on Facebook and met up from time to time. While I obviously still had feelings for her, and she was aware of it, it wasn\\'t too bad. Yes I was sulking at times, but I was getting by. There were times where I didn\\'t really even think of her that much. - And then this Friday...We decided to meet up because she messaged me saying she missed me a ton (I had seen her over coffee two weeks prior). We met up near our school, walked around for about an hour, then went to a bar where a friend of mine works and drank, but not a lot. Just got tipsy. We probably spent 3-4 hours there, talking non-stop. Then I took her home (which is pretty far away from mine). We sat outside her house at 1am talking and talking. It felt exactly like the times when we were together. And that, I think, was the final nail the coffin. Experiencing a situation so similar to the ones when we were dating brought it *all* back. I\\'ve had my moments of depression, usually a day or two, but it\\'s never been this bad. I am extremely depressed and see no reason to live at all (not even considering suicide or harming myself). I can\\'t get back with her, but I can\\'t get her out of my head either. *All* I think about is her. The very first thought, every single day I wake up is her name. I don\\'t see cutting her off as an option either because of two reasons. One, I *do* want to just be friends with her if being a couple is not an option because I get along with her more than anyone else I\\'ve met in my life. And more importantly, two, not being in contact with her doesn\\'t seem to make me lose affection for her. I had almost zero contact with for an entire year and I was still madly in love. I\\'m sorry for such a huge post and seemingly hijacking yours, OP, but I really had to vent, even if no one reads this and also, hopefully, you realize you\\'re not alone. Please feel free to message me.', ' A park down the sreet where people like to get strung out and rob or get robbed. Not much man.

I didn't go to college, I never had a girlfriend, I lost all my friends due to my anxiety, I work from home so I rarely go outside and don't meet people. It hurts so much seeing happy couples in public and thinking to myself that I problably will never be able to achieve that due to my inexperience and anxiety. But remember that you are not alone. There are probably milions of people like you in the world. I know this sucks so much and I'm so tired of loneliness, but you have to have high hopes and pray for the best. Don't be pesimistic all the time. I'm here with you! \", \" Yes. It's gotten worse as the years progressed because before I was able to at least hang out with friends and go to soccer practice but now I have absolutely nothing. \", 'While I was always the shy and quiet kid, I think I would have grown out of that if it weren\\'t for an experience I had when I was 16/17. I went to the gaeltacht (irish speaking summer camp, 3 weeks only speaking irish away from home), when I was 13-15, and it was an amazing experience. I made new friends from all over the country, fell in love with the language, laughed so much every day. We stayed in houses and in each house was 1-2 leaders which were super bubbly talkative people who had to bring us out of our shell, break the ice in the early days, make sure we didn\\'t speak english, and they also ran daily activities. I knew I was shy but I wanted to be a leader and I thought if I didn\\'t know anyone then I\\'d be able to be that talkative and bubbly. When I was 16, I went as a leader. Everyone was SO SO extroverted, and because we were being \"evaluated\" by our superiors, being watched to see how well we mixed and interacted with other people, I got stage fright and didn\\'t talk to anyone. It was horrible, I felt so ashamed of myself for thinking I could do this and for being the only one who was shy. They must have been thinking \"what the hell is she doing here\". Long story short, none of the other leaders liked me. Like, they hated me. They\\'d talk to me and I\\'d be super quiet and they\\'d do the \"okaaaaay\" and their eyes would dart around and smile at someone when they talked to me. They also gave me grief one day because this boy asked me out, they were making fun of me, which hurt because the girl who was laughing at me was once my leader when I was a student, and I used to be the type of kid who would idolise and have faith in people. This experience broke that. We have one day where parents visit and most people go to a neighbouring town for lunch with them, I saw the other leaders and said \"Hi!!\" and they blanked me. To give context, this wasn\\'t a \"job\", leaders tend to form a close knit group, and I was outside of this. We had a day out to the cinema and there was no room on the bus so I had to go in a teachers car. The teacher shouted into the bus \"who wants to come with me and aoiphes in the car?\", no one moved. Anyway, I don\\'t know why exactly but my faith in others and more importantly myself broke, and is still broken. I actually blocked the experience out, I used to think about it at night and literally sweat and cry and push it out of my mind - it was humiliation, 3 straight weeks of it. I\\'m leaving specific bits out because they\\'re hard to describe but a lot of my flashbacks were of peoples expressions of suppressed laughter anytime I spoke to them. Or another leader rolling her eyes at me for not being good enough. It was like, you know when you do something silly by accident in front of people, and you think about it for years but the amount you think of it decreases with time? Well it\\'s like that, only happening continuously for 3 weeks. I honestly think I got PTSD from that experience. It took me years to allow myself to think about it, and it was painful. My description probably doesn\\'t make it sound that bad, but it was just things happening over and over again that confirmed for me that I was a failure and everyone hates me. Learning negative things about yourself one after the other with no time to process. It\\'s been better lately. Sometimes I think about it without cringing. Again, this probably sounds like a relatively normal experience but it was just overwhelmingly negative and honestly ruined my life.', 'So you really think that even with acute acne and so much scars on my skin (from the acne) isn\\'t repulsive? I\\'ve been trying to get that off me for more than 10 years now (I\\'m 22 M) and its still there. I tried like 20 different creams with no visible change, some of them even made it a bit worse. I even consulted a dermathologist who prescribed me strong pills against that. However, one side effect from that, which I wasn\\'t aware of but my parent were, was depressio, and eventually suicidal thoughts (which happenned when I was around 15-16). And its not like I\\'m ugly. I\\'d be considering myself handsome if it wasn\\'t for all of this, but I just consider myself \"meh\". I mean, nowadays its mostly scars, but I still have a bunch of red markings everywhere on my cheaks, neck, shoulders, back, chest which look like I have a lot of acne, all that since the skin in the scars is so thin that you can see the red of my blood more easily. But most women around my age probably think I\\'m disgusting and unclean because of all that, and thats not the case. I take 3 showers a day, brush my teeth after every meal when I get the chance to, so I\\'m clean and smell good, and my teeth are white, my hair looks clean, I shave... As for my shape, I look fit even though I don\\'t exercise (except this weekend and yesterday where I started biking again to get myself in a better shape). I\\'m not thin and I don\\'t look chubby. I look healthy. Its just the freaking scars and acne which probably looks disgusting. I would imagine I would repulse girls just for that single fucking problem. And thats probably why I have never been in a relationship, gotten laid nor even gotten my first kiss. And its not that I have a bad personnality either. The few girls I know told me they love my personnality since I\\'m a funny and caring guy, but they most likely would never date me. And my crush is even part of those girls (I\\'m planning to try to do something about that crush later this summer, a.k.a ask on a date).

The main thing that has affected my confidence and which turned shyness to social anxiety was this  last time I tried to fulfill a goal like this I ended up being told I was the complete opposite of what the role needed and not to come back, I did not do a good job. It was a job where I was a leader at a camp.

I can go to uni fine, I can have a presentation in front of a small group (anxious, but not too much), I can talk to people at work, I can go outside on the street without feeling anxious (only sometimes I do). So I'm betting if they say you had SAD at the hospital, then you must have had it. If your current psychologist does not agree, ask why and correct her if she's wrong about something about you. Be ready to see why you don't have it any more...or explain why you think you have it, etc. And if it doesn't seem right to you, you can always make an appointment with some other psychologist.\", \" I love working out by myself though, I've become so accustomed to my solitary lifestyle that I enjoy most things exclusively on my own.

I'm mostly nervous about articulating myself properly, I tend to be scattered when I'm out of my comfort zone.

Either that, or maybe if there's a holiday fair happening where you live, where you can do a bunch of different stuff and get to know each other a little bit better, would also be a nice alternative. \", \"Trying to find out the development of my social anxiety + depression. Hey guys, I've been anxious and depressed enough that I can't take it anymore, when I was the age of 0-14 I was a funny, very social, empathious fun kid. I always had friends, always was a part of everything and everyone recognized me for my laughing. Untill I hit my puberty ( not the reason why I'm anxious I think ) since that time I got even scared to open the door, I still don't have a job ( I'm 16 now ) and I'm currently in wait for my new school which I'm 2 months later then everyone else. Just because I canceled my other school since I was too anxious of finding a internship work place. I still only have old friends from the time when I was 'myself' and no new ones. I've always been very hyper since I was a kid and then my parents decided to diagnose me and turned out I had ADHD. It dind't bother me at that time. I do speak to my parents but not very much. Especially not about my feelings which I don't do with barely anyone. I dissapoint them alot with my anxious feelings for example the one from when I needed to find the internship work place. My mom keeps saying that I'm anxious because I have been judged by everyone my whole life and I know she is right but its not only that, I have also been taking Ritalin for a few years and from that moment everything changed, one day when I felt very anxious after 30 minutes of taking my Ritalin. I was in school at lunch break just with a bunch of friends because I wasn't having those anxious issues then, but I felt very depressed and anxious then and I also later called my mom asked if I could go home because I was feeling sick. I dind't mention that I was anxious to her. Next day I woke up and again took my dose of Ritalin ( I'm not gonna call it medication ) I felt exactly the same as the day before so I called my mom again and asked if I could go home. I still dind't tell about the anxious and negative thought I had. From that moment I wasn't feeling myself untill this day. I am feeling so tired, nothing makes me happy and I just feel so fucking miserable and anxious about even doing the smallest things. The worst thing is that I KNOW I can be myself because I have been in the past, but I don't know how or what to do. I'm also using little doses of sativa or hybrid strains of weed ( I vaporize them ) and it does really help for my ADHD to calm down my brains but it still doesn't make me feel myself happy from how I used to be. Obviously I still have some days where I feel happy but those only happen like once in a month . I also once was out for dinner with the whole fam and I was feeling very drowsy and just not active but I brought my filled vaporizer ( dry herb vaporizer ) with weed. So I vaped outside and I was myself again, I was talking to my fam and it was like I was reborn again. When I got home I was so happy and mostly proud, I later said to my mom what I did when I went outside and she already knew I smoke and shes okay with it as long as I don't get addicted and she also was a bit happy because she really saw the diffrence, its not always when weed works like that. But when I'm with friends and I smoke I always feel very comfortable around them and have a good time. They mostly make me forget to look at my phone so thats a good sign. I really want to feel like how I used to because most people liked me then alot. I also stopped growing from when I was using the Ritalin and last year I have grown so much from the moment when I stopped using it. I feel like ritalin fucked up my serotonin receptors because I know alot about all drugs. I know that Ritalin is in the same family as speed which makes it possible that it fucked up my serotonin receptors. Anyhow I've also tried LSD a couple of times and it made me social anxious as fuck, really dind't wanna see anyone when I did that. But I know that that isn't how I am because I used to be so social but how come I'm not anymore? If anyone has tips or questions. Please feel free to ask / tell them!! I use L-theanine now for a while and it makes me alot more relaxed in my head, but they don't bring back the old me. I don't use chemical pills ever again because they're dangerous and addictive. Not only because they're toxic itself but also because they might have fucked up my whole personality. Its insane that when I think of it now they just give speed to 8 year olds because they have a disorder which makes them hyper in their head. Its not right, thats the reason why I only use natural products to relax my brain, L-Theanine, weed and omega-3. I also have used XTC like 3 times and when I do xtc I can talk to people again with no problem and it just goes extremely easy then. But I don't use it more then twice a year. Please if anyone has any tips or comments pleasee ask or tell them! Also if someone knows how to like boosts my serotonin/dopamine receptors I'd love to hear how. I really wanna get back to the person I used to be. And I'm not the only one. Thankyou for reading &lt;3\", 'I know exactly what you\\'re talking about dude. I had this problem all throughout high school. Now it\\'s even worse though because it happens at work, and I work on movie sets, and on movie sets they usually record sound because it\\'s post-1920, which means everyone on set needs to be DEAD silent. Sometimes there are emotional scenes with long, silent pauses in between actors\\' lines. Sometimes there\\'s just quiet while they\\'re waiting for an airplane to go by. And at the end of every day or when they finish shooting in a particular space, they record \"room tone\" which is just 30 seconds of complete, 100% silence. And usually these spaces are very small and filled with lots of people like the director, the script supervisor, the 1st AD, the DP, the 1st AC, the 2nd AC, the boom operator and/or sound mixer, 1+ talent, possibly other department heads like the gaffer, key grip, production designer, or makeup, possibly multiple PAs there to make sure everybody is quiet, etc. and if you make noise you\\'ve fucked up the take. I have such severe anxiety about stomach noises on set that I basically try to avoid actually being on set as much as possible. I\\'m constantly terrified of getting stuck inside when they\\'re about to shoot, because as an electrician I might need to be nearby for small, last second lighting adjustments, or even worse, to do a light gag (lights go on/off or flicker/dim during the shot). I avoid it at all costs and try to stay in an area with no people or somewhere outside where it\\'s loud. It\\'s a daily source of anxiety for me because I never know when I might end up in one of these situations. I\\'ve noticed it seems to happen more when I\\'m anxious, which is almost all the time, and additionally, when I\\'m anxious ABOUT it happening--like it causes itself in a vicious feedback loop. I think for me the physical symptoms of anxiety must somehow cause it, because it\\'s become very evident that I get stomach problems the more worried I am, for example I\\'ll be fine in the morning when I first wake up, but as I\\'m driving to work, I start to feel sick and I do for the first few hours of the day until I calm down. Basically, I\\'m pretty sure the answer is just relax, just chill out mentally, and your body will respond by being at ease. Obviously this is way easier said than done for people with SA. Other than that just drink plenty of water, eat a healthy and balanced breakfast (but not too much), get enough sleep, exercise (this is a huge one), and overall just take that extra step to take care of yourself and your wellbeing. PM me if you want to talk more because I guarantee you I\\'ve thought about this topic and worried over it way more than most people.', \"You never know, maybe she also has her troubles. Nobody is problem-free even if they hide everything perfectly. You can totally ignore her, but you can rediscover a friendship you two used to have. The worst thing that can happen is you ending up not meeting her again in your life, which is pretty much the same thing as choosing not to meet her at all. You can be honest with what you're going through, if she is not an asshole who will judge you. If you honestly 100% feel that she will laugh at you then don't go. But if she is a person you used to be close to, give it a try. I wish my old friends were still with me. edit: I wanted to add that if you have a real big trouble being in public or in a shop or whatever, you can just ask to go on a walk instead of having to speak to other people. People change, for better or for worse, we don't just grow we sometimes get stuck in life and every mature person can understand it.

I can imagine even without being socially awkward it\\'s hard to talk about. All I need to do is tell my parents, but I just can\\'t. I just stall myself by being like, \"it\\'s just in your head don\\'t make a big deal about nothing,\" I know how stupid this sounds but I also feel like I\\'m too young to be depressed. Whenever anyone asks what\\'s wrong the answer is im fine, because I don\\'t know how to explain and really not comfortable trying to. But it\\'s not just this, I\\'ve never been good at trying to tell people how I feel and then break down later. Also my parents don\\'t understand why I say I\\'m fine and get angry with me. They thought I got over my \"shyness,\" years ago although I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m just introverted and socially anxious. Recently it\\'s got worse though and I really don\\'t want to go outside but have to because of school but it\\'s making me really nervous so half the time I leave at lunch because I just can\\'t stand it. I get into trouble for it obviously but anywhere is better than there. I do thankfully have friends and classes can be bearable or with any luck enjoyable if I sit near them, but the teachers don\\'t let friends sit with each other yet force us to sit in groups. I don\\'t know if this is related to my potential anxiety but I sweat a lot at school even the palms of my hands which just adds to my discomfort, it\\'s not even that warm there. Doesn\\'t help that all the teachers hate me. They know I don\\'t know the answer, they know I don\\'t care, they know I wasn\\'t listening, they know I hate speaking out, yet they always ask me.

I\\'m back in college now for the first time in a year and a half after taking time off to treat anxiety, depression, and substance use and absolutely nothing has changed. I\\'m feeling so hopeless. What gives me more anxiety than anything though is talking to girls. I just cant imagine initiating or taking a lead in any situation with a girl. The only real girlfriend I\\'ve had the night we first got together we were sitting alone and I knew she wanted me to kiss her it was painfully obvious but I couldnt even do it. She had to text me after I left saying \"you should\\'ve kissed me.\" I had to leave her to go back to school and I honestly believe unless something changes I\\'ll never be with anyone satisfying again. I\\'ve actually been with a decent number of girls but mostly just off tinder and often much less attractive than me. I have a super high sex drive though and a real burning desire for intimacy of all kinds but I feel completely powerless because I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever be able to approach a girl in any way. So anyway tonight I was watching a soccer game at my school and ended up sitting next to this absolutely beautiful girl. Like stunning. And I didn\\'t even feel like she was out of my league, like I often do, she was just perfectly my type. The whole time I\\'m sitting there I\\'m thinking just say something to her anything anything but of course I couldn\\'t do it. When I walked home I felt like killing myself.

Advice on self-help tips for overcoming this?. Sorry in advance for the long story that i’m about to post but I hope you guys give it a read. I’ve been getting social anxiety especially from eating in public for 2-3 years now and the fact that I can’t even have a peaceful/enjoyable meal out with my friends have been eating me inside out and I want to overcome this so so so badly. The past few years has honestly been the worst few years of my life and I so desperately want things to change. The eating anxiety I have doesn’t really come from being afraid of being looked at in public, its more of being afraid that I would gag/throw up when eating because of the intense nauseous feelings I get whenever I am eating outside in public and it simply just kills my appetite. Its like a vicious cycle. This is how it all started. 3 years ago, I was still all fine with very minimal social anxiety. Since young I have always been a shy and quiet person if you don’t get to know me well but among my friends i’d like to think that I am quite talkative and fun. I hung out with friends very easily in school and used to enjoy going out with them. I even had many friends from the “popular” group in school if that’s what you call them. However sadly this changed for the worse in 2017. I was finishing school and was about to enter mandatory military service. I suddenly got so much anxiety ever since I was about to enter military as there was so much uncertainties that I had about it. I was afraid that I would have a tough time, afraid that I would not be able to adapt to a very different environment, afraid of missing home too much etc. To put it shortly, there were so many things that were not under my control that gave me so much anxiety during this period. I was still at school when all these anxiety came about, and it seemed to just keep getting worse during that time. Sometimes in the morning before going to school i’d feel nauseous for no reason, even brushing my teeth in the morning would cause me to gag. Sometimes (even though rarely) I would even have to go to the toilet just because I felt like throwing up from the nausea I was getting. I started losing appetite very easily and started to rarely have a proper meal during lunch time in school. I started avoiding going out with my friends because of all this feelings I was getting stemming from the anxiety I got. Fast forward to now, I have completed my service and about to start uni early next year. I would say that my anxiety has gotten much better compared to where I was a few years back. However I was never the same in terms of eating in public ever since. I still get all nauseous/choked up/no appetite whenever I am eating outside. When I eat at home its the complete opposite, I can properly enjoy a good meal with no issues at all when i’m home, because I feel “safe”, that even if I throw up/gag nobody can notice or judge. And because of this sense of safety, ironically I don’t have any anxiety at all and don’t feel any nausea, However when i’m out I can only eat in small bites and I find it so difficult to even finish a normal meal. Its taken such a massive toll on my social life. In the past I would hang out with my friends every week, and also go outside to play sports every week. Now these things rarely ever happen anymore, not because I wasn’t invited but because I had to reject my friends every time they asked me out because I didn’t want to end up embarassing myself when we have a meal. Honestly this really hurt me so much because my friends probably now thinks I am deliberately avoiding them or that I don’t wanna hang out with them anymore but the truth is I really don’t have a choice because of all the anxiety I have had experienced. Sometimes I just wished that everyone can understand how I feel or what I am going through. I am starting school again in a few months and I really want to just change myself, and go back to my old self where I had no anxiety when eating in public, where I could really feel joy and happiness when going out with my family and friends, where I don’t have to keep worrying about my eating anxiety, and where I can just feel genuinely happy again. Please advice me on tips I can use as self-help to overcome my social eating anxiety, and thank you for taking the time off your day to read my story. ☺️', 'Yeah my first date with a girl when I was 18 (20 currently) wasnt the best I had tons of social anxiety back then. 80% of success is just showing up. Dont listen to your mind, youre going to be nervous as fuck and its okay to be nervous do not resist it or get angry that you are or youll just make things worse. I hung out with a girl today and I was nervous haha after about 20 min of talking it went away and felt really comfortable with her, I actually started dancing not very srsly but still haha (we\\'re outside and I mentioned I want to get good at dancing and she said show me so I danced like a moron haha) and just started saying everything that came to my mind granted Ive hung out with her once in the past, but still a really attractive girl that makes me a bit nervous. Anyways, being nervous isnt that big of deal, everyone is to a certain degree, take deep breathes before, I dont recommend drinking, if you have a benzo on you maybe take one? Be careful with those and dont mix them with alcohol. Also, give him a hug when you meet him \"Hey hows it going nice to finally meet you\". Best of luck! I understand how you feel try your best its just a random guy on tinder remember that. No pressure logically. Have a fun time and hopefully you and him become friends. If your date has empathy, is a nice guy, mention youre nervous and be confident saying it. When I\\'m nervous with a girl sometimes I mention it and it always goes well as long as I\\'m confident about it. I\\'ve even said to a girl once \"I\\'m a little nervous to be honest, attractive girls make me nervous\" I calibrated it really well, It came off well haha. Crush it I was in your shoes once and millions more too :)', ' I literally always feel like an idiot. Okay so when you go out and see someone that you know unexpectedly do you try to like hide and avoid talking to them or do you just try to talk with them for a brief second so they won\\'t think you\\'re weird or crazy because yes that\\'s what happened to me today I was going for a walk with my nephews and as we were walking we just happened to walk pass their mom\\'s friend sitting in the car on the side of the street waiting on her son coming back from football. So as one of my nephew\\'s were speaking to her I was kinda trying to walk pass so she wouldn\\'t notice me lol, but then she said oh hey \"jasmine\" and I was thinking like dang it but I said oh hey how are you? and she said \" I\\'m doing good\" \"how are you\" and I said that\\'s good I\\'m doing good then she said alright see yall later bye. Okay I know something like this shouldn\\'t be a big deal or something to overthink about, but me being me that\\'s just how I am and yeah it sucks because now I\\'m thinking that she probably was thinking dang this girl is weird like I literally couldn\\'t even get the words out of my mouth trying to speak by the way I do smile a lot when I\\'m speaking to people because it kinda helps me from freaking out you know. ', \" Anytime, darlin'! I'm similar to you in that I don't watch sports, don't really go on dates (rarely asked!), and I don't drink very often. And you are right..being asked why is awkward and kind of annoying! Perhaps we relate though in our reasons. I feel like it's both for me. I often don't know what to do outside and sometimes even if I do know what to do, I have anxiety! Most of it now is that I don't have anyone to do those things with. Venturing out isn't fun for someone like me if I'm alone. My anxiety tends to increase as I probably have a slightly dependent personality. I actually am willing to go out now and even join in with a group of people for a sports game or whatever it might be..but I can't seem to find the group to do it with.......without going by myself first..which I don't want to do.....it's kind of a never ending cycling. I'd have to figure out the point that I can break it and then actually proceed to do so. What about for you? Would you say it's both? \", \"Team sports has been my source of anxiety since I was 6, and led to systematic bullying throughout the final years leading into high-school and that's when I started to feel alienated for good. i have so bad memories that I sometimes consider if it's a genuine trauma.

I do know someone else though who was even more shy than me but he played soccer just fine. When I stepped onto the field the ball made me scared, the first real sign of my crippling anxiety, and I always quit as early as I could and people started yelling at me for being a bad sport.\", \"I honestly have no idea how I made friends. It's actually pretty strange to think about it tbh. It just kinda happens. You don't have to be hanging out with them all the time in fact my best friend of 6-7 years only started hanging out with me outside of school once we graduated. You just got to be friendly and just pick the people you relate with the most. I wasn't the most popular person by any means I'd say I was the average school goer and made like 4 friends i still see and 1 really close friend I hang out with every weekend. Depending how old you're old enough just invite some guys to the club or if you're younger invite them over to play videogames or biking or something.

The guy shares a kitchen in the floor with me, I used to stumble upon him everyday in the kitchen, and now I really don’t want to see him. I don’t want to see any of the other people who were in the trip (but that’s not hard to accomplish as they don’t live in the same building I live in). It’s very humiliating to me when other people intervene to help me with my (lack of) social skills. My parents have done it. My aunts have done it. My professors have done it.

Anyway try to meet friends or something, try to go outside every week, find people to talk too\", 'My struggles with social anxiety. I had pretty severe social anxiety coupled with depression in high school and a fair bit of college. I experienced most/all of the things you mention. I wouldn’t go anywhere for weeks for fear of people seeing me. I was terrified if I went outside to get the mail that a neighbor would see me and judge me. I’d only go grocery shopping at bizarre hours and only use the self check out because of fear of what the cashier would think of me and my purchases. Going to any social event caused panic attacks (sweating, trembling, trouble breathing, chest pain, dizziness). I lived a solitary life and would go months without social interaction. Going so long without having so much as a conversation made me really awkward in any social interaction that I did have. I would be really quiet and keep to myself. Afterwards I’d over-analyze everything that happened, even for days or weeks. So how did I climb out…? Very slowly. I have been on and off antidepressants (SSRIs) since I was 15, never on for longer than 3 months, then I would hop back on when I started to feel really down. I think they helped with the depression, but not so much the social anxiety. I have been on and off therapy as well…and couldn’t really commit to that either. It’s hard to go tell someone your most intimate feelings and thoughts when you’re afraid of how they’re judging you. However, I think it does help some people. I was recommended this [book](It might help. I made one friend towards the end of high school. I had no idea why he wanted to be my friend, but I was so desperate for a friend I just went with it. I found it much easier to just hang with 1 person than a large group that I didn’t know. Then I made one really good friend in my first year of college. She much more actively took action to become my friend, than me becoming hers. We became basically inseparable, and she was my only friend for a while but that was okay because all my social needs were met through her. I transferred schools and she got a boyfriend and our very codependent relationship kinda fell apart. I felt lost for a while, but that is when I realized that I shouldn’t be that dependent on someone else. I made a friend at my new school. I moved on campus and started interacting more with my roommates. I became involved with clubs. I started by just attending talks and meetings, then eventually went onto becoming an officer. A lot of classes were team projects, so I befriended some teammates. I took a teaching assistant position and met people that way. As my circle of friends grew, I met more friends through them. I threw some parties. I went to parties. I learned that sometimes you have to be assertive when making friends. I faked confidence and asked people to hang out, chatted them up online, said hi and talked to them when I saw them. Eventually, it starts to feel less forced and more natural. By the time I graduated I had a great group of friends ranging from very close to not so close. It wasn’t smooth sailing always. I had a really hard time during my internship. I didn’t fit in with the other interns at all. It was like they just looked at me and labeled me as a loser. I felt very socially awkward since most of my friends were also very nerdy/geeky and the interns were a different breed. I did try, but I failed and it was a hard summer for me. I spent most my weekends alone while the others were out doing what interns should do when spending the summer in a beautiful new city. About 6 months ago I moved to a new city, and it’s been tough making friends and adjusting. I feel the insecurities and low self-esteem creeping in on me. I hated constantly meeting new people and small talk. I’m so paranoid that people will see through my confident veneer and find me to be just a giant loser. I miss the easiness with my friends. I tried organizing events with some people at work, but those fell through. Sucks being in a new city with so much to do, but no one to do with it. In the back of my mind, I still fear that if I go do things alone people will see me think of me as a friendless loser. As you can see it’s still a struggle sometimes, but I know I’ve come a long way. I don’t think I’ll ever be the life of the party or 100% not socially awkward. I still have fears and insecurities, but I think the best way to get over them is to just face them. Sometimes you’ll fail real hard, but you’ll learn and get better. I know it’ll be a while before I build a social network like the one I had in college. I’m gonna try taking a fun class after work, meetup.com, and finding a place to volunteer. I’m planning on facing my fear of doing things alone…and I’m gonna go out there and do things alone and hopefully make friends along the way. [part II (Julie)](', \"I'm 24. I enjoy reading, creative writing, biking, shopping, video games, being out in nature, and eating fattening food lol.\", \"21, my only real passions are motorcycles and cars. Whenever it's nice out I really enjoy going out to the mountains and carving my way through them. I also like video games and watching a ridiculous amount of tv and movies. I like spending time with my two little dogs as well (my very good friends sadly lol).\", \"Then when i think about it i feel she is out of my league, maybe a freshman? she did say it was her first semester at the school. I do usually see her on her phone when i do see her in the hall. Maybe she has a boyfriend already? idk, i just wish i knew so i could get these thoughts about this girl out of my head. It sucks, It keeps me from sleep and going about my day normally, It always happens almost every year when there is a girl in one of my classes i like. I get too nervous when i get to that class which i have that specific girl. I then daydream of being together with that particular girl while i'm at a restaurant, going to a park, or even the store. I daydream and wonder how it would be if she was there with me. In HS i was voted shyest male in my class and its funny because i knew the shyest female since the 10th grade up until that point and during senior year i heard even she had a boyfriend (i secretly liked her in 10th grade and of course, same issues applied except i was even worse back then.)\", \"Like the people above me said, online gaming communities are not a good social barometer. These games are full of creeps who don't care how their actions and what they might say might affect other people. And even if the SA wasn't talking for you, these are not the type of people you would to impress or be friends with. And rationally if you can't respect the person, you can't respect their judgment. Like the other day I was walking down the street and some asshole said something mean. And I calmly explained to him how some drunk outside a bar at 2 in the afternoon, who not only has no control of himself but who also can't help but leak his insecurities on to random passers-by, could never ever gain my respect and therefore I could never care about what he has to say. His jaw dropped, he stared at me stupidly and I walked away. Okay enough of a rant Lol. If you want to think rationally and be free from social fear then you have to kick SA in it's lying butt. This is what helped me. Please give it a try. This is a link to the series of tapes that helped me kick SA. It's on Microsoft's Onedrive so you'll need to sign up and make an account.

By the way, the size of your dick doesn't matter as some girls can't comfortably take a lot anyway. Sex is not a requisite for social status. Don't let society fool you. A relationship will not be healthy in the long term if you are emotionally vulnerable. Take the time to grow and take care of yourself first, worry for yourself before other things. Please stop smoking and drinking alcohol. Find an alternative, even vaping or whatever. When you try a certain way and it doesn't work, try another way. Alcohol is a depressant. Smoking shits on your health. Don't consume them. Take up classes. Dance, martial arts, parkour, cooking, anything. Help the community out, volunteer. The Meetup app has clubs you can join to meet people of similar interests. The best way to rid yourself of social anxiety is through exposure. You can learn social skills. You have so much potential, OP. You just have to keep your head up despite the challenges (it will not be easy), and don't let yourself stop you from progressing. Our biggest demons are not the adversities around us, but ourselves. Keep a realistic mindset and you can get to what you want. Be wary of absolute thinking patterns. You can do it. Whenever you get depressive, be your own cheerleader and remind yourself of what you can achieve. You are never weak due to mental illness.

I'm pretty sure they knew. wtf.jpg\", \"I never went to mine, Me  and my family went to the beach that day (though i didnt know until that week we were going) I just didnt tell my parents about prom because i know they would have pressured me into going, maybe with my sisters friend who i didnt even like one bit. I am very shy (i was voted most shy guy in the yearbook) Couldn't really talk to girls, etc. Its funny because i liked the girl they picked for most shy girl for 2 years at that point but of course couldnt act on it. I think she had a boyfriend in senior year though so she was out of the question. It was also expensive  and i think you had to buy 2 tickets. Then about a month later, my parents asked about prom saying when is it  and i said i missed it because we went to the beach that day  and they got pretty mad saying how i should have told them sooner, they only planned that week to go to the beach, and started saying how im missing out  and that I will regret it. Deep down I do regret it, but at the same time i dont because i hate dancing. I think they are just mad cause they dropped out of HS  and had kids at a young age so they didnt get to do these things. My sister did go to hers which was 2 yrs later but of course she is very outgoing  and people cant tell if we are related sometimes. I'm not ugly or anything, just really bad social anxiety  and nerdy that sometimes people thought she was older than me.

I\\'ve been a big victim of the inside-bullying too. Nobody respected me and they obviously talked behind my back because they thought I was annoying or weird or unlikeable and like you\\'ve experienced, they also made these strange proclamations of my name in class too and I think the straw that broke the camels back was when I started to realize that when we had to do the \"find someone to be in group with\" stuff people would walk away as soon as I walked over to them even if I had occasionally talked with them before. It\\'s a testament to how bad my social skills were and how asocial i was outside of classes but what could I do? I couldn\\'t figure it out and people started to think me annoying for it which led to internal bullying. In middle school I had more of it. People would always put me down for whatever I did that wasn\\'t academically succesful which was at least nice so I had something I was okay at, at the time. If I started running people would point and laugh because \"you\\'re a nerd and you can\\'t be sporty\". If I said something I thought was funny then people would default to arrogance and assume what I was about to say would be stupid and then look at each other laughing at what I said as if they were embarrassed I was trying to make eye contact with them because I wasn\\'t worth talking to. I would go as far as to say I have a kind of built up hatred towards people in general over my early schooldays. I know my problems stem from my own lack of putting myself into respect, but sometimes one thing leads to another for no particualr reason and you\\'re put in an unfortunate position for the rest of your time in a group and that can scar you for life if you can\\'t move on from it easily. I don\\'t think often about it admittedly, but if I have to think back in my life all my problems started early on like that. I don\\'t trust people and I assume what I do will be unworthy or stupid or cringeworthy before I even try and i don\\'t take risks because I\\'m afraid people will laugh or ridicule me. It\\'s not irrational. That whole \"anxiety is irrational\" crap is bullshit if you have tried being bullied. It\\'s real and there is a consequence that genuinely hurts if you fail and you\\'ve tried it before, and my worst thoughts tell me that I hate a lot of people for not understanding because they\\'re had it incredibly easy. They\\'ve never fallen out in a group and they\\'ve never done something bad which they couldn\\'t then defend or make up for afterwards. They\\'ve not been stuck in a hole without the skills to crawl up again. They can make it seem like anxiety is strange as much as they like and I\\'ll hate them for it just for their lack of understanding. Anyone who\\'s been a victim of anything will have a newfound dislike for a group untouched by those kinds of circumstances. They don\\'t know anything nor could they care about it unless they try it. That\\'s probably the darkest corners of my mind; the thoughts that say to me that I really want \"good\" people to have it bad. I want people to be bullied like I was. It\\'s like a revenge fantasy that I can\\'t put a lid on. I won\\'t like people who have it good. I just can\\'t help but hate them.

It all depends on what your goal is like to be just Fit lose couple pounds, To Lose a Ton of weight, or to Gain Muscle. Remember those huge bodybuilders had to start somewhere. What body builders usually do or skinny people is bulk up- eat a ton more then they workout out gain more muscle and strength and then cut- do more cardio eat less to get the sixpack/defined muscles. But you can also do cardio to fill out before you start lifting.

That would be my \"Diet\" plan to lose weight fast but if you ever want long term results your going to have change your lifestyle/eating habits and either eliminate, reduce, or replace them.

Every film, book, or video game was a satanic trap that would warp your child's mind and make them obsessed with violence and sex. Pretty much every one of those things is a complete and utter lie. Children are much, much more likely to be abused or kidnapped by adults they know. The entire war on drugs is ridiculous and counter-intuitive. Games and movies haven't lead to an increase in violent behavior. In fact, America, and the rest of the world, has become immensely safer over the last century.

(Long Post) (Need help) This happened yesterday, their was a fest going on in our University and since it was my last fest, i decided to drop Ecstasy. Since our University is located in a rural area their are no proper bars or pubs to drink, so the students have started drinking in a garden which is 50 metres from our University. This was a three day fest and on day two i went out drinking in this garden. I was drinking with my buddies (all guys) and after some time a group of girls from our University came and started drinking besides us. While drinking i noticed that two girls from that group are checking me out. Something about myself:- I am a 21 year old law student in the last year of his course. I have major social anxiety and in my five years at Uni, i have only socialized with a small group of people in my four years in Uni and almost all of them were guys. This was primarily because i got a cultural shock when i moved from a small town to one of the elitist University in India. I am 6ft 2inch with good facial features but a skinny frame. Generally people rate me 7/10. I was decently confident when i started University, but due to my inability to speak fluent English (which is the primary language of conversation in this place) and the highly urban crowd which i had never experienced before, my self confidence was very badly damaged. On top of that i made friends with people who had the same problem of language and culture like me, people who didn\\'t exactly \\'fit\\' in this place. Irrespective, they were pretty toxic and always discouraged and scrutinized any attempts that I made to socialize with people out of our social circle. They would make fun of me for misspranousning words in my presentation and not able to form a coherent sentence when participating in class or speaking to other students. This led to me becoming more and more anxious leading to a total stop by me to try anything or interacting with new people. I just started keeping quiet in lectures and just didn\\'t interact with anyone in the class and made my body language very unnapprochable. This led me getting isolated, loosing my self worth and growing more and more insecure about myself everyday. I started suppressing my opinions and started doing everything which was acceptable by my isolated group of friends. I turned to weed and used to numb myself with it to coupe with the anxiety but the paranoia kept making it worse. I finally started fighting back from my third year and started working on myself. I started getting better at speaking English, learned a lot of new things, got better at studies and putting my opinion forward. I started being more assertive about my boundaries and stopped my friends from walking all over me all the time. But still there is a lot of anxiety, insecurity and an overall inferiority complex. I have only dated one girl in my life which was long distance, we met twice in 3 months and just made out. I don\\'t consider this a proper relationship though. I have a decent amount of good female friends. But it is very difficult for me to talk to a unknown girl, and usually make a fool of myself. I get a decent amount of female attention and a lot of girls have tried to flirt with me but i just get too anxious and awkward. I start overthinking the interaction and always find a way to convince myself that this one isn\\'t right for maybe the next one. However, now i have changed myself and i am trying to actively communicate with girls. I even approached two girls in the gap of six months and got rejected both the times due to very awkward conversation both the times. I have been feeling very lonely for the past 3 years and i crave romantic intimacy. Coming back to story:- After realising that both of them have been glancing towards me, i started making eye contact with the one I was interested in. However, like always i didn\\'t approach her and just left the place after finishing the booze and even give a look back. The next day( last day of the fest) i popped ecstasy and went to the garden with my friends, i started tripping intensely after i reached the party garden. Coincidentally, the same group of girls from day two came and started drinking 20 meters away from us. At this time i had reached my \\'peak\\' of ecstasy and was tripping major nutsack. The high started reducing and got a collected my self a little bit but i was still pretty high, now i start noticing that the same girl from yesterday was again galncing at me in very short intervals, i started making eye contact with her but would break it in 2-3 seconds because of second thoughts. My friends started leaving for college but i was still pretty high so i decided to stay on my own, i started socialzing with people that i knew and all this while me and that girl kept making eye contact. I still wasn\\'t sure weather i should go and talk to her. Then she looked at me for like 10 seconds without breaking eye contact and gave a huge smile. Because of the lowself esteem idiot that i am, i looked turned my neck in both the directions to confirm that she was actually smiling at me. Any other day I would have bounced from that place without approaching her because of my fear of rejection and making a fool out myself but not this time. This time i was on Ecstasy and wasn\\'t feeling my high level of anxiety which generally happens in these kind of situation. I decided I am going to make to make a move this time. I had promised myself in the summer that I\\'ll try and break my virginity in my last year of law school. I waited for an appropriate moment in which she wasn\\'t occupied too much by her friends. I saw an opening and started walking towards her, she was making her drink from the bottle which was on the ground. I stopped 3 ft away from she turned saw me and smiled like she was expecting me. She turned her head again and i just froze. I couldn\\'t utter a word, and after standing there for like 5 seconds without saying anything. I just walked of from their. I cursed by my self for being so pathetic and thought about going back in the college. But i decided to calm myself and try once again because i was really interested in this girl. I smoke a cigarette, muster all the courage and started walking towards her again, this time she was standing with her friend who were both dancing on rap. I stopped she saw me then started looking at her friend. I am feeling extremely nervous right now but i fight it and after 3 seconds i say \" I am sorry for earlier, i just got nervous\" in a very shaky voice. She responded \"it\\'s okay you don\\'t have to worry about that\" in a very soft tone. I ask her name tell her mine then shook her hand. Another friend of her came thinking that i was making her friend uncomfortable. Her friend who came, starts looking at me in a very suspicious way because it could be interpreted by my face that i was on some hard Drugs ( which i think the girl who i approached also figured out) my anxiety shoot up the roof and i wasn\\'t able to utter even an alphabet. I froze again and walked of again, this time for real. I had a very bad trip after this incident and kept cursing myself for being a losser. I seriously need help as to how to overcome my social anxiety and be self- confident, that why i gave a detailed description of myself.

Anyways my dog ran across the street and nearly got hit by a car whilst the delivery guy just stood there awkwardly and the lady in the car started yelling at me then drove away. I ran over to get my dog but he kept running further and further away everytime I got near him. I chased him for 5 minutes around people's gardens and driveways until I finally caught him and looked up to see about 4 people plus the delivery guy looking at me and laughing. The delivery guy gave me the parcel and I went inside with my dog. When I got inside i couldn't breath and I felt like I was dying. I don't know if it was a panic attack or not because I've never had one but I think it was caused by a mix of not going outside for about a week then suddenly going and doing that and the pain in my feet because I was just wearing socks when I was chasing him and I walked over sharp stones so they were bleeding.

Sometimes people asked me something or included me in a conversation, but I'd say something for ten seconds and then it'd be back to just listening. I feel so embarrassed now. My best friend asked me multiple times whether everything was ok (not literally asked, more like thumbs up or down, because she knows I have bad social anxiety) and afterwards she went outside with me and told me she was really glad I came to her party even though I shouldn't have had to come, because she knew how hard this was for me. She told me she was really proud of me and that she was impressed I managed to stay for so long (which I did because it was too loud and I didn't know how I had to say that I wanted to leave so when everything fell silent I took my chance and said I was tired and was gonna leave), but that we could have also just gone out the two of us for her birthday. I definitely don't think she's mad or anything at me, but I'm really scared now that 1. She thinks I had a horrible time, which I didn't.

I made sure I had a few places of interest to go to in each city I visited, I think that's pretty important when traveling alone. Depends on your personality of course, but for me going in without any kind of plan and just expecting to have a good time like that would have been a doomed attempt. Many times I wished I had a friend to go with, but at the same time I was happy to be able to go at my own pace and only to places I enjoyed, and to eat food I actually liked (as opposed to having to adapt to the tastes of other people when choosing restaurants and cafes) At one point I ended up having to spend the night in central Tokyo and unlike in my home country, the main train station was not open all night, so I had to spend some hours outside by myself which was a bit unnerving but it ended up being just fine luckily.

But that loneliness forced me to finally admit it to myself and started the progress that finally made me get help with my depression and anxiety. I try to see this positive side to it. And I'd chosen a country the culture of which I was interested in so I suppose I had that going for me. At the time it was socially terrible though, literally everyone else was making all these friends and I had none. I was always alone. Even had to admit that out loud a ton of times when in the oral exams for the local language the teacher made me say things like 'My best friend here is X' etc and I told her I had none but since I had to say someone's name for the sake of the exam, I went with the person who'd done the exam right before me. It was a private exam so it's not like that person ever heard me say it.

Going on hikes and visit famous attractions. Might be a let down when you actually see those places but at least now you know what people were raving about. 3. Just walk around randomly for a day off the beaten path and take breaks at coffee shops. At night go to bars and clubs and talk to strangers.

Once every couple days, I make the effort to go outside and go on a two and a half hour bike ride just for the sake of getting some exercise, but other than that I don't often leave the house. Other than exercise, there is absolutely nothing to justify the expenditure of going outside. There is no money to spend, there are no friends to talk or catch up with, and there are no places which I want to visit.

When the homework was a pubic presentation or recitation of a verse by heart, I never completed these homewroks, as a result of which I got F grade and I had to hope only that in future we would no longer have such tasks, I was also afraid to go to the teacher and give me an individual task. In high school, the situation did not change, I was still afraid of public speaking and did not leave home unnecessarily, and when friends called for a walk, I always said that I was busy. A quick fact, in all my life I have never been to a cafe, to the cinema i wasnt even in a store alone. If I needed something, I asked my parents or sister to buy me. In 2016, I passed the exams and entered the pedagogical university at the Faculty of Philology, this was one of the biggest mistakes in my life. Due to the fact that I did not really care about where to go, I had to quickly choose the direction. I had to move from countryside to city (not to far tho, about 130 kms) and learn to live on my own, buy groceries, pay utility bills and most importantly communicate with people, from that moment I no longer saw my friends live, both moved to other cities. Speaking of classes at the university, each English class needed to stand in front of the audience and tell the learned text, there were also quite often group work, and if I could barely cope with the first example, then when we worked in groups I was ready to disappear, run away , do anything if only I were not here, cause i simply cant talk to people which i dont know, My palms and forehead began to sweat. No kidding, when I reached the bus stop and went to the university, for me it was a real challenge. What makes me even more anxious is that there were 22 girls and 6 boys in the group keying me. I went through anxiety for two months until one day I decided not to go to university, and from that moment on, my life went awry. I began to skip classes more and more, sleep problems started, I went to bed at 8 in the morning, and got up at 7 in the evening and my parents didnt even know about this situation. With bad points, but I still went through the first semester. But in the second situation did not change, I was not at the university for exactly a month and none of my classmates, headmen or curator were interested in what happened to me. By the way, in January 2017, I stopped talking with one of my friends, the communication just broke due to some little trifle I don’t even want to mention it. April 2017, the curator told his parents that I did not attend classes, but I in turn made promises that I would attend classes. One day, after a long absence in class, the curator called me to his place and began to ask me what was happening to me, I had good points for the first months of my studies, and then everything went awry. After the conversation, she advised me to turn to a psychologist, but I immediately rejected this idea, although now, I understand that it might be worth giving this idea a chance. Even the girls from the group offered me their help, but I refused, i decided that it will be extremley hard to comeback.I just don’t have the courage to approach the teacher and ask for additional classes. As a result i was expelled from university. While I was in the city alone, I talked a lot about what to do next. They set me up as an example for my sister, laid more hopes on me, but I just didn’t live up to these hopes, I myself was not in awe of myself, I considered myself miserable and that there was no place for me like this in this world, so I decided that the best option there will be suicide. I decided to hang myself in the closet and when I felt cramps and lack of oxygen, a stupid thought crept into my head and said to me “Do not do this, give yourself a chance”. Now, I really regret that I succumbed to that thought and did not finish what it would be worth In September 2017, I entered college and again, in November 2017, I was expelled. Classical history, anxiety, unwillingness to leave the dorm room due to loneliness, although I understand that I had to go to college and university not for communication, but for education. For almost 2 years now I have been living with my parents in the village, I leave the house only to throw snow from the yard, I haven’t been talking with my last friend since January 2019. My younger sister graduated from college, works and receives money, while I just sit on the neck of the parents. Guess, i messed up my life, opportunities, goal and there is nothing i can do about it. I dont watch movies, series, anime, sometimes playing games but right now nothing interests me, i just lay down on the bed and thinking about my pasy and what i have done.

I think it has something to do with people can sense if your uncomfortable or have anxiety. Which then makes them uncomfortable which then they flee. I remember I used to be popular back then and I could talk to almost anyone anxiety free. Now that I look back i think I did have underlying effects of SA. I could talk normally, I had friends, I could do presentations, talk on the phone, I did extra activities, talk to teachers, have fun, ect. But now looking back i do remember sometimes where that wasn’t the case. Sometimes I would hide in the bathroom to change clothes. I wouldn’t talk to other kids until a friend walked in to summer camp/class. I would get really uncomfortable if I was in a certain groups or usually when I sat next to certain women (I would try to act cool or some shit). I think I just somehow broke later on in life and my anxiety shut me down. Now back to my point.

First date we just went to the movies and later ate at a restaurant and walked around after that day she ghosted me for 2 weeks and then started talking to me again and said sorry and wanted to try again. Second date I went hiking with her and watched the sunset and ate at a pizza place after that day she avoided me for a few days with a bunch excuses then asked me out again and I was like sure. Third date we went to a restaurant then walked by the beach and saw the sunset she kissed me that night and told me why she avoided me all those days apperntly she was scared we would destroy our friendship and she already lost her bofriend and didnt wanna lose me too well I accepted her but few days later I went out with a cousin to watch some movies and a saw her walking with her neighboor (she told she was studying at home ) and then they started kissing they looked so inloved. It kinda hurt becuase she was my befriend and lied to me. But I grabbed my phone took a picture of them send it to her and told her with a message \"I just saw you And I dont think we can be friends anymore\" and I ghosted her after that I cut all contact with friends of hers and family (first time I ghosted someone). I like to tell myself its no big deal but it really hurts when someone you trust betrays you like that. This event isnt really the reason for my anxiety but it sure made a bit worse I think.

Back at my old school we had an aftercare after school and since my mom worked late everyday, after school I would be there 24/7. This started from Kindergarten-8th grade. Which probably explains why I was decent at most sports. I agree with you on that one. Volleyball is an anxiety inducing sport.

It’s real bad especially if the other team targets you because your the weak one in the team. Some other examples of anxiety in sports that I’ve felt looking back. When your playing football and you run out, you see the quarterback and he looks at you and then ignores you and continues with the play. Or he finally decides to throw it to you and sadly the catch is not received. Especially embarrassing if your wide-open :/ Same with baseball, someone would hit a pop fly out to me and I would usually miss and have to throw it in. The shame, the shameeee. The rest I would just try to make jokes on them I would feel the anxiety but I wasn’t scared of doing the sports. I was scared of failure and of losing. I was real competitive back then. It was like a different anxiety back then. When I got into hs though I didn’t make any sports teams lol and my anxiety was through the roof. Lol that’s pretty funny looking back at it.

He was a regular at the gym I went to and kindly helped me with getting used to working out and how to do everything correctly. We got on well since we both had similar interests and he had dealt with mental health issues as well so he seemed to be very patient and understanding with me.

I don\\'t think she\\'s with him anymore, but I still haven\\'t seen her since high school - I don\\'t know if I\\'ll ever see her again. So rage against your subconscious thoughts telling you to be quiet because it\\'s worth taking that chance of rejection. If I saw her again, I\\'d tell her how I felt about her back then.', 'Once when I was out for a walk with my headphones,a kid asked me what time it is. I had my headphones on so I didn’t hear if he said auntie or didi(a term for girls older than you). I told him the time and walked away. But I was literally crying inside whether he called me auntie or didi because it made me self anxious and till this day I am thinking of what he called me. By the way I am 16', ' I was in cross country in highschool and our coach would take us to a local park for our runs. There he taught us that it is very common to say \"Good Morning, afternoon, evening\" when you pass by people. He said to just -WAVE- to passer Byers when we were on our faster run where we had to focus more on hitting a time so we can still be respectful. A rule for eye contact and also greeting strangers is when being approached or approaching a stranger you make eye contact and if they don\\'t immediately look away then say hello or hey (whatever feels natural to you) ', ' That’s exactly what we’re doing, eating some icecream while taking a walk.

I moved to U.S a 5 years ago. I met him in high school. I have been knowing him for 5 years. He often hanging out with me when he wanna do something for fun or when he doesn't have someone to hag out with. He doesn't open up about his life or give me advice when i asked about something. I know it, he wasn't real friend but The problem I couldn't afford losing him because he was my only Friend, and when i feel wanna do something he often free + other people who i know have different work schedule so when i have day off they work and also I'm 25 it hard to make friend in this age. I live in north part of the U.S in small state. From what I see People tend to stick with people they know. It summer time and I have plans to hike and do other fun stuff but i cant do them myself . I hiked last week by myself and I didn't like it. It felt weird, I just wanna share my memories with someone when i do something. i quit smoking because I was often smoke with him. After he left i don't feel the joy of smoking myself lol. I tried to do things to fill feel the need for friend but i cant. Still feel lonely. What i should i do guys?\", ' Anyone else feel emotionless in public?. Because of anxiety I feel like I’m not “allowed” to have emotions like other people. I know it doesn’t make sense. But like I’m not worthy almost, or I’ll look so stupid and disgusting if I do show emotion. I could never cry at a funeral, even a family member, never cry in public over anything, if something said something insulting I wouldn’t show any emotion, if something traumatic or an accident happened straight in front of me I would help out but wouldn’t show any negative emotion at all. Once as a kid I was leading group of younger kids on horses with some other adults and teens. The horse stepped on my foot and broke two toes. It hurt but I didn’t even flinch and just kept walking because I didn’t want to look stupid. No one noticed a thing. Just an example but there have been similar throughout my life.

So i was visiting my Grandpa with my dad, and since my social anxiety gets really bad around men, (even though im litterly a man myself) I barely talked when my granpa said stuff to me, and when i did talk, i litterly had a cringe/anxiety attack because he asked me, do you like this? and i accidently shook my head no, and then i actually had the courage to say \"I meant to say yes\" but when i did, it came out sounding like a screeching swing, and my grandpa, didnt even hear it. My heart dropped and i litterly had to go outside to cool down. When i went outside, (my granpa has 7 acres of land) I just stood like a pshycopath, with my eyes wide open, and my mouth open, drooling. staring in a daze at the dark field (this was at night time) I just stood for 10 minutes starring at the dark. I hate this life. I hate having a cringe attack and litterly having to go outside to cool off, everytime i speak. My only hope is alcohol, or medicine. Im gonna choose alcohol, since i was previously on the medicine and it gave me horrible side effects. Over all, this social anxiety is not something you can just work to get over. Im going to need substances to rely on for the rest of my life, especially if im gonna join the u.s navy, and go to college.', \"What can I do about this??. So I am a 19 y/o girl and going to be a sophomore in college. I am diagnosed with social anxiety and my BIGGEST fear is presentations. Everything that could go wrong goes wrong... It's not cute. So throughout freshman year, I had a number of presentations assigned to almost every class. This is embarrassing to admit, but I failed 4 of my classes, because I never showed up for my presentations, which resulted in failing 4 classes. I am not a bad student, like I WANT and WISH I could succeed and complete my presentations, but my social anxiety is so bad to the point where I literally would rather take the F's than to present in front of my classes. But college is too much money to be doing that obviously. And I know that there will obviously be more presentations in the future, so how can I get through this and not fail my classes. I can't just avoid them, but is there something I could tell my teacher or someone? I just don't want to be the only one not presenting, and then people wonder why I got out of it you know? Like I want it to be fair for everyone, but I just get so embarrassed and overthink EVERY little thing.  and#x200B; Anyway, I've just been a lil stressed about this. And now I'm on academic probation, so I can't play soccer this year. :( I've been thinking about doing online college, but then I worry too much about leaving friends, not having anyone to socialize with, and a whole lot of other worries. I just don't know what to do with myself ya know. Ugh, it's exhausting. Sometimes I just wish life was easier.\", ' had a panic attack at new years party. So for the first time in years I went to a new years eve party, it was my boyfriends coworkers party and i was invited to go. I brought alcohol with me in hopes that it would make me more relaxed and confident to talk to people, and for a while I was fine. After midnight I was starting to get very drunk and sleepy, the other people who were there were all chatting and having a good time. I continued to drink and didn\\'t realize how much I\\'ve had until I was barely able to walk. I stuck by my boyfriends side and he kept conversing with other people while I was starting to fade in and out of consciousness. I eventually found myself on the couch by myself and someone was telling me to play a game with them, I started to panic and didn\\'t know what to do. My boyfriend went to the table where they were going to start playing the game and looked over at me and asked if I was going to play, and I just agreed because I didn\\'t want to be left out. The first game was fine, it was a pictionary type game, then the next game dealt with reading out cards and doing whatever was on the card. I was starting to feel my pulse rising and I couldn\\'t think or control my body. Every now and then they\\'d make jokes and I\\'d quietly laugh, and one of the girls looked at me and said \"you know you can just laugh! you don\\'t have to hide it or cover your mouth\" and at that moment I became hyperaware of all of my actions...I didn\\'t realize I was trying to hide my laughter, and her pointing that out just sent me into a major state of panic...I just kinda stopped myself from reacting to anything because I didn\\'t know what to do. Eventually it got to my turn in the game and I asked if I could just pass it to the next person, because I was feeling extremely anxious at this point, but they insisted I just read the card. I tried reading the card but they couldn\\'t really understand me so my boyfriend had to take the card and read it. I felt embarrassed and just sat there feeling really anxious. I felt so out of place in that moment and I just wanted to escape. I snuck away from the table and sat on the couch by myself and started hyperventilating. I texted my boyfriend if I could leave because I\\'m having a panic attack, a few minutes pass and he tells me to \\'go outside\\', but I didn\\'t want them to see me walk outside or question me...so i just sat there and started crying. A few more minutes pass and my boyfriend came over to me and asked me if i wanted to go outside with him, and we did. I was judging myself so hard and i felt so upset at myself for taking my boyfriend away from the party, but he tried his best to take care of me. We stayed the night at the friends house and I was up most of the night feeling really sick. It\\'s the next day and I apologized to my boyfriends coworker, telling her i had a bit of a panic attack, she was understanding. I just keep thinking about everything that happened and how my brain blew everything way out of proportion to the point i couldn\\'t control my actions or thoughts. I feel so bad that my boyfriend is so social and likes to be around friends but I\\'m the super quiet girlfriend that\\'s afraid of socializing... he keeps telling me it\\'s fine and everything is good and that he loves me and wants to protect me and it makes me happy...but i just feel bad for having such a bad reaction...I just drank way too much , thinking i\\'d be a social butterfly but it did quite the opposite. Ugh. ', \" I've developed social anxiety since moving to a foreign country.. Back in my home country, I did not have this debilitating sense of dread whenever I needed to go outside. I have lived in Asia and went to an international school since the second grade. I had a lot of confidence in myself, as well as a decent group of friends. I still wasn't the most social guy, but I had friends I could relate to. I was able to go to malls, shopping centres, cafes and what not, and converse with the cashier/waitress as a normal person would, although I was a bit awkward. Since then, I've moved to the UK for my undergrad, and man I've basically become a shut-in here. I am too shy to make friends with the local students, I feel like my english despite being good enough is different from the way its spoken in Britain, hence whenever I try to start a conversation, my sentences tend to be incomplete and simply words strung together without a proper structure. My self-esteem has suffered deeply because of this. It's been a year and a half now, and its not getting any better. I'm feeling a mixture of denial and knowing that I shouldn't feel this way because I could function normally back home, as well as anger at myself because I just can't help myself to get out of this condition. I refuse to acknowledge that I have a problem, and I keep looking for reasons as to why I might be the way I am now. Here's how my daily life feels like to me: I leave my apartment complex and walk to university. On my way, I feel that everybody is looking at me, judging me for being so awkward and lame. Once I get to the lecture rooms, people are conversing outside, talking to each other while waiting for class to start. I see people I've talked to before, but for some fucking reason I decide not to make eye contact and sit/lounge around alone. I take out my phone, hoping that nobody notices that I am a loner. I walk into the class, and am greeted by the sight and sound of hundreds of students in this massive lecture hall. I try not to make a fuss about it but I am actually panicking about where I would be able to sit down, without attracting attention to myself. I finally find a place and a couple of people in a group decide to sit next to the empty spots next to mine. They're talking, having a lot of fun, asking each other about how last night's party was and what not. And I'm just there, probably they're oblivious to me even being there. Once lecture finishes, and classes are done for the day, I immediately walk back to my room. This walk back is often filled with bitterness and intense feeling of loneliness, as I pass by other students walking with their friends. The worst part of all this is that I can't figure out why I am the way I am now. Why could I function normally, and live without fear back home but once here I'm afraid of the outside world. I'm afraid of the eyes that aren't probably even looking in my direction, of the laughter I hear around me, thinking that it must be at my expense, while simultaneously knowing that it isn't. I am stuck and I don't know why. \", \"New around here, but not to anxiety.. Hello there! I am new to reddit, I felt it was a good move to make so I could learn about and finally feel calm, knowing that I am talking to people who take this sort of thing seriously. I'll give some background... I am a 16 year old male. I have suffered from social anxiety/phobia for the past 3 or 4 years. I have no idea what went wrong or where. I used to be able to go the shop on my own, but now... I don't even go there. I am too scared. Even in broad daylight... I am petrified of going. I don't know who I'll bump into or whatever. I think my anxiety is because I am fearful of what people are capable of. I am a very weary person, and I trust no-one to begin with. I really dislike it when someone says it's just because I'm shy. NO. It's not. You don't quite know how I feel. This is more than being shy. It's fear. I have never been one to make a fuss of anything. I have never been the 'class clown', I have only been in one detention (that was for forgetting a ruler in maths, lol) and I haven't been to the headmasters office. I feel a bit like Elliot from Mr. Robot if anyone knows what that is. I DESPISE going outside in urban areas. I cannot stand densely populated area. My parents often ask me if I want to go on a walk with them and the dog. All too often, I say no. It's not because I'm lazy; rather fearful of who's outside and who might see me. I almost hate everyone at school. Except from a few people. People I associate with. People I know and can trust. Trust has also been a big issue with me. At this moment in time, the only people I trust enough are 2 of my friends and my family. My mum is very supportive. (Not saying my dad isn't, it's just that my mum is the first port of call for me) Like I say, I never leave the house unless it's completely necessary. Maybe I hate society. I stay inside other than when I have to go to school. I hate parties. I hate crowded areas. I cannot speak on the spot if someone questions me about something. I just freeze and stutter... just pushing any old bull**** out of my trap. On a weekend, I spend probably 1/2 of my day in my room. Doing stuff on my computer or just playing games. Enough rambling on. I'll just break down my diagnosis into bullet points for the most relevant things... I cannot make eye contact I hate going outside. I dislike most people at my school I sit at my computer neigh on all day doing stuff I shouldn't be doing I cannot speak in front of people I do not know This one I HATE. If I saw someone getting bullied, hurt or anything, I would probably do nothing because I would be too scared to do anything about it. I CANNOT HELP THIS!! I am a very, very, very, very, very, very, private person. Words can't express how private I am. No-one knows much about me. (Except for family, obviously). No-one externally if you will. I am trying to get a visit into my GP. Even for this I'm too scared! :(\", \" Swimming. I've gotten it into my head that I want to go swimming for a couple of weeks but.. you know.. people. I don't want to be forced to swim in the same lane as other people and to swim past them (in opposite direction so awkward eye contact ot award looking away). I even asked the place when they have the least amount of people there. They said around lunch. Last night I had managed to convince myself to go but I couldn't fall asleep and my throat is itchy. I still have a sore or itchy throat but it's not that bad and I'm trying to decide if I should go swim tomorrow or not (if I can fall asleep) Anyone regularly swim? How do you do it? Certain times and days when there's less people? Don't care if theres a lot of people? \", '14 years old... Daily Social Anxiety. Hello. My name is Jacob and I hope I am posting this in the right spot. I\\'m 14 and I believe is have had social anxiety for pretty much my entire existence so far. Let\\'s take it back to preschool. I remember looking at myself and always thinking \"I\\'m fat\". I know I was young, but I was extremely skinny, but all I saw was fat when I looked down, and actually tried to keep it a \"secret\" from school and my family.i guess the next instance started around 3rd grade. That was the summer after my great grandma died. She used to live next door, and every day I thought about seeing her. She was an amazing woman that I miss so much. After she passed, I felt at loss for quite a while. The year after, bullying started kicking in. I actually became overweight, really saw no difference than before. I was teased for being fat, or stupid, or told I \"liked boys\". I pretty much felt no need for social interactions any time after that. I know I was young, but of course that shit still happens today to me. As of my current situation, doing almost anything social wise is difficult. The best way I can describe it is like a huge amount of embarrassment before the actual event. But it\\'s really worse than I am describing it. It feels like any action I take in some sort of social area (school, restaurant, store, park, ect.) someone there is either watching me do it and thinking badly of me, which I hate, or I am constantly going over in my had be bad things people will say to me. Confrontations are another big issue for me. If I want something, I would rather miss out than ask for it. It makes me feel like I am burdening someone else\\'s life for my own needs, and that they might think badly of me. This ranges anywhere from asking my brother to help me with homework to even just asking someone to point me in the direction of the soup isle in a store. It is also very difficult for me to do anything social wise that could result in me screwing up, even tho 90% of the things that get to me have a 0% screw up rate. This anxiety has gotten to the point where I cannot even enter a grocery store alone out of fear that someone is watching me (although when I am forced to, i always use self checkout) so that is most of my anxiety. I really haven\\'t told anyone how I feel about this before tonight, so I Hope you enjoyed reading about my problems... Have a nice night or day everyone', \"Crippling fear of exercise may actually cause me to get type 2 diabetes. Hi, first post on this sub. I'm Butter, how are you. Alright anyway, my family is at an extremely high risk for type 2 diabetes. Runs in the family or whatever. I'm pre-diabetic at age 18. Gym teachers made fun of me when I ran in elementary school. I was always the last kid in the grade to finish. The humiliation I felt when everyone was watching me panting and wheezing, cheering me on to finish the last lap of the yearly mile at age 10 really screwed me up. They had no ill intentions, I was just so embarrassed. I don't run. I can't do it and I hate every minute of it. I don't exaggerate at all when I say that I would rather be marked as skipping every single day of the week and serve out all detentions than run the mile at school. I don't run. A few years back I got the majority of my spine fused. I have no flexibility from the end of my neck to just above my lumbar. I don't know how I look when I try to exercise or dance, I just feel *weird*. Like I can't move without looking jerky and awkward. Because of this, my belief that everyone is staring at me all the time no matter where I am, and my fear of running, I don't exercise in public at all. I would exercise at home, but I know my parents will make fun of me. The have no ill intentions but they aren't able to hold a conversation about anything without making fun of it. Trying to have them stop will result with them getting defensive and argumentative, so I'm not doing that. If I ever exercise, I do it when nobody is home, in the basement with the doors locked. Times like that are rare, so sticking to a schedule is hard. How do I exercise without having what little mental comfort I have left falling to shambles?\", \"how to walk?. this is seriously my worst symptom when it comes to social anxiety. As soon as I get around a crowd of people, or even go into a store, I start walking idiotically. At first I thought it was just me who thought about it, but I've had a few friends call me out, as well as one time having a guy mimick me walking as we were walking past him. My one friend described it as me walking like I'm trying to hide something, with my arms hugging to my sides and not really swinging them. its horrible that at 22 I still can't walk like a normal person. I often think it may have to do with how skinny I am. I think I feel like people are judging me and I go into self defense mode.\", \"I need some advice. I am a 20 year old female who has been struggling with depression, social anxiety, generalizedanxiety and OCD for 3 years now. It was triggered due to a couple major close deaths one right after the other; I don't know how to handle grief. ..and a continuous sexuality assault situation that really left me in a self loathing, self conscious mess. It would take me to go into complete detail but I'm going to explain some things quickly to get to my point. It has gotten to a point where I can not hold face to face conversations. I am afraid to even leave my bedroom in my own home that is shared by just me and my very supportive boyfriend. I am afraid to go outside or even apply for jobs because I know I won't get through the interview and if I do even make it that far I leave the job or get fired because I just stop showing up. I'm at a complete loss. I feel like I have absolutely no control over anything. I feel like an empty shell and that scares me. I do convince myself to leave the house but only if my boyfriend is with me. He has become a crutch that I just don't want to drop. I'm afraid he will leave because it seems like I can't be independent of do anything on my own.\", 'Struggling to get myself outside again. To start things off: i\\'m 21 years old, i\\'ve been a shut-in since i ended highschool (4 years now...) and i\\'m struggling, really hard, to start something up again. Mostly out of anxiety and fear. God .. okay. So i became a shut-in after some personal issues, including trying to figure out what the hell was going on with my life... having a huge fear of failing things and getting nervous about anything social. I remember my mother telling me that it\\'s just shyness in general but i knew that it was way different, it wasn\\'t shyness, it was actual fear. I\\'m always been a little bit afraid of everything that i\\'m doing. An obvious thing is the pressure of being interesting and not a bore around others. Another one is cooking for others: it feels like they expect me to do at least a good job, but if i mess up i get a hard anxiety attack and start crying. And if i\\'m tasked to do something for someone, like a job task, which i\\'m paid for, i think about it in circles before i even do it, and i imagine what things could go wrong, and how i should do it perfectly, or else i picture people around me laughing or making fun out of me. I was kind of teased that way while growing up... Anyways, things like going outside, making phone calls, interacting with strangers all day makes me feel terrified and sick to my stomach. Work makes me anxious. I\\'m absolutely afraid of starting to work, even though i know i should. I feel like a leech to my parents. I just can\\'t bring myself to start working, because it seems to be this huge terrifying place where people are yelling at me what to do, and if i mess up i\\'m going to be punished, in the social sense. I have this screwed up idea of how the world works, even though i haven\\'t been outside... at all. It\\'s like something i rely on and believe is true even if i agree that the world doesn\\'t work that way. It\\'s hard unsticking myself from it... This is rambly. Anyways, the stupid thing is, if i force myself to go outside, and for example, take a walk... then after i\\'m done with it it doesn\\'t feel that bad. I feel, okay, i can handle this, this wasn\\'t as bad as i thought. So clearly i just have to force myself out to experience it even if it wrecks me. It\\'s still really difficult. While inside, shielded from the outside world, a (figurative) voice in the back of my head tells me that the outside world is still scary, and the times i\\'ve been taking a walk doesn\\'t matter. I feel like i\\'m completely submitting myself to the inner fear, \\'ego\\', whatever whenever this happens. It tells me that i should feel scared, and worry about things, and think \"what if\"... it fools me in to thinking that it\\'s for my own best. I can recognize this yet i feel powerless to change it. Until i actually take the first step, which feels like the hardest thing in the universe, and it dissolves right in front of me. I recently did an experiment with my boyfriend, where, when he would be brutally honest and criticize my bad habits (which i\\'m thankful for) i would stop fighting and just \"give up\", something i fear a whole lot. Whenever someone would criticize me, i would feel a need to fight back, in order to prove myself, to not be seen as weak, or whatever. I gave up and admitted that i was wrong, and it gave me such a relaxed feeling that i have never felt before. It felt like i could finally relax my muscles, and stop worrying about what he, or other people thought about me, and as a consequence i didn\\'t feel any social anxiety, or any anxiety for that matter. I think this \\'ego\\' is the root of the problem, making me worry about behaving in a \"good\" way, so that people will like me. This makes sense as when i was a child/teen, people used to avoid me for some reason. So at least i have something to work with. I hate worrying about things way too much, i hate thinking about things in circles before even doing something, i hate thinking i know how it\\'s gonna play out even if it never does. I never am right in my predictions and yet i think it\\'s the safest way to go. It\\'s stupid. I wish i could do something as simple as getting a job, and handle my own life, but i can\\'t. It seems too daunting and i worry way too much about messing up and looking stupid. My english is dumb i\\'m sorry', \"Comforting Myself in Times of Extreme Depression. Things are really bad for me right now. Yesterday I came to the realization that I think I'm actually at peace with the thought of suicide. Made a previous post about it. People always say try to find a hobby, which I already have I listen to music 24/7  and wanted to be a singer my whole life. But obviously I'm still suicidal with that. It's gotten so bad for me that I surround myself with little things that are comforting to me even in the slightest. A few good examples: The smell/ taste of carmex, myrrh incense, roasting pecans, the smell/ taste of tobacco. Little things like this, I was really sad earlier so I was smearing carmex all over my hands  and mouth like a psychopath freak.  and I don't smoke anymore because its an expensive thing  and I'm broke but even when I was little before I ever once smoked there was this one restaurant I loved because half of the place was a smoking section. My favorite place to go when I was little,  and afterwards my clothes would smell like smoke  and I loved it. I feel like I would love to go running but my social anxiety is the worst with that kind of thing. I had like 8 cups of tea earlier because that's really comforting to me... I am so weird. But I am in a very dark place right now I'm doing everything I can. EDIT: Oops I'm an idiot. The reason for a lot of this is because I'm trying to email follow up on a few job applications. I am so bad at thinking what to say  and I'm convinced I won't hear back anyway.\", 'Anxiety with people of my age.. Whenever I\\'m walking outside (mostly with my dog), I can see people of my same age or most likely adolescents (I\\'m 15). Even if they are completely into their business I feel like they might look at me, and say something into their heads, or worse... To their friends next to them. You know, I\\'m skinny and feel horrible, and they are most of the times better looking than me, and it makes me feel reaaaally bad. I try to avoid eye contact and I can\\'t tolerate less than 100 meters between us. I don\\'t know why I\\'m less anxious when facing adults, little kids or elders, but I think it\\'s because I compare me to them, and see many differences. It wasn\\'t always like this... It began to be a real thing a bit after the start of high school. When I was in the class, there were these two guys that looked at me like they were facing a monster. I even realized after a moment, that when one of them came at me and tried to be \"FRIENDLY\" (or an asshole) he grabbed my arm trying to be stealthy (obviously I noticed it immediately), and after finishing he went away. That, just to feel the girth of my arm. That built my social anxiety. Before it, I could wear anything without being bothered by how I might have looked and how much of me was shown to others. For this, I love cold seasons, so I can cover my body as much as I like without looking weird and generate comments like: \"Oh my god, aren\\'t you melting?!\". In fact, I\\'m extremely anxious just thinking about going back to school... I really hope someone will come talk to me, and if they do, I hope they don\\'t limit it to just a \"Hi\".

I would just like to hear people's opinion on this topic. I'm 21 and I've been struggling with severe anxiety problems for the last 4-5 years. This uncomfortable feeling has been going for so long that I can't even remember the last time I felt totally comfortable. The only times I feel more or less relaxed is when I'm locked in my room and don't have to see or talk with people. Whenever I go outside I'm unable to calm down and act natural. I become very self-conscious and paranoid about other people. It's almost like an automatic switch inside of my brain that unleashes all these negatives thoughts that overwhelm me, stress me out and infuriate me. This makes me very defensive and hostile-looking which pushes other people away. I have a permanent frown on my face, I can't smile or show any emotion other than anger. This makes it impossibe for me to make friends or approach women. I wish I could just be myself without having to feel any shame about what other people may think about me.

My main fear when I'm in public is that I will meet or be noticed by someone I know, causing them to make false assumptions about me depending on my location and situation. E.g if someone sees me walking in a bad neighborhood, I'm afraid of them assuming I'm a criminal When I am in public WITH a friend, however, it's much easier and I get less anxiety. I freak out when I am called on by the teacher to read or present in front of the class. When my class is taking turns reading out loud, I will quickly skim through the paragraph before everyone else to prepare in case I get picked to read next When I present to the class, I stutter and can't keep my body still (moving my hands excessively, walking around, etc.) Unless they are my close friends or family, I stutter and tend to look down when I'm having a conversation with another person. I get anxiety when making or receiving phone calls. When I receive a call, I ignore it and later text the person saying that I was busy I reread my emails and make revisions several times before sending them. When I want to say something out loud to another person or a group of people, I repeat the sentence in my head a few times to make sure the wording doesn't sound wrong. I hate standing up in class, whether it's to go to the restroom or to give something to the teacher. When I'm talking to someone, it helps to stand a couple of feet away from them. I'd love to wear a hood and thick clothing to feel secure, but I can't due to fear of being judged for what I wear. Talking and interacting with girls is significantly harder than with guys When my family is going somewhere, I make an excuse not to go, such as homework. I have an unreasonable fear of having bad breath. I brush my teeth before I go out to social events, always keep sugarfree gum with me, and avoid eating sugary food to prevent bad breath. I can make myself LOOK confident if I try, but it's difficult. During lunch, I'd rather sit with others than sit alone to avoid looking like I don't have any friends. I don't have a license yet, but I don't think I would be able to drive at all because of the pressure. I could never sit in a plane next to a stranger I was never bullied in my childhood but I had a friend who would make me feel unworthy and less than others I have a loving family and my parents, who I look up to, are not shy at all I was not like this until I became 13 y/o I'm apologize if this was a long post. Do I have social phobia or am I just shy? Please feel free to ask any questions\", 'What is this? (x-post /r/Anxiety). Decides to put this here because I only got one response. Anyway, here goes: I feel like some kind of imposter here, I haven\\'t been diagnosed with anything, but I know there is something wrong with me. Where to begin... So, I think I could be described as a quiet, shy, introverted (I know being shy and introverted are two different things), and reserved person. I always have been, so far, at least. I\\'m 15. It goes a little further than that though. I\\'m incredibly socially awkward, and I really don\\'t know what to say a lot of the time. If a conversation dies out, I feel like it\\'s all my fault because I\\'m not interesting. I\\'ve avoided Skype calls with a close friend numerous times because of this, and I feel like every time I decline a request to call, they\\'ll stop being my friend. Like they\\'ll hate me or something, even though I know that\\'s bizarre. Also, I have friends I\\'ve met online that I\\'ve known for well over a year now, and I even feel uncomfortable talking in calls with them, so I usually lie and say that I can\\'t talk right now, and just type instead. I also hate going outside, ever since I was a kid. My sister loved(s) going to the park; I didn\\'t want to, I wanted stay inside all day, but my mum made me go. But recently it\\'s gotten worse. A lot worse. I took a day off school two weeks ago. I pretended to be sick. Long story short, I\\'m not exactly in a happy place right now, and I just couldn\\'t go in. Fake smiling, fake laughing - I was sick of it. Then there\\'s also, what I can only presume, are panic/anxiety attacks (quickened breathing, shaky hands, tight throat). Which is kind of why I\\'m here. I\\'ve only ever had one of these (I think) months ago, way back at the start of 2016 in my house. And that sucked like hell. Now I\\'ve started to get them at school. They usually occur just after a maths lesson has finished. I just get this overwhelming feeling of fear, and all I could think was \"What the fuck is wrong with me? I need to get out of here now,\" and \"There\\'s nothing wrong with you, it\\'s all in your head; man up.\" \"Man up\" - that phrase has been drilled into me. After the bell goes and we get to leave, I usually go straight to the toilets in one of cubicles and stay there for 5-10 minutes (during break/lunch break) to calm down. Then I have to leave so I don\\'t look weird and my friend(s) ask me where I\\'ve been. That brings me to today, I pretended to be sick again today to have the day off. Same reasons - unhappy and panic/anxiety attacks. I also feel constantly uncomfortable in social situations (so, all 6 hours of school. Yay), I have a big fear of judgement of others and base my self-worth on that - which is why I have very little of that, but also self-esteem and confidence. I only ever feel normal (mostly) when alone, and even then I\\'m thinking how I have to get up at an absurdly early time in the morning to go to a school I hate and talk to people when I\\'d rather shut myself in all day. Weekends are a goddamn blessing; I get to sleep the day away. I\\'m amazed how I\\'ve managed to even keep two friends and have them both even like me enough to want to talk and hang out with me. There\\'s clearly something not right but I\\'m not sure what. I\\'ve taken two days off school because of people...I know that sounds pathetic, but that\\'s because I probably am. Am I over-dramatizing this? I should also add that no one else in the world knows about this except me (duh), a close online friend, and well, you. Anyway, thanks for reading.', ' High school baggage (self-therapy; long rambling). I\\'m trying to work through some stuff in my own head, so no one needs to read or reply to this. I visited my high school on the pretext of seeing the new renovations, but I actually just wanted to feel like I could walk everywhere without fear. Even though I graduated five years ago, I still felt nervous. Even though the school is on winter break and campus was empty, I found myself hesitant to walk where there were usually people. Even five years later, my automatic reaction was to walk away the moment I thought I heard someone and to put on my practiced facial expression as if someone were watching me. I was still scared to walk around campus, but I made myself do it (albeit there was no one there), telling myself that this is my campus too, that I didn\\'t have to run away and that I have a right to be there. High school was about hiding. During lunch, I sat behind pillars and bushes, in bathrooms, classrooms and locker rooms. I walked quickly from class to class with my head down. I stayed in a corner in the library as much as I could. I didn\\'t have a single friend in high school in spite of my initial efforts to reach out to people. I joined a soccer team; I quit because of the name-calling. I joined voice lessons; I quit because of the name-calling. On my first day of class in my first year, someone came to sit next to me, but his friend pulled him away saying loudly, \"I\\'m not sitting next to *her*.\" These were all people I\\'d never met, I was totally new to the school district. In math class, my table group never worked problems with me. Instead, they ignored me, talking to each other in another language, sometimes about me, not even realizing that I understood everything they said. A few times, I tried to sit with people during lunch, people I had met and managed to talk to in a friendly way during class, but they all got up and left together each time. Of course I had to save my dignity and stop acting desperate. From day one, I was marked as a pariah. I don\\'t know why or how I became the constant outcast except that I was new to the district. But for four years, I couldn\\'t eat before or at school. I developed a binge-eating disorder, which still comes up once in a while. I shut down and did nothing but academically-oriented work, never going to a social situation, except prom, which my parents forced me to attend. Those same people I had talked to before said I could join them, probably because it would be rude to say no outright. But of course they walked away and avoided me the whole event. Visiting the high school campus was painful. Objectively, I know that all of this is in the past and that I should be able to move on. But the reality is that the SA that I face every day is in large part due to the ostracizing and name-calling from high school. The past is still a living part of the present. I thought that by visiting campus, I could get some closure. Instead, it\\'s dredged up all the stuff I try not to think about. The only thing I can say is that I can see a bit more clearly what my behavioral pattern is--hiding and making myself as invisible as possible because if they can\\'t see you, they can\\'t hurt you. But I\\'ve gotten so used to making myself as invisible and unobtrusive as possible that I can\\'t make friends. I\\'ve never dated. The one time I mustered the courage to ask a guy to hang out with me, he invited his roommate to join, making it a group activity and proceeded to leave me with her. Writing that out makes me realize how calculated that was; that was actually quite mean. I\\'m always on the defense from people and their attention. But all of this isolation hurts. I\\'m hurting myself in the present because other people hurt me in the past and because I\\'m convinced that people will hurt me in the future. I don\\'t know how I can try anymore. It must be so nice to be normal and be able to share the world with people, without fear, instead of feeling like you\\'re imprisoned in your own head. ', 'Need advice/20f/social anxiety/new country/no friends/no independence/language barrier/ ruining myself and relationship. I don\\'t know where to start or what to say or how much to say but all I know is that I need help Long story short I moved countries for my boyfriend and a couple years later and I think I\\'ve gained some unhealthy habits and I have huge social anxiety now and feel completely vulnerable and alone and it\\'s ruining my relationship as well as myself. Here is some more background info for anyone who may be able to give me any good advice, I would really appreciate it. I\\'m a 20 yr old female and I fell in love a couple years ago and moved countries for my boyfriend, we are still together and i believe things are much better than before. You have no idea how hard this move has been on me. I used to be so happy and outgoing and have my close few friends and old high school friends. I used to do my own thing, I used to be so independent. First let me say that I love my boyfriend incredibly and we both plan to spend the rest of our lives together and have a family, build our home and we are already working on our business together. It has been a couple years and I still don\\'t know how to speak the language here. I do not have a car or a drivers license and I work from home. I feel I am so reliant on him for everything. I feel I am so needy and attached to him always. We spend every day together and yes we take our space but I wouldn\\'t want it any different. Now with the crime etc here and with how I stand out we both aren\\'t comfortable with me taking the bus let alone running in the area we live. This is another problem. I know a group of people that speak English and we sort of get along but I feel no matter what I do not click with any of the girls here. I have always had troubles being friends with girls though, they don\\'t seem to take a liking to me and I\\'ve accepted that and continue to be as nice and genuine as possible. I used to have a bunch of guy friends but now that I am in a serious relationship ( I should note this is my first relationship ) I don\\'t think that it is very appropriate to make close guy friends but I get along well with my boyfriend\\'s friends though. With the language I\\'ve been excusing it and excusing it and Now that I live here I feel I have become shy because I hate being laughed at for not knowing the language, I get so much anxiety when we are out and there is lots of people and my boyfriend is talking to people I don\\'t seem to recognize or know, or even people I do know and it\\'s in their own language and I just close in and feel so alone and so invisible to everyone. I try to learn a bit but guess I get frustrated and shut down easily. I am forcing myself to pay for 1on1 private lessons though and I feel this is a huge block that is one of the main problems for me. I hate being the center of attention as well and I think that I am a very insecure woman now that I am in this relationship. The way I think about myself can at times be terrible, I\\'m great for overthinking and my poor boyfriend gets to deal with it all. I know that from a young age because of dad issues or whatever I have abandonment problems and although I think my boyfriend would never and know that he has never done anything behind my back involving another woman I still feel like I will lose him at times and I feel like i am not good enough. As you can probably tell I have serious insecurities about myself, what I believe are abandonment issues, social anxiety, a language barrier, I am too dependent on him, uncomfortable to walk the streets alone, a hard time making friends, a hard time even going out of my comfort zone, sometimes suffer from bouts of depression etc and it is hard on both me and my boyfriend. I broke down yesterday because I was holding it all in for so long and I didn\\'t want my boyfriend to know because honestly he is so used to me crying I feel like it doesn\\'t even phase him but he came in the room and I couldnt hide it anymore and he actually cried with me because he couldn\\'t believe how I was feeling about myself etc. But today we went to an event and it was so overwhelming for me there was so many people and I started panicking inside and tried to keep it to myself but he sensed it and then as we were leaving I asked if he wanted to get a beer before we went to this other event (work) and he said no and that we had to go to that event right away but then he saw his friend opened a bar and we went to say hi and the guys completely ignored me and they all talked to eachother in their language and again it hit me and I felt so worthless to be standing there just looking at the ground trying to keep it together and then he asks me if we can have a beer with them and that stung because I just got turned down when I asked. We ended up leaving anyway and he noticed I was a little upset and I asked him about the beer thing and the friends who wouldn\\'t even look at me and then he started getting pissed off and He makes this comment \"why can\\'t we go just one day without it turning bad \" and I started crying and there was a point I was upset with him and said fuck you and had a short rant and he said \"you don\\'t even try to get better\" \"I don\\'t deserve this\" \"I can\\'t even say hi to my friends\", he totally lost his cool and was yelling and speeding at times and I just kept fucking crying, he also asked why for once I can\\'t make it all about me and even though i feel he took things way too far I understand and I feel like a peice of shit and am so upset with myself. Please why can\\'t I be fucking normal again I feel almost trapped right now but when I\\'m good things are amazing but no when he tells me that stuff I just feel like it would be better if I just left for good. I am hurting so much. Please someone help talk to me I have no one to go to and he was the only one I poured my heart and soul to. He knows everything about me, but when he goes and says this I feel like he just doesn\\'t care and I feel I\\'d be better off gone. But when I think about it he is my everything. He is all I have. I am nothing.', \"What is it?. Hi, I'm a 22 year old male from the UK. It has just hit me that I might be suffering from some form of social anxiety. I know it's not something you can easily diagnose, as being shy is common and often just a stage in someones life, but I think it's more than shyness for me. I can speak to other people fine, and will smile at the barista or laugh with somebody if the situation is so, so I wouldn't class myself as shy. I can hold a conversation with a stranger well enough. What I think is my problem is that I always feel like I have to prepare myself before I go out. Regardless of how well I think I'm dressed, or whether I have a fresh haircut or whatever, I feel unready to be in the gaze of others if I'm not physically and mentally prepared. If I don't know that I'm being looked at/am in the presence of others or if I'm not prepared mentally to be looked at/to be in the presence of others, I feel very uncomfortable. Don't ask me what my mental preparation is, because I have no clue. My physical preparation is fairly normal for a young male, it's just the mental side. I also just always feel like I'm being watched when I'm walking in public. Like everyone I pass stares at me for a second longer than they do at other people, because I don't fit in. Truth is, I look 'normal'. I'm from an ethnic minority, but who the hell cares about that (especially at uni). I don't think I look particularly attractive or unattractive. The issue came to fruition in Uni, when I began to be out and about more generally. I was a bit overweight, but not by majorly so, and my self-consciousness with that made me hate being in public. I'd want to be out of sight as soon as possible, and it was like a massive burden was lifted off my shoulders when I'd reach my room. Since then I've lost a lot of weight so that I'm really like any other young adult male (if a bit on the skinny side, but that's because I'm into running), and yet the feeling of being out of place still hasn't changed. I'm still at uni (in my final year), and it has improved a lot. Losing weight helped, and generally becoming more comfortable with how I look. I think that was one of my major problems. I was very self conscious with my looks. I hated the way I looked with glasses because I thought it made me look even weirder, to the extent that I wouldn't wear glasses when my prescription is such that I should wear them all the time. I'd rather be basically blind and live in a blur than to look that extra bit weirder. That continued on for a long while, until I realised that it was affecting how people I knew thought of me because they'd pass right by me or wave at me and I'd blank them because I couldn't see them. That's different now, I think I've come to terms with my image. I look different, but I'm fine with that because we all do, and I'm no beast or whatever. I'm a lot more comfortable in public too and will go out even when I don't particularly need to, but there's still that something that makes me falter before I go out in the morning, and sometimes I don't even want to leave my room. That is what has made me think that there's something more to my condition than just having body image issues. There's no better feeling than getting back into my room and being out of sight after a long day at uni. I read somewhere that this is just a symptom of being an introvert, but I don't think I am your usual introvert. I enjoy meeting new people, and sometimes I really crave it. It's not social interactions that exhaust me, because I get this need to hide away after simply being out and having not even talked to anyone. So is this the right place for me? Do you think I have social anxiety issues? I don't think it is the body image issues that I've had in years gone by, but then again I've never really looked for professional help for anything like this. I don't know.. honestly I'd just be glad if there was someone else who had the same issues, someone that I could to talk to about them? Thanks for reading all of that. It's the first time I've ever actually typed out my feelings about it, and really is a relief in itself, so thanks for being a part of that even if there is nothing you can suggest.\", ' SA is dangerous if you do parkour or any extreme sport. I\\'ve fallen twice in two months, first time I sprained my ankle (I grade) and I did\\'t know I had SA then, I thought I just had bad luck, but I found out a little bit later I\\'m suffering from this, idk how much, I think at least I suffer from a mild social anxiety. So I fell because I was distracted and anxious because there were people near me while I was training. And today I fell again, although I\\'ve been working on my social anxiety, I still get anxious, and here\\'s the MISTAKE: I tried to fight it, I knew I was anxious, because I was training next to a restaurant and people could look at me, so I just kept going, like saying to myself \"SA isn\\'t gonna stop me from training as the last time I fell\". Don\\'t do that, I\\'m fucked up again, this time the wrist and the shin, I\\'ve learned that when I feel anxious it\\'s better to fight it but mentally, and stop doing pakour, or whatever sport you may be doing, go to another place where you\\'re alone, or just be there and fight anxiety, but stop training, don\\'t jump and just try to snap yourself out of it, because you\\'ve to acknowledge this is an issue, this will disappear if you want to, but it takes time, don\\'t rush it ', \"I have no redeeming qualities. I'm 16 years old and a junior, but because of my social anxiety I'm extremely unaccomplished.

I can't join clubs because I also won't know anyone there, and if I do, it's usually an acquaintance and I don't want to bother them. It's even hard for me to go outside alone, because I feel like the world is looking at me and criticizing me, but I can't text many people because I'm so boring and don't have many developed areas of conversation. I can't even find a job because the act of going somewhere, telling how much of a failure I am but still begging for a job is humiliating.

Part of it, is I'm too anxious to really participate. I stand in the back, watching the pit, but too uncomfortable to just let go and give into the catharsis. And then, outside smoking or in between set, I'm daunted by all the people. I'm horrified of being so new to the environment (at 24.) Sometimes, when anxious, I stare without meaning to and dissociate and it's put a lot of social distance between me and others in the past. In really any other environment, I'm not afraid of a collective group being so judgemental, nor am I so self conscious. Maybe it has something to do with how a music snob as a teenager and maybe I'm projecting that, but I feel there's more to it.

It's so frustrating because each class I miss makes me even more afraid to go to next one, and I haven't even attended my one of my classes at all yet (I'm pretty sure it's a super small one). I'm so worried my professors will casually call me out or ask if I'm caught up or something. The worst is when for a short moment I feel confident or reassure myself that it'll be fine-- just go to class-- but then I revert to dreading it all over again shortly after. \", \"Why am I like this?. Hi everyone, I'm a 21 year old software engineering student who feels funny saying that because I don't go to lectures and failed my last year because I didn't even go to exams. I have such grand ideas that I don't seem to have the energy to follow through with. I've barely left the house apart from for school, food etc since I was about 17 years old. I spend all day on the Internet and can't even tell you what exactly I've done all day because every day melts into the next. I used to be so sociable, fit and happy. Now I just glide through life day to day always in the same numb mood. I can't seem to conjure up the sense of immediacy for things that are important to me as I used to. I seem to find it easy to skip things that are important to me only to put it out of my mind minutes later. I have this big project idea only to barely have the energy to work on it and to later abandon it. I've always found it easy to make friends only in the last few years drift away from them because I can never find the nerve to go out. I remember a very specific moment in my first year of university where a friend asked me to go to his birthday night out. I had this weird thought in my head like he was trying to trick me, to laugh at me. Obviously, this was silly but these thoughts have become more intrusive since. I can be walking outside and hear people laughing and I immediately worry if they're laughing at me. I hate being like this. I sometimes kid to myself that I like life this way but the truth is I just don't think about the day to day. Putting whatever is wrong out of my mind seems to be my coping strategy. Today, I was going to phone the Doctor's for an appointment so I could explain my situation but I ended up not doing it because once again I convinced myself that they'll say I'm overreacting and that Im being lazy and just need to try harder. I know this isn't true because my behaviour is not okay but I seemed to convince myself anyway. Sorry about the ranty post but I just needed to do this.\", ' My neighborhood is hell. I have to take both of my dogs (seperately) for a walk everyday, which means even on bad days when I can\\'t even keep my head up or look at people. I\\'ve been forcing myself through this for two years and all those bad days have given me a shady reputation in my neighborhood. At least in my own head it has. I live in a wealthy gated community where most people dress well, are friendly and outgoing, and are healthy minded. So a person like me who is somewhat poor and extremely anxious in public and has a permanent frown, stands out. Today I felt like shit but I knew I had to take my dogs out before nightfall. I knew I should\\'ve worn my shades and took a cigarette with me but for whatever reason I didn\\'t. The whole time I walked with my head very low and anytime my dog stopped in front of somebodies house I tensed up and just stared at the ground because I worry people are looking at me and I\\'m unable to move or look around. Two little girls who once pet my dog crossed the street behind me and I heard one of them say \"My dad says not to trust him.\" This validated my theory that I am seen as creepy. There\\'s nothing I can do either because I know people think I\\'m weird which makes me more nervous and thus I come across even weirder.

I have to walk to and from school every morning. There’s nobody else walking outside except for the occasional dog walker and I feel like all the cars are staring at me, examining my every move, and judging me.

Everyone drives everywhere. ', \"Has your anxiety gotten worse as you got older or was there a time where you used to be normal?. My anxiety began to get worse six years ago when I was 14 during my freshman year of high school. I began to have a hard time making eye contact with people, becoming a people-pleaser, being overly sensitive to how people look at me, wanting everyone to like me, being self-conscious about the way I walk, being unable to relax in public, walking into a room full of people, going out for a walk, getting nervous driving in the car because I feel like other drivers are staring at me and judging me, etc. Before this I didn't have all these problems. I was able to live life more comfortably and I was able to make friends and enjoy social interactions. Towards the end of my freshman year of high school, my anxiety just got severe one day out of nowhere, and it got bad from there. I have gotten a bit better since then, but I am still not at a place where I want to be at. I miss the days when I was able to enjoy life more, without being nervous all the time. When I look at old photos of my self during this period, I can't help but cry because it brings me back to a time when I enjoyed life and was much happier than I am now. I just want to know if any of you guys can relate?\", \"Me and my anxiety. I am 24 year old person with social anxiety. Although it has not been diagnosed but after a lot of online research, I came to this conclusion. I also feel depressed and sometimes it lasts for months. My depression comes and go. This has been going on for at least 7 years now. My anxiety hasn't had any severe impact on my physical being. I have been generally a good perfomer in terms of grades. I also have a good paying job But socially, it is as miserable as it can get. I have zero social skills and I have a very hard time connecting with peoples. I have had friends in college, but I lost in touch with them. Everyone got busy with their own thing and also I started avoiding them. Although, I made some friends at my work place, but there was no real connection. Instead of calling them friends, i should call them acquaintance. I am also not very close with my family and I have no one to share these feelings with. Even the trivial things such as shopping and going out are very hard for me. Whenever I am surrounded by people, I have a constant feeling of being judged. I know this is all irrational and most of it is in my head. So after working for 2.5 years, I thought it's time to make some changes. I made a brave decision of moving to a new city and taking a new job. I was excited, hoping that I would meet new people, make some friends. Hopefully find someone special. But it was quite the contrary, I feel more miserable here. The new job sucks, people at my work place are not so friendly. I don't know anyone in the city, I don't think I have enough courage to go outside alone. I just wanted someone to listen.\", '22M, live abroad is killing me. Hello reddit, I moved to Europe, when I was 14. My mother already lived there for 3 years and I lived in Ukraine with my grandparents. I was never really asked if I wanted to move but I also didn\\'t think about living in other country and leaving everything behind as a big problem. First half of the year was a horror. I spoke to almost no one. I learned German for a year prior to moving to Europe and it was not enough for me to instantly make friends. Also, the last couple of years at school in Ukraine were pretty difficult for me, as I was constantly bullied. I was weak and skinny and didn\\'t know how to protect myself. But even then, I didn\\'t have any other problems outside school. So, back to Europe, from my first days here, I tried to speak to my new schoolmates as good as I could. But I also started to shield myself from people. Like, if I try to look unfriendly or dangerous, nobody will try to make fun of me. I behaved myself like this, when I was in public. It\\'s not, like I was being impolite to people, but I tried to always have this \"don’t mess with me look\", if this makes any sense. However, knew country, new rules. I didn\\'t have to be afraid of being attacked physically. Instead I couldn’t argue or counter jokes from my classmates. This time I was vulnerable not, because I was weak, but because I didn\\'t know the language well. I also went to a second school simultaneously. My week looked like this: twice a week a returned home at 8pm, because of two schools, where I hadn\\'t time to go home between them. The rest of time I had to study. My first winter holidays, which I spent back in Ukraine, were both a relieve and a horror. I had to go privately to a German teacher almost daily. In first summer I had about 3-4 teachers to prepare me for both schools. All this was awful, but stilly I had my friends at home and was overall happy. **Until one day it started.** I was going back from my German teacher (who was a really nice person, and who taught me really a lot grammar, that helped me immense with my German, so it\\'s not like I totally hated learning German). But let\\'s go back. So, I was going back from my \"class\". I was a usual way for me: just a bit uphill along the road towards the bus stop. Suddenly it was more difficult for me to breath and I felt like, if I would start breath more, people would notice it and, that I looked really awkward. After that, I drove back home and felt myself completely normal. But this situation repeated itself more and more during that summer. I started to notice the way I breathe even on my way to the teacher. I think, this is where it all started. As I was back in Europe, I started being conscious about how I move my feet or my arms. I was always aware of where I was looking at, how my lip was positioned. I didn\\'t know how to look in people\\'s eyes, whether I looked unfriendly etc. I still had no friends at European school, I haven\\'t had any walks which I had constantly with my friends back in Ukraine. It looked like the kids where either going out the way I didn\\'t understand or the didn\\'t do it at all. Years went by, the only time I enjoyed my life, was when I had winter or summer holidays and was back in Ukraine. There I could talk to people, I even managed to make new friends, with whom I still have good contact. I just felt myself normal. After about 2-3 years later, I managed to tell my mother, that something was wrong with me. (It\\'s not easy for a kid to admit, that something is wrong with his head! And I didn\\'t have a good connection to my mother at that time) She took me to her psychiatrist. I was prescribed with some weak antidepressant. I guess I helped with my mood a bit, but it had done shit to my social anxiety. I just tried to suppress the way I felt and had from time to time breakdowns. My only dream was to finish school and University and leave that fucking country. Since no one here needed me, I decided, I would manage everything on my own. I finished both schools. It may sound like it isn\\'t bad after all. Well, no. All this time it felt like I lost that autopilot and had to manually control the way I move, or where to look at the person I speak to. I still didn\\'t feel connected to people around me. I could not make jokes, which the class would find funny. I didn\\'t speak to anyone outside my class. I felt isolated and people around me perceived me the same way. I wasn\\'t interested in my future carrier or, in what to study. My only dream was to leave this country. Instead of leaving, I thought, that it would be a waste to give up an opportunity to study in Europe. I also didn\\'t want to disappoint my relatives. And, to be honest, I was afraid to change anything, go back home and take exams to be able study there. I also didn\\'t want to look like an idiot, coming back, when everybody else wanted to leave Ukraine for better future. I think, I should have done that. If not for studying, but just to have a year off, relax, get rid of SA and may be come back to study. (It\\'s important to mention, that most of the social anxiety symptoms weaken, after I get back home for, at least a month. But even from the first day on, I always felt myself a lot better ) But I haven\\'t done that. Instead I thought, I could power myself thought University, get a bachelor and leave this fucking country forever. I tried studying two different faculties, I hoped, that at the University I would finally able to connect to new people and have fun (so that I would even decide to stay in Europe). That never happened. I tried to study mechanical engineering, but from the beginning the math was just unmanageable for me and I couldn’t find a group to study together. Well, if I can\\'t have fun talking to someone new, since I am to anxious, I can\\'t fit in a group to study, because you must speak there and, like, make friends :) In Europe there are no persistent classes at the Universities. You either have a lection in a huge auditorium or have smaller classes, with 20-40 persons for something like practicing math, where you must solve your prepared homework in front of whole group. I had to do it twice and I felt almost like I am fainting. The most time I spent at home, where I didn\\'t have to feel constant fear and be in fight or flight mode. During one summer in Ukraine I met my current girlfriend. Later, I decided to study CS at a so-called University of Applied Science, where after three years of fixed classes I would have my bachelor and could go back to Ukraine. I had to wait almost a year to sign me up for that University. In the meantime, I found a job, where I am basically all levels of support and a junior sysadmin at same time. (Back in European school a had a specialization in IT because of which we had one year more of school. And the specialization made me hate IT so much, that I didn\\'t realize, that I actually like it) The job was fantastic the only \"problem\" was, that every year in August they organized an event for different political, technical, economical, etc topics) and I had to be there for month. During that time I had both to do IT Stuff and help prepare everything for the conference (cheap student labor :D) But that one month of constant work (not 8/5) just crushed me. My anxiety escalated to some new levels, I was constantly stressed. I was still extra anxious after work but also looked forward to study something I wanted, the way I thought could be the best for me. I expected, that only mathematics would be hard for me, but I also knew you that it would not be as difficult as in a normal University. I was so fucking wrong about everything. The amount of information was huge. We had constant projects in most of the classes. Moreover, there are supposed to be a lot of group projects. The groups where created all by themselves. I didn\\'t want to be that person without a group and be assigned to somebody I didn\\'t like. All of this made me extremely anxious. Additionally, to my social anxiety I became anxious about everything else. I had to finish every assignment, otherwise I would fail either the final project or the test and then after 3 repeat I would have to repeat the semester. And if you didn\\'t manage to do the first assignment, you will still have to do it, since every next assignment is built upon previous. But most important, I could not manage to make social contacts. I was truly afraid of people. It seems, like we have no similar interests. I still do not know how to connect to them. People in Europe just feel so alien to me. Here in Europe, at my University I felt like a totally different person. I had a lot of breakdowns, I started to cry in the evening and I somehow managed to survive till end of the December and have two weeks off, during which I had to prepare for math exam. But still I was in Ukraine with my girlfriend. What was really killing me is, that I still can perfectly speak to my Ukrainian friends, we can argue, discuss stuff, make fun of each other etc. I have a very nice and understanding girlfriend. I have no problems socializing with them. Or even with meeting new people in Ukraine. After final exams my girlfriend was here with me in Europe, and I still could not relax. When we were in public I constantly was afraid, that I cannot protect her, due to my SA. I also failed two exams and had to retake them after holidays, which made me even more anxious. My doctor gave me some new medication, which, for two weeks seemed to lower my social anxiety and it felt awesome. I already lost my belief that there could be any meds that could really help me. And that belief was restored. The only thing I feared, is that it won\\'t hold, like with all previous things that seemed to help me. And, well, it didn\\'t hold. Something happened during the weekends, I can\\'t explain what it is. But it set me off. My fear became true. The amount of work for the University increased even more and became unbearable to me. At this point I cry for hours. Last week I spent home, constantly anxious. At this point, I don\\'t know what to do. I should have left this country for a year after school. Now I feel, like I can\\'t do it. I also feel, like I am already too old to stop studying and make a pause. I don\\'t think, that I will be able to finish this semester, since I have already fallen behind all the classes. I also get very anxious if I try to study and more anxious after every minor difficulty. My relatives think, that it wasn’t that bad previously. I think, I just was very good at suppressing it and just can\\'t take it anymore. When I felt myself worse, I was usually prescribed new medication, talked to the therapist. After that I felt a bit better and it was enough to continue suppressing and working on \"more\" important things. How long can a person live in a foreign country feeling lonely? I know, that there are people, to whom I am interesting, who like me and care about me. My family is also very supportive. But it\\'s not them, who feel anxious about going outside. It\\'s me who is constantly afraid of masses of people, who can\\'t relax outside and can\\'t protect myself from. Any verbal or nonverbal assault. It almost feels like I am at a warzone. I remember, when I didn\\'t care, how people look at me, ignored if somebody was rude to me. I was able to respond the way I wanted. My head wasn\\'t empty. Now I just slowly fall apart. I am not suicidal, I guess, because I don\\'t believe in the afterlife and am afraid of death. Hell, I even was more relaxed during this two weeks in Ukraine in winter. It wasn\\'t enough time, but I felt myself free on the streets. You probably gonna say, why the hell wouldn\\'t I leave. I know, people would support my decision, I could probably come back later. But I don\\'t won\\'t to let down my girlfriend, even if she says, I don\\'t. I didn\\'t finish a university, so nobody would really want to have me work for them and I want to work, so that I won\\'t be an abuse. I know my options. I just don\\'t have the will to make a decision. I feel like I would get better a bit, like usual and would continue ignoring the problem and maybe in 5 years will slowly finish CS at the University. I just don\\'t think, it is going to be a life. Maybe you together with my girlfriend, it would be easier. I don\\'t know, why am I even writing this. I don’t know, whether it’s a right subreddit. Even posting something on the internet makes me anxious. I do not know, what I want to hear from you. Therefore, I will just share this story and hope for something. I also hope, I won’t be deanonymized by somebody. I just feel, like for the last 8 years, I lived only episodically, not being able to open my true potential or take the opportunities, I was given. And I feel like I am slowly going insane. I hope, that this text isn\\'t totally unreadable, since I guess, English is not even my second language . I tried to keep it as short as possible, but I also don’t expect, that anybody would like to read almost 3k words text. **TL;DR** A lot of autobiographical stuff. Moving abroad as a kid literally ruined my nervous system as the years passed by. And my will was never strong enough to decide, what is really important for me and to change my life the way I really wanted. Now, I just can\\'t take my social anxiety anymore and overcome any difficulties of being an adult. The difference between, who I am in one country, and who I am in another is just killing me.', ' I miss the times I got almost euphoric from being able to sit in front of my computer the rest of the day after being outside for so long..

So, after years of seeing different therapists and everyone recommending exposure therapy, I\\'m not really sure how this is supposed to help. Of course, I\\'ve never said this to any therapist because, well, I don\\'t want to risk frustrating them lol. But yeah, there was even a couple of times where I went out with a therapist and practiced just being anxious in public. It sucked. And I\\'m told that after doing this enough times I should eventually feel better, but...I mean, I go outside every day and have been doing so all my life, only to feel terrible every day. So I just don\\'t really know the point of all this. I\\'m sorry if this is really negative. Basically, I\\'m asking for a more hopeful outlook on all this or maybe some advice as to what else to try, if anyone has some. I\\'m aware of course that some people here complain of this sub being too negative so, I was kind of afraid to post this, but whatever. Roast me if you must; just kinda desperate for some hope. I want to change, but I still have a negative outlook on life and all, so maybe there\\'s someone else out there who can interrupt my brain\\'s negative lecture to me :\\\\.

I\\'ve had this habit for a long time of drastically underestimating my anxiety. I\\'ll make plans to do things, go on a jog, go to the store, etc. I know I\\'ll have a lot of anxiety when I do these things, but... It is always so so so much worse when I actually do it. I heard a quote recently I don\\'t recall where, something along the lines of \"Humans are a species so quick to forget hardships that they\\'ll never learn.\" Actually I\\'m pretty sure it was from one of the Hunger Games movies now that I think about it. After having went to the store last night with the plan of, while I was checking out at the register to ask if the store was currently hiring,  and having like, cardiac arrest levels of anxiety...

I feel I\\'m only worsening it day by day trying to scratch together the motivation to do shit like that. I\\'ve been to a total of 4 different therapist, at one point I even had 2 therapist at once sitting in the same room together with me. I\\'m sure it depends on the person, but for me I\\'d definitely say if anything therapy only worsened my depression. One thing that I have found some sense of solace in in the past is watching a few select people on Youtube just discussing there SA / Depression / Suicidal Ideation. I\\'ve thought about doing that for myself for a long time. I think it would be more beneficial to me then therapy which I stopped going to several months ago. I\\'ve basically been doing nothing with my time for the past several years. It would at least be more progressive then anything I\\'ve tried. If you can actually find somebody\\'s videos you can relate to, as rare as that is, hell finding relatability with anybody whether you\\'re both anxious/ depressed or not... It can be such a comfort having that. Actually listening to somebody talk  and not just reading a post makes it feel more real, like its not so much just all in your head.

If it was less crowded and empty, I'd honestly would have enjoyed this trip so much better! However, the other students aren't familiar with how I am and it's a little exhausting to be around them.

What if they ignore me? What if I don\\'t speak and they think I\\'m ignorant or rude? What if they think I\\'m weird?\" I don\\'t like being observed by people. It makes me uncomfortable. Whenever my father observes me doing something he always judges or makes fun of the way I walk. He tells me I walk very stiff. Because of that I\\'m self-conscious of the way I walk. I always feel like people are judging the way I walk. He gives me a hard time and gets angry with me for looking nervous or uncomfortable when we\\'re out sometimes. This is why I always feel like people can sense that I\\'m nervous and are going to judge me negatively. My father always tells me, \"You have to always watch your surroundings when you\\'re out. You have to walk with your head up and your chest out. You can\\'t appear weak or scared, because people will try to harm you if you appear vulnerable.\" This is why I\\'m always a little paranoid when I\\'m out of my house or being watched by people, because I don\\'t want them to think I\\'m weak and I don\\'t want them to treat me like I\\'m nothing because of it or try to harm me. Sorry if this is all over the place, but all in all I hate being watched or observed by people. This stems from a lot of the things my father tells me. Any advice would be appreciated.

Horrific feeling and panicking until i get to the train platform and rush all the way to the back where its empty. Its so...relaxing.its great. ', 'My Social Anxiety. I wrote this as a bit of a vent for myself but thought I would post it here because I’m sure many of you can relate to this. It’s a bit long but here goes... As a kid I was always “shy.” I wouldn’t make direct eye contact with people most of the time. I would put my head down in situations where I had to meet new people. At family gatherings I would mostly keep to myself only talking to people if they asked me a question. Even then, it would usually be a short response. In school I didn’t have many friends. I had more in elementary than I did in middle school. More in middle school than in high school. I can count the number of real friends I had in high school on one hand. It sure didn’t help that I went to three different high schools throughout my high school years. One of those I left and returned to a few times. I changed elementary schools in the 4th grade, and then changed middle school in the beginning of 7th grade. So it didn’t make it any easier to make friends with people that already had established groups of friends that they had grown up with. I remember hearing this girl in my class talking to her friends about how it was weird that we keep leaving and coming back. (We being my sister and I) In high school people thought I was rude or mean because I didn’t talk to anyone. The truth is I just didn’t know how. I wanted to have friends. I didn’t want to be popular or anything but who doesn’t want to have their own circle of friends and people to relate to? Even the people I “dated” didn’t get to know the real me because I was too afraid to be myself. I don’t know why I felt this way. I’m sure it has something to do with my developmental years but I’m not an expert. Going to school every day was hell. Thinking that everyone is judging you all the time or talking about you or laughing at you is rough. Being made fun of for being “too skinny” or “too quiet” or “too rude” is rough. I would walk in every morning with headphones in and make a beeline for the classroom and I would leave the same way. I wonder if you know what this social anxiety feels like? It can come and go at anytime. Some days are worse than others. Some days it’s insomnia, heart racing, palms sweating, mind racing. It’s uncontrollable and it feels like you’re mind is going to explode from the craziness inside it. Some days it lurks in the background. On those days it’s manageable. You can go to the movies or to the mall and feel somewhat okay. Some days it’s canceling plans you’ve had for weeks because you just can’t bring yourself to leave the house and face human interaction. You can’t face the feeling of everyone’s eyes on you and the negativity that you assume is associated with you. You can’t force yourself to act like you’ve got it together in front of other people. It’s too hard to put on a smile and make conversation. The hardest part for me is self doubt. I’m always second guessing what I’m doing. Always thinking someone is watching. Always afraid of messing up. It’s also people thinking I’m lazy because I don’t work and when I do it never lasts too long. Even the job I have now which is a good job with good pay, it’s hard. It’s hard forcing myself out of bed in the morning knowing for the next twelve hours I’m going to be mentally exhausted which is much worse than the physical exhaustion. That may seem like an over statement to you but it’s not for me. Walking down the long walk ways at work hoping no ones walking the opppsite direction. What do I do when I cross someone’s path? Do I make eye contact? Do I look straight ahead? Do I smile? Nod? Wave? Am I rude if I just look down or away? These are all thoughts going through my head. As irrational as they are, they’re real. What happens when everyone is standing in a group talking? Do I go and try to be part of the group? But then I have to talk to people. But if I don’t I just look like a weirdo or like I think I’m too good to talk to them. What if I think I know how to do something at work but I’m not sure and I’m afraid to mess up so I ask someone for help? Then I feel dumb because I should’ve just done what I thought was right in the first place. Sometimes I avoid doing things altogether just so I can’t fail and look dumb in front of my co workers. But doing nothing also makes me look lazy and like I’m not a team player. Do you understand the problem? This is also the reason I don’t drive. I know I’m capable of driving and would probably enjoy it, but I’m terrified of taking the driving test. I can’t bring myself to go and be on the spot like that. I don’t even want to drive in front of my fiancé so how am I supposed to do it for a test in front of a stranger? Everyone tells me you need to get your license. It’s such an obvious and easy thing for everyone else but for me it’s the hardest thing in the world. It’s the same reason I wouldn’t cut the grass when I was younger. I didn’t want people to watch me out in the front yard anyone passing by could and I didnt want to mess up and cut it poorly. I hope this will help you understand what this anxiety is like for me. It’s not getting better. In fact it’s gotten worse. I’m getting more general anxiety now. Unreasonable worrying about things I have no control over. Checking to see if my loved ones are still breathing when they sleep or worrying about getting into car accidents. Living with this anxiety is getting harder and harder. All I want to do is give up and just lay in bed at home in a safe place all the time. I’m looking into getting help because this is too much to handle and I just want to feel normal for the first time in my life. Thanks for reading.', 'Does anyone get paranoid with more than one car driving behind you?. I just got my learners permit in May 2018 (at age 21). I’ve been slowly pushing myself. I, first, started driving, literally, down the block and back (on a quiet side street). My second time, I drove on a longer, but, still quiet side street and back. Third time, I drove at night around 11pm with my mom and went on roads with street lights, but stayed near my house. Fourth time (at 11pm), I drove by myself and drove farther than before. I’ve driven a few more times after that, but, I want to get to my main point. As with most of you, I hate large groups of people. When I see someone walking behind me on the same side of the street, I try to out-walk them or cross the street to avoid this anxiety. The same applies to driving. Today, I decided to drive on a busy-ish road during the day. I practiced my reversing and before I went inside, I did one run of going on a busy road during the morning rush. Boy, I haven’t even scratched the surface of being a driver. As I get on the road with street lights, there’s 6 or so cars driving behind me. I’m looking in the left side mirror, saying “Oh my gosh, oh my gosh”, with my heart beating. Then, there comes this truck who looked like he was trying to get me to go faster. I’m mumbling to myself “Pass me because I’m not going faster.” He does pass me. After I did a U-turn and started to drive back to my house, this van was close to me like the truck from before. It looked like they wanted to pass me and they could have because there were no other cars coming from the other side. They were still following me and I was getting nervous, so, I pulled to the right and let them pass. I couldn’t deal with that. I quickly got to my house before I would have had a nervous breakdown. How do you people do it everyday?', \" Why cant I leave the house?. Something, that I'm guessing is anxiety, drives me to the point where I stay home and play video games everyday. I've been wanting to go to the gym, park but I cant pinpoint this feeling of being a little afraid to go. I'm not sure why that is because I do enjoy going out, maybe I've grown use to the habit of staying home? Not sure why I have to try so hard to convince myself to leave the house. \", \"I can't water the garden because my neighbours are watching.... I share a house and a garden with a bunch of (friendly) neighbours and this time around everybody has to water the garden almost daily for about 3 weeks or so. I was just halfway through doing it but then I noticed that my neighbours are sitting in their balcony looking at the garden, which gave me a horrible feeling in my stomach - SA kicks in. I was afraid that they are gonna judge the way I water it and think I'm stupid or whatever, so I quit. This was about 10 min ago and I'm currently sitting in my room writing this and wondering what the hell to do. I skipped the last day because I was exhausted, which means that I **HAVE TO** do it today. Otherwise my neighbours will be pissed because the plants are dry. I'm so afraid of going back out there. I guess I'll just sit here and hope that they are gone within minutes. Fuck my life\", \"I feel like I'm dying. Hey friends!I hope you are all doing great.

So basically I am at this one-month summer camp (yes, one month of hell) to learn a language. And I can't get out and go away. I signed up because 6 months ago my SA wasn't that bad so I thought why not. Here I am, instead of enjoying this camp, I am dealing with cripping anxiety and depression. It's been only a week and everyone has made their group friends and let me say this: I met a few cool people and became their friend in the first days. Now they made new friends and gave up on me. Fuck this is hard. I feel so alone. Everyone has a group of friends and I'm stuck alone. I am around people 24/7 since I live in a campus. I can't get out. I am too scared to go outside. And when we go on trips, I have panic attacks because I hate being alone. I feel like I'm dying. I really want to disappear. My mind can't bear this anxiety. I am supeeer scared to talk to people :( Anyway sorry for the rant. It's just I can't live with these thoughts anymore so I had to share them. Love you all.\", 'My 8th grade History teacher ignoring me 7-8 years ago has traumatized me. Advice?. This is going to be a little long, but please read. I am suffering. To give you guys a little background, I\\'m a 20 year old male. I suffer with social anxiety disorder and I pretty much had it my whole life. However this incident has made my anxiety worse, and I\\'ve never really recovered since. When I was young, I used to always be a teacher\\'s pet. Teachers used to love me, and I was always their favorite student. I used to always get special acknowledgment from teachers because of this. In 8th grade (2010-2011 school year) I had a history teacher. At the beginning of the school year he would acknowledge me and give me attention. However, one day after lunch I was walking to his classroom to get to his class. I was down the hall and he was at the door. I guess I was walking a little slow and he yelled, \"Devin hurry up!\". (Looking back on it he didn\\'t even say it in an angry way and I\\'m mad at myself for letting that get to me.) Ever since that incident I felt like he was mad at me and he didn\\'t like me. Because of this I was always desperate for his approval again. However, I never got it! He never acknowledged me or called on me in class ever! He would acknowledge all of his students except for me. I would stare him down in the hallway or in his classroom hoping he would say something to me, but he never did. I didn\\'t like how every one else got attention from him except for me. I even raised my hand once in his class to answer a question, and he looked at me and didn\\'t call on me! All I wanted was his approval. I have never been treated like this by a teacher before, so it was hard for me to take. I was so used to being a teacher\\'s favorite student. He pretty much ignored me the entire school year. Because of this incident, I\\'m now desperate for approval from everyone! When I go shopping I get upset when an employee chooses to acknowledge the person I\\'m with and not me. When people choose to acknowledge someone else over me I get jealous! I struggle making eye contact with people! I\\'m very sensitive to how people look at me and what people think about me! It\\'s hard for me to relax in public! It\\'s like I want approval from everyone! If I don\\'t get it I get upset and feel like there\\'s something wrong with me. Before the incident with my History teacher, I never had these issues! I\\'m so upset because I feel like if it wasn\\'t for that situation, my anxiety wouldn\\'t be so bad now and I wouldn\\'t have all these issues. Ever since this incident, my anxiety has been horrible! My anxiety was never this bad prior to this incident. I just feel like I will never be the same person I was before 8th grade. I still had anxiety, but I was able to enjoy life more and interacting with people didn\\'t make me so anxious. Now my anxiety is debilitating. Every time I go outside I instantly get nervous. When people look at me or when cars drive by me I get uncomfortable. I just feel like I will never get better and I\\'m going to spend the rest of my life being a people pleaser with crippling anxiety. I\\'m mad at myself that I let a petty incident like this ruin my life! I\\'m sorry for this rant. I just feel like I will never be able to enjoy life to the fullest again. Any advice for me would be appreciated.', \"I'm suffering with debilitating social anxiety. I feel like I'm going to spend the rest of my life living in fear.. Hello, This is going to be a little long, but please take the time to read this. I don’t know what to do. I’m not trying to gain sympathy or pity, I just need to pour my heart out. I’m 20. I’m a boy. I have social anxiety. It’s something I struggled with my whole life. In school I was always quiet because I was very shy. Students used to always ask me “Why are you so quiet?” Teachers would call my parents and tell them “Your son is very quiet.” My parents would get mad at me because of it. When we would visit family, I was always quiet and in my shell. They would ask me, “Why are you so quiet? You can open up.” I was always shy and uncomfortable around family I didn’t see very often. My father always scolded me after we visited his family for being so quiet and acting uncomfortable around them. I spent a lot of time in the house. My father never liked that. He always wanted me to go outside and play with the other kids in the neighborhood, but I never wanted to out of fear. He would always give me a hard time for always being alone and not having friends. He would say, “You’re always alone, you have no friends.” I know I don’t have any friends and I’m always alone. It was very hurtful to listen to him and hear that, but he’s right. The truth hurts. He still says it to this day. I would talk to people in school, but I would never hang out with them outside of school. I couldn’t take that next step. And people never wanted to hang out with me anyway. They would never ask me if I wanted to hang out with them. They never asked for my phone number. I could never open up to people. I was always awkward and uncomfortable with other students in school. They definitely picked up on that. I went to the same school district since third grade, and I don’t have a single friend from there. My anxiety hit rock bottom out of nowhere during my freshman year of high school. It could be attributed to the fact I was going through puberty and my hormones were raging or it just progressively got worse. I started developing so many issues that were not a problem prior. I started having a hard time making eye contact with people. Being sensitive to how people look at me. If I get dirty looks from someone or a weird look, I feel like something is wrong with me and I’m devastated. When I’m out for a walk and someone is approaching me I either put my face down and look at the ground to avoid eye contact or I try to make the effort to make eye contact with the passerby, but they just look at me funny and I feel awkward. Going out for car rides and feeling like people in other cars are looking at me and judging me. Going out for walks with other people around. People noticing that I’m nervous or uncomfortable and judging me for it. Walking into a room full of people with all eyes on me. Always feeling like people are staring at me and judging me. Just so many issues that became so severe. I always had anxiety, but during my freshman year of high school my anxiety got much worse. Prior to this, my anxiety wasn’t that bad. I was more care-free. It was easier for me to interact with people. I was able to enjoy life more. The issues I started developing weren’t much of an issue in the past. I became so upset that my anxiety gotten worse. I let my mind convince myself that I’m never going to get better. I’m doomed to have social anxiety for the rest of my life. I’m never going to be able to go back to how I was before my freshman year of high school. Going out period around other people became too anxiety inducing for me, so I became a shut-in. I went through the rest of high school with debilitating anxiety. During sophomore year, I started eating lunch in the counseling office because eating in the cafeteria with all the other students became too overwhelming for me. I always walked with a book in my hand for a comfort. I was and still am very self-conscious of the way I walk. People say I walk very stiff or like a robot. Going to school everyday made me extremely nervous. Sitting in the classroom amongst other students and feeling like everyone is staring at me. Walking the hallways. Giving presentations. High school was hell. However I made it through and I graduated. I started college and I didn’t have the college experience. I struggled with anxiety. I just stayed in my dorm all day and did nothing. I didn’t make any friends, join any clubs/organizations, party, etc. I was too afraid to open up. I was too afraid to step outside of my comfort zone and make friends and just have fun. People would try to be my friend, but I was never comfortable. Everyone around me was having the time of their lives, making friends, etc. It was depressing because I wasn’t having any of that. I don’t even want to go back to school next year. I have no life. I just sit in the house all day everyday. I don’t work because I’m too afraid to get a job. How am I going to get through the interview? What if my coworkers won’t like me? What if my manager won’t like me? What if customers or my coworkers think I’m weird because I’m socially awkward? I try to get out of the house, but being out just makes me nervous. I want to have friends and I want to have a life. I feel like I have so much to offer, I just need to get past this awful fear. I go on social media and look at people I went to school with. They are having the time of their lives while I sit on my behind and do nothing. It’s upsetting. I have no personality. I feel like a robot. Everytime I interact with people in public I’m very stiff and robotic. People tell me I’m extremely nice, but honestly I feel like I have no personality. I can’t open up to people. I’m never comfortable and I’m always on edge. I’m living in fear. I just feel like I’m doomed to have social anxiety for the rest of my life. It has gotten so severe to the point where I don’t think I can ever recover. Sorry for the long post, but I needed to pour my feelings out. I’m sick of people telling me I’m just a lazy bum. People don’t know that I’m suffering with debilitating anxiety that’s affecting my life. Any advice will be appreciated.\", ' Just a rant. [I’m not sure if this is where I can post this; I just need to get some stuff off my chest.] So I wish I didn’t give a frack. I wish that I could do whatever I wanted without feeling that crushing wave of social anxiety wash over me, that I could fracking stand in line at the supermarket without having an inner freak out that people are judging me on the type of drink that I got or that I look weird because I was too lazy to pick shoes that matched my cloths. I’m sick and tired of it, literally, this anxiety is physically and mentally exhausting. I wish it wasn’t a struggle to just get up in the morning, that just a simple fracking hello leaves me with hours of unease and regret that I did it wrong. Yeah, yeah, call me crazy, call me irrational, but frick, it’s real and I’ve dealt with it almost every day since I can remember. People tell me that I shouldn’t just say “I wish this” and “I wish that” and that I should just get over it or do something about it. One, frack you guys who say “just get over it”, you’ve probably never dealt with anxiety, it’s like you are carrying the weight of everyone’s judgements and eyes on you with every possibility of any and every event running through your head all the time. It’s traumatic and we live with it everyday and in the end some of us can’t take it any longer, we can’t stand the pressure of living under the umbrella of our own minds. Two, you think I’m not dealing with it? I’ve done therapy, I’ve had over half a dozen different therapists and psychologists, I’ve done the meds and meditation and I still spent over half my junior year of high school locked in my bedroom crying and trying not to end it while my mother thought I just had mono and was “tired”. I am trying, I force myself outside and to interact but it’s terrifying and people just don’t seem to get that. When you’ve lived your whole life with these voices in your head telling you that you’re useless, you’re worthless, that no one likes you or that you’ll mess everything up, it’s hard to just shut it out. They echo all the time; you want to go out for ice cream, they’ll tell you people will think your ice cream choice is weird or you’ll drop the cone all over you or on someone else. Rinse wash and repeat with any and every social situation. Yeah I’m getting better, I’m moving forward. I haven’t ended it, but frack man, it just takes one bad look, one simple “freak” or “weirdo” uttered under someone’s breath that sends me spiraling right back down to that dark place. So yeah, I wish I could just not give a frack about what people think or say but I can’t. I’m still a work in progress and at the moment that’s all I have to give. ', 'Please Read. Hello r/socialanxiety, I am reaching out to you to maybe get some tips about how to get out of this deep hole of social anxiety, depression, frustration and self-hatred I\\'ve been in for the last few years, because the last weeks I\\'ve been getting progressively more hopeless and even suicidal. I am currently 18 years old and hate just about everything about me. I had to drop out of school at age 15 because of my social anxiety and daily panic attacks. I stopped going outside completly. I got rid of all my friends, I haven\\'t seen a friend in about 2-3 years now. I have been sent to involuntarily inpatient a few times, ran away from there a few times. Eventually the relationship with my mum got really bad and she \"kicked me out\" into my own small apartment. She practically disowned me, she doesn\\'t believe in mental illness and thinks I\\'m just being lazy. She just leaves groceries and water in front of my door once a week so I don\\'t starve, because I absolutly would prefer that to going outside. I haven\\'t left my apartment in months now. When I even think about going outside, I get panic attacks and can\\'t breathe. I think a lot of my self-hatred comes from my obesity. I don\\'t think I can even change anymore. My apartment is a mess, because I barely have the energy to get out of bed. I sleep all day or play games on the computer. I need medical attention, because I have an infection too, which could kill me any day, but I just can\\'t see anyone without passing out from anxiety. I currently think about killing myself and self-harm daily. I truly hate myself and am so hopeless. Someone got tips? :(', 'My (17F) anxiety is ruining me. I’ve posted here once before so I’ll reiterate some of the things I’ve mentioned. I was severely bullied through my late elementary school-early middle school years. Developed depression, anxiety, eating issues, and general body dysmorphia. All of these issues I still struggle with today. However, the most severe out of them is my anxiety. I worry over everything; no matter how big or small. The most insignificant thing can send me off in a fit of nerves and panic. I’m plagued with what ifs constantly. I’ve avoided social events because of anxiety. Most of my daily life is fucked up due to anxiety. My anxiety stems from the root of being afraid of messing up. As a kid, I taught myself to be a perfectionist; if I did everything perfectly I wouldn’t get in trouble. If I did everything right and was perfect inside and out, then my parents and friends and family wouldn’t have to worry about me. This has had a disastrous effect. I can’t go outside due to being so nervous of fucking up, doing something stupid, looking dumb, etc. I’ll get this knot in my stomach just thinking about going out with friends. I can’t talk to new/ somewhat familiar people because I get nervous that I’m not talking right or looking stupid or saying the wrong thing or just being overall disinteresting. Anything outside of my daily routine of work/school/home fucks me up. This also relates to new experiences. I’m scared of dating. I’m scared of sex. Whenever I think about these things I get this extreme burning sensation, a heavy fit of nerves, and I have to calm myself down because it gets so intense. I hate going on vacations because I get the what if’s and at the end of the day I just count down to the day I can be back in the safety of my own home. It’s killing me. I hate myself at the fact I can’t do regular things. I don’t have fun. My life is so mundane and basic that it frustrates me, but the anxiety and fear of the outside is what keeps me isolated. I can’t go places. I can’t talk to people. I can’t make new friends. I can’t live my life. I can’t take it anymore. It’s not even the fact that I won’t do it, I physically cannot do it. And it’s not like I can just shove myself out there. I’ve done that before and it’s just made everything worse. I’ve tried going out with a close friend and I hated it so much I just wanted to go home. I thought about trying to go out with a friend and his friends but I feel like I’ll just fuck up and make a mockery of myself. I don’t know what to do.', 'Is this early social anxiety?. 16M, suffer from GAD (Generalised Anxiety Disorder) since a very young age, this was seen by my many phobias. Im introverted, shy, quiet, INTP (according to the MBTI). In the last few months I have been noticing changes in my behaviour around other people. Ive started to avoid social interactions, I still have friends, a small group of people in my school and in my local band, I talk to them with no problems. I avoid going to the supermarket and other places because I fear I can find someone that I know and I have to talk to them and greet them, this makes me somewhat uncomfortable. I get a little bit nervous when making phone calls. In a conversation I start shaking amd sweating when Im talking about something that I know a lot of. I avoid being around many people like going to the beach, cafes, bars, restaurants and others. When in those places I am always looking at other people because I think they are staring at me and laughing at me for whatever reason. I hate being in the spotlight, this has made me avoid getting into a romantitc relashionship (my family would be all over me asking me uncomfortable questions), has made me avoid social interactions with other people because I fear I will be judged by them for whatever reason. *Note*: I dont have much anxiety in these situations, they just make me uncomfortable, the worst was me shaking my hands a bit and sweating, a increased heart beat but nothing over the top. Are these the early signs of social anxiety?', \"My SA is slowly ruining my life. I'm 19, I'm supposed to be a normal guy who is able to enjoy social life, it's never the case for me, I'm not sure where it all went wrong and I find it hard to not blame my parents and the way they raised me, especially that the last therapist I went to is so shitty he encouraged me to blame my parents and friends for my mental problems. Anyways, I have insane social anxiety, I mean unbelievably insane and it doesn't seem to be fixing itself anytime soon, this was the case since I became a teenager, I'm talking at least 5 years of being an insecure guy. When outside I assume everyone is looking at me all the time and judging me on EVERY step I make, and if you were looking at me I sure look like it, it affects my outside image even if I do my best to pretend to be confident. Also my literal self image becomes so weird in my mind and too focused on my insecurities that I feel like I'm a walking goblin when outside. When I look at myself in the mirror afterwards I think it's not as bad as I thought, and this happened countless times it's insane, now it's everytime I go to the university. On top of all this I find it so hard to make friends, and this only happened when I started uni, I'm obviously an introvert but on top of that I always isolate myself, I don't like going to someone and starting a conversation because I always assume they would think like me and hate someone else doing that to them, that maybe I would bother them. Not to mention girls that I find so hard to start and maintain a conversation with, and when one does I pretend I don't care (while getting an anxiety attack), yet I get attached so easily for the stupidest things, getting rejected twice certainly didn't help, but I only blame myself because I handle situations like those so badly. Sorry for rambling too much but I had to, this is affecting my life and it will be ruined if I don't fix it. I have nowhere to turn but the internet right now.\", \"Severe anxiety. I need help figuring out how to work from home. Please.. Let me give you a rundown of my life right now. I'm 25 and I live with my mom. I dropped out of high school when I was 16 and I haven't gone outside since then. I've spent the last 9 years of my life locked away in this apartment with my mom, mostly by myself in my own bedroom. The only other family that visits is my dad who comes for 1 hour every month. No other family. No friends at all. All because of how significant my anxiety is. I can't handle going outside. I've searched for help for so long. I've sought help from others online, from self help videos and books to personally researching mental illnesses and finding strategies to combat it, but nothing has helped. It continues to grow worse and worse. I've never been to a doctor, so I've never been diagnosed, but I suspect I probably have other kinds of mental illnesses as well as my anxiety, and I'm also having pretty bad health issues that are growing worse and worse. I'm significantly underweight as a male at only 117lbs and 6 ft tall. I have some kind of skin inflammation issue that has been getting worse and spreading all over my body that started in my late teens. Sleeping issues. Joint pain issues. Memory issues. Issues focusing. Issues learning and enjoying things. Anger issues. Incapability of maintaining online friendships. Social issues. The list goes on and on. I'm just really sick. Both mentally and physically. Really, what I want to do is see a therapist. An online one. I've tried everything I can on my own, but maybe talking with a therapist online could help me with my anxiety at least to a point where I can get myself outside to go to a doctor and a therapist in person. The problem is I don't have any money, and since I don't have financial support for something like online therapy, I need help figuring out how I could make money to pay for therapy. I'm basically just so stuck with this. I have literally no skills and don't even know where to begin. I've tried applying for various transcription jobs but I keep getting declined. I've tried looking up online jobs for someone with no qualifications like me and I couldn't find anything at all. I have no useful skills at all. I've wasted my entire life playing video games, and I'm not really even good at them. What I really need right now is some help, developing some kind of skill that I could use to make money. But the thought is so overwhelming to me, because I've tried for my entire life to learn various hobbies, but I really have issues with little to no interest in things, issues focusing, issues learning and memorizing and improving at things have just made it so difficult. I don't know if there's out there who is willing to teach me or help me find some kind of way that I can work online to make some money, but if there is please message me because I could really use some help right now and I don't really have anyone else in life to turn to.\", \"Giving up driving. There are a couple of things that trigger my anxiety. People rarely get mad at me but when it happens (even when unjustified) it saddens me and entirely ruins my day. Also, i'm living in my parent's home for 20 years and although i know very few neighbors i feel stalked outside, and it's like everyone knows who i am (the building complex is in a dead-end street and all the windows make me anxious). I took my license 3 months ago and i usually drive as safely as i can. My problem comes from some drivers. The other day i was honked at while stopping at the stop sign. Today i was leaving school's parking lot when i gave way to 2 other students - one looked at me in complete disgust while passing by, the other laughed at me (i even considered if i made some mistake). An hour later i parked in my street and went home. I occasionally heard some honks outside and it made me realize i was missing something. I found someone pulling my windshield wipers up. So i parked a bit more inclined to the road side than to the sidewalk (these are small streets and people usually park in the sidewalk) and other car couldn't pass to the end of the street. I could barely handle the looks while closing the wipers and parking again. This is probably the stupidest reason to stop driving but i can't picture myself inside that car ever again. I've made some other minor mistakes but my impression of being stalked has risen even more. Most people in my country are not rude but the looks i get while walking outside are somewhat the opposite to the anger i feel from some drivers. The truth is that i can't deal with mistakes that require to be solved socially and i found it through a terribly expensive experience.\", 'Advice on getting a job?. I’m 17, currently homeless but staying with my grandma. My social anxiety has got a lot worse as there’s been a lot of recent trauma and I can’t even go outside anymore, a social worker cane to visit and agreed that she’d help me get counselling at home, I’m hoping soon I’ll start getting better. As I’m not in education, I need to start earning money but I find it impossible to even go outside. I was wondering if anybody here can give me some ideas of what temporary at home job I could look for? I’m in the UK if that’s any help, I know these jobs are hard to come by so realistically I’m not expecting some miracle. I would actually love to start my own business but I just can’t think at the moment. I’d like to know what jobs do people here have? Also, does anybody have any general advice for me that could help my situation right now? I don’t have anybody to talk to, nobody to support me. I feel really embarrassed posting on here but hopefully it’s for the greater good :/ ?', \" Medication might be the answer. I recently got on a medication that helps with depression and anxiety, and let me tell you, it has made a huge difference. Of course it didn't completely cure me but it made being around people bearable. Before I got on medication I would wake up with dread knowing I have to go outside and interact with people. Once I got work/school I could feel a knot building up in my throat, my body would get tense, my chest would feel tight, and my breathing became short. I felt like everyone's eyes were on me. The paranoia would creep in, and I literally felt like running. I was isolating myself and never wanted to leave my house which caused me to fall into a bad depression. Now that I'm on medication those symptoms have gone away. I am a shy person, so I still get little nervous when talking to new people. I feel like I can think more clearly when I'm around people and I feel a lot more relaxed. I've come to terms that I'm not gonna be that social butterfly that everyone likes and I'm working on just being myself. There's still some issues I want to work out with a therapist such as my low self-esteem and low-confidence. I feel like I sound like a commercial, but please consider medication if your social anxiety is affecting your life. Also seek help from a therapist. I know it's scary, I've been there, social anxiety kept me from seeing a doctor. But I got tired of being scared of people. \", \"Feel like I am in a straightjacket in public.

Am about to stand up from sitting on the grass with different groups of people around and over thinking how to stand up? I overthink the smallest things in public like my movements etc to the point where I feel like I am in a straight jacket? I have an extremely strong internal critic Does anyone know anything to help with this?\", 'Social Anxiety: Road to Recovery. Social anxiety is an awful mental health disorder. Having suffered from it since I was 15, I understand how debilitating it can be to just go outside and how the fear before just doing the simplest of tasks can make you feel. I am making this post because, although I know this subreddit tends to be mainly memes and jokes, and I love it for that, we do all share one common thing - we all suffer/do suffer from social anxiety. And for many, this post will be useless, but when I first subscribed to this subreddit, I’d never done anything significant to truly address and deal with my mental health. I had a feeling of hopelessness that I no longer have, and if I could go back in time and give these words to myself, I would. If this post can help just one person, then I’ll be happy! But right, in the last year, I met a girl. I struggle with going to University, but I need a future. She made me NEED to get better, and I wish I had the self control to make MYSELF force myself to take steps in getting better. I know for a fact there is someone reading this who hasn’t taken these steps to try and improve their social anxiety, because the social anxiety itself prevents people from doing so. Getting help involves speaking to say, a doctor, or a therapist, and this can be a massive, scary deal. So, with having social anxiety, it can be tremendously difficult to take the first steps to recovery. This is unique, in that suffering from a mental disorder such as OCD or depression doesn’t necessarily restrict you seeking help in the sense of being unable to get yourself, on your own, to see a doctor or a therapist. However, you have to want to get better. You have to know that you deserve better, that social anxiety is NOT normal, is NOT something anyone should suffer with, and that it IS a strongly researched mental health disorder which is legitimate and known by every health professional. You need to enforce this desire, and you have to make a doctors appointment. This will create a dialogue with your GP. You have to see what support is there for you. Your GP speaks to hundreds of people every week, with a whole host of different issues, both physical and mental. Mental health is a massive public health issue and is finally being treated as such. SEE. YOUR. DOCTOR! Doing this was the best thing I ever did, even though I was terrified when I had my first appointment. I am not ashamed to admit that I had some alcohol before going, thought about cancelling in the week leading up to the appointment and was just downright terrified of going. But I did, I said that I had anxiety, in social situations, and guess what - he understood. Doctors. Don’t. Judge. I was put on a small dose of medication - was a bit weird for the first few days, as it made me lose my appetite and feel a bit weird, but it settled. You don’t notice the affects of anxiety medication too much, it takes about 6 weeks for it to have any affect. It’s likely you’ll also have your dose increased after your body settles on it. It can feel like a long process, you just want to stop having these feelings of anxiety, of dread, of fear going somewhere and having the physical symptoms of your anxiety presenting themselves and embarrassing you. But it’s just the first step to getting better - medication CAN work. Some say it doesn’t work for them, but it definitely makes some difference for some, and I am living proof of that. Next - therapy. I wouldn’t have been able to do a single therapy session if it weren’t for medication. Some will be able to, and if you are, great. Secondly, money. I live in the UK, and here the NHS offer therapy for free if the patient needs it, so I’m lucky in that sense, although the waiting list was 3 months. I am aware that in many countries, therapy isn’t cheap. However, even where money is tight, please realise that your mental state is so important, and is ABSOLUTELY worth spending money on in looking to improve it. Social anxiety is not normal, and is not something you should have to be subject to every day. You deserve to get professional help. For those who literally cannot afford therapy, I sincerely apologise and ask you to see if there is anything you can do to get the help you need. Therapy is scary, at first. But it’s also the best thing I’ve forced myself to do. You become familiar and comfortable with a therapist. They understand social anxiety, they put you at ease and remind you that this is their JOB, and that they deal with patients with social anxiety EVERY SINGLE DAY. These are things you can do, that WILL make an improvement to your social anxiety. It will make your quality of life better, and it is absolutely worth doing. You only get one life on this earth, don’t live yours in the shackles of social anxiety because you deserve better. Support is out there!', \"I can't make friends for the life of me.

I feel like this is the right place to share this, and probably sounds all too familiar to most of you, at least some of it may. I\\'ll start by listing the things my social anxiety has stopped me from doing, from most severe (what I really wish I could do) to not so severe (it\\'s annoying but I don\\'t dwell on it): 1. Messaging people first 2. Exercising 3. Wearing short clothing in public 4. Meeting potential partners 5. Needing alcohol to speak to people I don\\'t know too well 6. Going out at night The most horrifying thing that I deal with is never messaging friends first, since I am always under the impression that I\\'m bothering them, and that they don\\'t want to speak to me. I\\'m always \"alert\" for subtle cues that they make in order to confirm my suspicions. A friend of mine never responds anyway so I\\'ve stopped trying, even though I would love to keep up the friendship. My old friends from high school never messaged me first so I convinced myself that I upset them, so we eventually lost touch. In my defence, any time I do message first, they rarely respond and if I try to make plans, they never accept. I found out recently that they made plans without me which definitely hurt. I suppose I\\'m looking for a fresh perspective on the situation. I don\\'t exercise. At all. My local park is always full of people so I don\\'t go there, and the gym is always full and leads into my next issue (short clothing). I don\\'t like the way I run - I imagine myself to be like Phoebe from Friends. I can\\'t wear short clothing in public. Shorts, T-Shirts what have you. I feel the need to cover every part of me that I can. Doesn\\'t matter if it\\'s 100° out, I\\'ll still be wearing a sweatshirt and jeans. I\\'m 21 and have been single my entire life because I\\'m absolutely terrified of rejection from others. I\\'ve never asked a girl out, or even spoken to one in more than a platonic manner. The last two aren\\'t such an issue, though as I say, they\\'re annoying. The thing is, I\\'ve got a degree in Psychology, and know that the best way to do it is through exposure, but even the thought of it sends my heart racing.

Hi, I’m 13 male and i like to play street basketball with friends, play soccer and play basketball on my school team. So anyways i have something that is still really bothering me that happened 2 days ago. I was hanging out with my friend after school and his name is Dylan. We were wanting to get a street basketball game going so we called a bunch of guys and planned on playing in a hour. We had 8 guys interested. My brother was also interested and wanted to play so we said he could play. Then my mom said little later. I have a doctor appointment booked for you in 30 minutes and you have to go before you can play with your friends. She suggested all 4 of us (me, my bro, dylan) drive together to my doctor appointment and then she would drive us to the game. I said ok and quickly ran upstairs to my bedroom and put on my basketball jersey with shorts on. Then i said i’m ready to go. So we all drove to the doctors. Once we were there we didn’t have to wait long because it was booked already and the nurse comes to the waiting room and calls my name. I get up and saw my bro and dylan still sitting. I told them they could come too if they want. My mom then said are you sure because your your going to get a physical exam done. I didn’t know what that was and thought it meant was going to be showing how physical fast and strong i am. So they know im not weak for my age. So i told them yeah i don’t mind them coming in. So we got in the doctors room and we are waiting for 5 minutes and the doctor walks in. He says hi to me and my mom and then notices my friend and brother sitting in the room too. He then said are you sure you want your brother or friend in here when we do your physical exam? I said i don’t mind. Still not know what that really means. The doctor then said ok can you sit on the bed and take off your jersey? so checked my heartbeat and measured my waist. Then said ok can you remove your shorts. I was wondering why he was telling me to do this and was little embarrassed taking my shorts off in front of my brother and friend because both of them have never saw my in my underwear before or naked. Besides when i was 5 years old having a bath with my brother was the last time. So i take off my shorts and he told me to lay on the bed. So i did and pushing my tummy and using this triangle thing on my knee that makes my knee jump. He then told me he needs to check my bowels so told me to lay on my side facing away from everyone. He then lowers my underwear and my butt is now showing to everyone and i was so embarrassed! i could hear my bro and dylan giggling a bit. So then the doctor uncomfortably puts his finger in me and kinda hurt and then it was done and got me to stand up. I felt really embarrassed already and noticed my friend holding his phone and smiling. He had his phone down so i don’t know if he took a video or picture of me. Then the doctor said Can you please remove your underwear?! I was so nervous and felt anxiety coming in and looked at my bro and dylan who looked really excited. So i took off my underwear and covered myself and the doctor said put your hands on your sides. I could hear my bro and friend giggling but didn’t want to look at them. The doctor then checked everything including my frontal area for 5 minutes and also told me to turn around. Once everything was done and we left the doctors i felt so embarrassed! I didn’t want to talk to anyone. It was nobody’s fault but mine because my mom and the doctor both warned me and i didn’t know what a physical exam is. I can’t blame them. So my mom dropped us off at the basketball game but i really didn’t want to play cause i was having social anxiety and i sat off to the side. My bro and friend i noticed were talking to some guys and looked at me. I don’t know if they took a picture of me or video something but i felt embarrassed.

I mean, I do study, I do talk to my family and I do occasionally have good days and every once in a while, that being maybe 3 times total every year, I go to a party and get along well enough that I don't feel completely lost, but generally speaking I have maybe 10% of what an average human being needs to feel content and have a good self esteem. I'm just too debilitated from this to feel good about myself and I'm also constantly met with other people who dismiss me because I'm not good enough to be their aquintance and even my teachers ever since I was a kid all give me that look as if they've seen something for the first time they don't understand like there's something written on my face that I'm not aware of. I'm just frustrated with my life entirely. I feel like I *can* eventually make something of myself, but I just never fucking do anything and I feel completely stuck and debilitated.\", \" I do have something. I've always wanted to be a singer.  and before I knew I wanted to be a singer, when I was young, I was constantly finding time to be by myself so I could listen to music  and sing. So it was obvious that I was going to want to be a singer. Its the only think that has kept me alive. Also like you I love running, but simply can't stand the fear of passing by somebody on the same side of the road or people waving. Makes me so so uncomfortable. As to the nobody stays depressed thing. Sure you could say that, but not everyone can handle being depressed so long. I truly don't care about the reaction of others if I commit suicide. I need to worry about whats good for me, I need to learn to be more selfish. Not close to my family at all. The only one I'd worry about is my one year old little cat. \", \" Me too. Running is so much fun but I can't get over the idea of someone looking at me and judging me for running weird or not being very athletic or even just because I'm running.

Even when I'm about to miss a train, I stop running if someone can see me, lol. \", \" Yes I've actually already posted about this a couple times in the past. Though I was more so bringing it up because for awhile in the summer I was running in the early mornings but stopped because I was very socially anxious about how fast I was running.

When I’m at work, I can click into this character, and this character is basically composed of all the qualities I want to be all the time. I can lead meetings, control a conversation, and just ooze charisma. But at the end of the 8 hours, I go home and reflect on every slight social mess up I’ve had during the day. Every time I stuttered or wasn’t ready for a question or didn’t have a witty response to a comment or told a joke that fell flat. I just sit and reflect, reliving those moments over and over, imagining what my professional character would do differently to handle that situation better. And make new scripts and lines for those responses. When I’m not at work I am almost like a different person, I can’t talk to any stranger. Gyms terrify me. Throwing a frisbee in front of someone I don’t know is horrifying. I can’t ride a bike in public without feeling like everyone’s staring at me. I dare not inconvenience anyone. I seldom do anything alone so I can blend in better, but the thing is, I love doing things with people and meeting them, but I just can’t meet them as me until like 3 years down the line before I take done the persona.

I was doing therapy before the lockdown but due to it I haven’t been going at all. This while also making no money and not really having any friends to hang out with has caused me to fend for myself.

Turns out there as whole film community on there and some even invited me to a group chat and now we all talk about movies. We even have Netflix watch parties where we can talk and watch a movie and even have movie trivia nights with this guy who goes live like twice a week. This has given me something to do and even boasted my confidence as I get new followers and meet some new people. I would recommend finding a hobby and trying to improve on it and maybe even starting something like this where you put yourself out there and see what happens. I know this could be difficult and may even sound stupid but it helped a lot. I’ve also signed up for a summer course, idk if that’s open for you. But it also gave me something to do.

My social anxiety is very crippling, but I realize I need money to make my life better in the long run (i.e college funds, rent, etc). So here are some personal tips: nn1. Volunteer. Local pet shelters are great for this as they accept everyone who is willing and not a crazy psycho trying to skin cats. This will introduce you to the social environment of work, and if you volunteer at a pet shelter you will have animals to calm you during the stressful moments. Plus you can literally decide to go whenever you want. For me I go once a week for an hour or two and I even lead shifts now. It helps.nn2. Apply for quiet places. Like a fabrics store or garden center. Something very mello will help your anxiety. My first job was at Walmart in the produce section. The worst you\\'ll have to deal with is someone asking you where the oranges are while standing in front of them. You don\\'t have to work at McDonald\\'s boo, you can be a recluse and water plants for 6 hours a day.nn3. You have phone anxiety like me, so don\\'t pick up! Let them leave a voicemail. I got so many calls when applying for my first jobs and never once answered the first time. They would leave a voicemail and I would promptly call back within 2 hours to a day and give some believable excuse as to why I couldn\\'t answer such as I was in school, on the road, personal issue, bad cell service, etc. They\\'d always be happy to hear back and I would schedule interviews that way. Once you have an interview, save their number and wait for a call back and pick up if you can that time.nn4. Practice practice practice! Write down possible questions and answers to them. Go over them outloud. Take phone calls in a quiet or calm place. Practice common interview questions and prepare to be nervous.nn5. Set your hours low at first and work later or in the mornings. Go for about 18 to 20 a week and work from there. Do NOT, I REPEAT, DON\\'T set hours you\\'ll hate out of desperation that they will only want you if your availability is from 8am to 10pm Monday to Sunday. Also, pick late or early shifts. I.e pick shifts after people go to work for the day to before they get off (9am to 3pm) or after they are usually at home or asleep (9pm to early am for me personally). This is a great time to work at a store like Walmart, Target, etc. The most customers you\\'ll face are nurses or old women who are looking for plants in the meat asile. Get to know your city\\'s schedule and schedule yourself for times when the mass of people are typically busy or elsewhere. 24 hour stores are usually in need of people for these shifts.nn6. Finally, tell them you have anxiety. I have had two jobs, but have been offered over five and have applied to about 15 places. All of which, if I was interviewed, I explained my social anxiety. Employers nowadays are a bit more sensitive to this. You can say \"I have very bad social anxiety, and would prefer doing things mostly in the back or away from people until I am used to the work environment to prevent any problems from arising.\" They\\'ll usually say \"well we will train you to do x thing, but if it takes some time we\\'ll work with you.\" That\\'s when you know they\\'re interested. Don\\'t hide your anxiety to someone who can affect your future employability. My current boss and assistant manager both know how bad I suffer and often coddle me when they see it affecting my work performance. My fellow employees, though I am not friends with them, also understand this and will help me. I work in a pizza place and I take orders on register, give out food, and answer phones. When I need to step away I ask someone to take over and they will. Getting overwhelmed isn\\'t bad, just take a second to step back.nnSome other general tips to remember: Always apply for jobs you\\'ll like FIRST, wait a few days, and then apply for jobs you can deal with theoretically. Try to really go for jobs that match your interests as it\\'ll be easier to adjust to.nnIf you get denied, don\\'t freak. I did this before and it does nothing but take away all your hard work. An interview will happen again.nnI hope I helped.', \"I get my camera and take pictures of the sunset through my window instead of going outside for a better shot..

Honestly, no thinking about what to say, no thinking at all. It helps to sit in a chair, close your eyes and focus on your breathing so that it can slow down.

It's a form of mindfulness.nnDo this for some time, let's say 15 minutes. Do your make up then, get out of that hotel room and take your notes with you! Go for a walk, try to focus on your senses (the smells, the sounds, the winds and the temperature, possible the sun burning your skin). nnMaybe read your notes slightly while you walk? It offers you a chance to still read it but focus your attention on something else at the same time. I hope this helps. Good luck!

If you have I recommend you go cold turkey on it until graduation so that you can focus on preparing for the future as well as engaging in activities that will reduce your anxiety.nnThen I recommend that you try to spend at least half an hour each day (you can even use a timer) which you dedicate to deciding what you want to do for the future. Ask yourself what your dream job would be. Then do research about what you should be doing to to get closer to having that job. If having a university education improves your chances of fulfilling your dreams, then go for university. Once you have figured whether you want to study or immediately start working, it's time to take the necessary steps to achieve your goal. Research universities you want to apply for, research employers you want to work for. Then rank them according to how attractive they seem, this will significantly reduce anxiety, as even if you don't get your first option you will likely have dozens of good alternatives on your list. You said your grades were good, so someone is very likely to accept you. nnThen try to figure out what each institution/workplace requires from you. Start writing your CV, your letter of motivation or whatever else they might need. You still have until summer before you graduate, and if you spend half an hour per day on these things the time will add up.nnRegarding your social anxiety there are many techniques you can use to reduce or remove it completely, but it does require some work. A good first step is always to ask yourself what gives you the most anxiety. Is it public speaking? Is it conversations? Based on your story it sounds like you have anxiety about meeting new people (a fear I know all too well). The best solution to this is, of course, to keep meeting new people. Find out about social activities you can do in your town or neighbourhood is there a sports-club, movie-club, hiking group, debating society? Another advice is to build a social anxiety ladder, where you will rank your anxieties from least to most anxiety provoking. Then work yourself up this list. Start by exposing yourself to situation that only makes your slightly anxious, once you feel that you can handle these more easily, start on the next item on the list.nnAlso, I need to add that just because you feel anxious around the people in your class doesn't mean that you will feel anxious around other people in the future. You said it was fine before you started gymnasium, so it is not unlikely that some anxiety are caused by the type of people you hang out with. Personally I don't interact with most people from my course unless I have to. Most of my friends are from other courses, or from outside of university altogether. Everyone has certain types of people that they feel more comfortable around, eventually you will find your type :)nnGood luck!

I (23 years old) have some old college friends I still see about every week. For various reasons, a few of those friends, have grown closer to each other, and they are closer to each other than they are to me, although we still go out for drinks, bbq, have movie nights, and have fun every week, or every other week. Their social networks are also much broader than mine, because their careers all require extensive networking. I have also made different groups of friends since college, but not to the same degree as them. I know I feature less prominently in their lives than they do in mine at this point, and it’s not personal. We still have a good time, and just because things change doesn’t invalidate the friendship we do still enjoy. And when it comes to planning any kind of party, they are definitely my favorite friends to go out for a crazy night or a drink with. All of this is fine, until it comes to my birthday. My birthday falls on Labor Day weekend. Last year most of my college friends took advantage of Labor Day weekend to go on a trip to a cabin and have fun together. The person coordinating the event (whose parents own the cabin) obviously chose who would go (only a limited number of people were allowed to come with his parents’ permission). While this same person is a friend of mine, I was not a close enough friend to make the cut to be invited on the trip. Those invited on the trip, however, included most of my friends from college. This forced me to push my birthday party to a different weekend, as I still wanted my old college friends at my birthday party (I didn’t have as many other friends yet that year). But it really made me feel pathetic to plan my birthday around people who had decided I was not important enough to include on a trip the same weekend as my birthday. From what I understand, this same group is going on a trip this Labor Day weekend—once again on my birthday. Obviously a lot of people travel on the 3 day weekend, and I’m not a narcissist who expects no one to travel just cause it’s my birthday. I am also mature enough to not be overly offended if some of my friends plan trips without including me sometimes. But it really hurts me that my college friends all have a yearly tradition to go on a trip I’m not invited on every year the same weekend as my birthday. I know we all are going our separate ways, and I know I am making too much of a deal of my birthday, but birthdays are miserable reminders of life passing by for most people after a certain age, so I feel extra vulnerable around mine, and this is a bit of a punch to the gut for the past 2 years. I don’t want to be childish and tell them not to use the 3 day weekend (that would be dumb and selfish), I don’t want to force myself onto the trip (also dumb and childish), and I don’t want to cut out friendships over something that I don’t think is meant to be personal, when these friendships are mostly rewarding throughout the rest of the year. If someone could gently help me put this into perspective, or how to make me feel less in pain about this. However I celebrate on my birthday, I know I would feel the absence of those friends, and I don’t want to plan some elaborate trip in response—that’s just petty and wouldn’t actually help me stop being petty and hurt over this. I was also thinking about going on a backpacking trip alone so I can get some time to myself, because I don’t like how my relationships with other people are affecting my sense of self worth. That’s not how I want to live my life, and maybe I need to become more independent, and I am tired of having all this stress and pageantry around my birthday. I just know that I will likely be feeling bad because of this on my birthday (I know this is immature, and I need to work past this), and I’m afraid this will be in my thoughts no matter what I do. Please be nice. I know I am being needy and vulnerable. I want to be better than this so I don’t keep beating myself up.', \"Well, I'm going to start finding some new hobbies.

This is my life story focused on how I struggled with SAD and what I did to overcome and cope with this horrible disorder. I hope that others that are suffering with Social Anxiety can not only relate, but can also see a path to success. It started in 4th or 5th grade or so and continued to get at its worst in 6th grade. In 6th grade, I would avoid social situations, I wouldn’t talk to most people around me and I was always known as the “quite kid”. I wouldn’t even talk to my own family.. I completely isolated myself from everyone except a couple of friends that I made in the previous years. But sometimes, I would isolate myself from them as well. I felt different, like everyone else was normal and I wasn’t. I did not understand how to talk to people, how to laugh, how to be around others without being judged. This was an all time low for me. So how did I go from an all time low in 6th grade to overcoming SAD? Well obviously this didn’t happen over night. Lets fast forward to freshman year in high school. At this point, I am not as bad as I was in 6th grade. I was able to make a few friends in middle school around 8th grade, but most of them did not go to my high school, only two of them. But despite having friends, I was still very quite. I kept to myself, constantly just on my phone. At lunch, I really didn’t have anybody to talk to most of the time. And every time somebody tried to talk to me, I just did not know how to communicate with them, I completely shutdown and I was just basically screaming in my head please just go away! So did I ever make any new friends? Not really. I avoided social situations, I kept to myself. Another reason why I did this, is because every time I got nervous taking to someone, my face would get really hot and I turn red very fast, this led me to avoid every single social interaction that I possibly could avoid because of the fear of blushing from how nervous I got. So that’s most of my struggles with this, I need to speed things up because this is turning into a book.. I got a job as a snowboard instructor (still freshman year in high school) and I had to teach groups of kids and sometimes adults how to snowboard. As someone who was very antisocial and a clear case of SAD, this was not easy. But while it was difficult at first, it actually wasn’t that hard. I didn’t need to make small talk with the kids, all I needed to do was to talk about snowboarding and show them how to do it. I had a step by step plan and I knew exactly what I was going to say. This was the first step for me to learn how to communicate with people like a normal human being. I did this for 4 years all through high school. This job helped significantly to force me to stop avoiding situations and to face my fear of social interactions and judgment The next step was college. The first class I took was a communications class, this forced me to speak in front of people every week. This class was proof that even though my speeches sucked, I could stand in front of people and not panic. I proved to my self that despite my SAD, I can do this. This class was truly the pinnacle of overcoming SAD. This class (Mindful Communication) tested how far I have come. I went from complete isolation from people and complete avoidance of all social situations, to standing in front of a college class of 25 people, which were all judging every word I said. I don’t think it’s this class that is what helped me so much.. but it was just the test to show that I can do this. What helped me so much was a combination of things. But I think the biggest help my was my experience as a snowboard instructor. It forced me to communicate with parents, kids, and other snowboard instructors. Putting yourself in the situation that you don’t want to be in is the best way to learn to cope with social anxiety. This is what worked for me, I’m not saying you all need to become snowboard instructors, but find something that will force you to communicate with people that you also enjoy doing. It’s not easy, but this is what it takes. So am I cured? No not completely. But I do not let social Anxiety run my life like it use to. I control my anxiety and I learned to cope with it. I do not avoid social situations like I use to, and I no not get super nervous when talking to people. I have a much better relationship with my family, and I now work as a software developer. I am 23 years old, and I have overcome SAD. I still have some social Anxiety, but it is not a disorder and it’s significantly improved. I hope my story is able to help somebody out there.

Thanks for reading', 'Have you ever been so high while with strangers that you perceive that the strangers know you’re too high and they’re just being nice with you but really they want to end the conversation?. I have just moved into a new neighbourhood and was walking my dog. I approached a house and there was a little party/get together going on. There was a group of people on the front lawn. Two people shouted from across the street fo comment on and compliment my dog. They were really friendly and they eventually asked if I wanted to walk over and have a beer. I said sure, and walked over. I met like 10 people at the party. They were all really nice and chill, asked about my dog, what I did for work. I had a beer. Someone offered me tequila, I had a couple shots. Then they asked if I wanted to come along into the backyard, everyone’s going inside. I go back in, I’m getting very anxious now and I’m trying to force myself to stay to have some friends in the neighbourhood. So I’m in the backyard with about 6 people. Someone offers me a spliff and I smoke a nice one. I haven’t had a day off work in two weeks so I wanted to have a good time. I start fo feel it, and I get self conscious that they’re thinking I’m acting weirdly. Eventually someone ordered pizza and everyone went inside one by one until it was just me and one person just talking now in the backyard gazebo. I’m fucking disgustingly high, licking my dry ass lips, petting my dog. Trying to keep up with the conversation. Someone else just arrived and they came up to me and the person i’ve been taking to for a while. They introduced themselves to me. They asked me if I wanted to come inside to have pizza, and if I wanted to bring my dog inside the house. They left it up to me. I felt that they could tell how fucking high I was, and that I wasn’t making sense and I was responding so long. I told them I was heading home and that it was nice to meet them. There were two guys in the background and I felt like they were talking about me. The person I was talking to knew I had a partner but they asked for my number. I was honestly so incoherent and I couldn’t keep up with conversation any more lol. Then the other friend said “oh not like that, just to keep in contact since you did did talk to him for 30 mins.” They offered to walk me home. I lived just up the street. I knew he had 3 kids, and I felt such anxiety thinking that he just knew I was so fucking high that he only asked for my number to make sure I was okay. I said “nah I’m good” and they said “yeah you’re a big girl”. I’m 25 and they looked like they were early to mid 30s. I look like I’m in high school though and a couple of them did ask me if I was old enough to drink. So I’m so self conscious that i think they think I’m just a fucking twat.

Later that day we went to this local fair, and me and this girl had been making eye contact pretty often, I thought nothing of it and went on with my day. Later on I saw her again, we made eye contact and I smiled. So suddenly she comes up to me and asks for my snap! Even better, my uncle tells me a girl came up to him and asked about me!

The positive with these apps is you can accept or reject deliveries and set your own house which you can’t do delivering for a pizza restaurant or Jimmy Johns, but of course the trade off is you generally make more money actually delivering for a restaurant.

Stay strong and keep fighting :) ', ' Social Anxiety: The Essentials. After looking around, I felt that sharing my story may help others. And in some way make all the pointless suffering mean something if it helps or resonates with one person. Preface: I am a 24-year-old college grad whos spent countless years languishing in deep thought/fear/pain about their own behaviors and emotions. Probably have had more internal conversations than external ones. Crushed at times under the carousel of depression/self-loathing. Other times crippled so badly by fears of judgments that basic human tasks become sources of complete life-threatening terror. This becomes further compounded when those \"loved ones\" around you gladly and publicly point out your fears as if exposing you will somehow make you stronger. All of this and more! As I share my failures, my victories, and continuous battle with social anxiety. &amp;#x200B; The best way to tell this story is perhaps through pain points of the past, present,(and even future). So I will just dive in no particular order. &amp;#x200B; The Phone Who knew a modern wonder of tech that is supposed to connect us could also be the source of such bone-numbing fear. I think it all started back in 1st grade. A girl gave me her phone number (remember I am like 7). After school I called, and we engaged in the most 7-year-old conversation ever. So basically a conversation about nothing. Afterward, I found out that my Mom and Brother had picked up the downstairs phone and listened to the whole thing. They then for weeks afterward mocked me and repeated what I said on the phone. Talk about traumas to an undefined child. It\\'s events such as those that drive you to form opinions about yourself and make an early association with fear and speaking on the phone. Fast forward and think of all the times (starting from age 7) you have had to speak on the phone. Now imagine each time the thought of using a phone is so horrible it turns your stomach over. Social anxiety in a nutshell. I\\'ve found that with time receiving a phone call was the easier evil. Somehow it being unexpected and someone else initiating the conversation took the edge off it. Having lived into adulthood, phone calls are inevitable so you eventually (through exposure) adapt and develop a tolerance for them. Yet even so to this day placing a phone call to someone is still sometimes a shaky voice and sweaty palm event, particularly when its phone interview. I have one coming up in a few days and dread the idea of literally taking a phone call to be judged by someone. And don\\'t even get me started on making or taking a call in a quiet office space. Advice: Slowly Expose yourself (naturally through time or forcibly by need) to phone interactions. Next time you order food try calling instead of making your mom do it/using an app. Make a doctor\\'s appointment. Usually calling places that handle constant phone calls ( docs/food/customer service) are the easiest to make because you know what you need to say and the person usually is going off a script. It\\'s scary (trust me), but you can work up to it. I avoided using the phone until it became ridiculous for my age and just faced it through trial and error. &amp;#x200B; The Checkout Experience For the LONGEST time growing up this was another point of contact for me and my social anxiety. Having to go alone to a counter and ask/buy something. I really honed my avoidance maneuvers. Giving money to friends to buy my ticket. Walking together up to the counter with someone and throwing my order on theirs so at least I wasn\\'t alone doing it. Or just flat out avoided buying things or asking for help. It\\'s so ingrained in me that I walk into places today and am still so determined to figure out things for myself and not ask employees/help desks for information. Just the thought of having to do it/entering a situation where you know its coming would fill me with red hot anxiety. Like I could run away on the spot. This one really holds you back in life. Today I am more accustomed to it. I worked in retail behind the counter for 4-5 years through college. (that was it\\'s own personal hell). But I kinda reduced the fear a lot over time. I went to go buy a cable recently from an electronic store. I couldn\\'t find it anywhere. Eventually, I approached a worker and said \"Where are the ethernet cables\". He looked so confused and said \"WHAT?\". The worst thing to hear with as someone with anxiety. In a split second you feel nervous, ask yourself \"What did I say wrong? Is this guy going to yell at me?\" Turning inwards and feeling all insecurities explode out into your focus. I said again more loudly \"ETHERNET cables\", and he turned and showed me where they where. Little moments like this, I imagine other people don\\'t remember or acknowledge the way I do. The fact that something so small and unimportant stuck with me for me to be able to write about shows how impactful anxiety is on you. The fixation on past \"failures\" or \"awkward moments\". Yet logic tells me that It\\'s unlikely the worker in that story noticed or cared about my behavior and certainly did not judge me at that moment. If he did, why does it matter so much? These are the sometimes underlying thoughts one must grapple with. The emotions V.S rational thoughts. You feel things that are unpleasant caused by common situations and don\\'t understand/get angry with yourself over those feelings. Then you tell yourself what other people think doesn\\'t matter, then go back to feeling those emotions again. My advice: This one is more tricky because as long as your polite and to the point you can minimize how much you actually have to speak to someone behind the counter. And often if you come into a place prepared you don\\'t have to interact at all (Digital tickets/know where you\\'re going). If this is something you want to overcome, try ordering food in person at McDonald\\'s. (Probably where I first started practicing unknowingly). It\\'s simpler because your just reading from the menu and someone can stand near you if you need it. If you\\'re like me choose one that\\'s not so busy, sometimes the energy of a big crowd can overwhelm your senses. I think remembering the person your speaking to is usually trying to do their job or just answer your question or help you can ease the nerves. &amp;#x200B; The kids \"going through changes\" Not here to repeat any cliches about puberty. Just to note how much more difficult it is to adapt to changes when you\\'re socially anxious. My mom would always say \"you\\'re going through the CHANGE\". I grew leg hair early and it was a lot. It was something my mom especially would comment on. She/ other family would ALWAYS highlight imperfections or changes they noticed on my body. Leg hair, arm hair, acne, height, weight, posture. It\\'s hard enough braving middle school with asshole peers but your own fam making you feel inadequate through teasing is hard. I started just covering everything. Wore long pants all summer, stated avoiding the pool, or exposing too much. Essentially lived like a victorian woman in 1890\\'s. I was so uncomfortable with showing my legs or anything I felt was \"not normal\" I would rather sweat and boil in summer heat then show off my body. This lasted through to high school. Eventually with time It stopped being such a big deal to me. I can only describe it as one day, you wake up, and feel no emotions(or fewer emotions) triggered at the thought of doing the act. So then you just wear shorts. Or show off your body more. Today I am mainly uncomfortable about my weight. I still feel embarrassed about taking my shirt off. I rationally acknowledge that I don\\'t think I\\'m actually as overweight as I think I am and people probably don\\'t see me as fat as I see me. I CAN take my shirt off, but I avoid going to the beach or pools because I compare myself to other more fit people, and feel so unhappy with how I look. This may sound all cliche, but anxiety really takes these things and cranks the dial up to 11. It really impacts your ability to function and changes so much about how you act/what you do/where you go. Advice: This one I\\'m still working on. I think it\\'s an uphill battle (than can be won) if you change how you think. Maturity helps a lot. Getting older and leaving behind all those teenage ideals about judgments. And judging yourself less harshly. I think that\\'s a key to a lot of this. Remember that nobody externally can COME CLOSE to judging as nastily and self-degradingly as yourself. Other people don\\'t experience your day from begging to end. Only you live with all of your memories, behavior, experiences. And therefore the only thing in your control is to slowly change how you react and feel about them. I often say to myself \"be kind to yourself\". It sounds like something you see on a motivational poster in an elementary school hallway. But it\\'s truly worth working on. I think if you stop judging yourself and holding yourself to unrealistic standards of \"perfection\", you can start working on overcoming challenges and having small victories. I saw the path to overcoming anxiety as a straight line with total victory as the goal. But this is not a pass/fail experience! Every phone call, every conversation, I got a little better. You just gotta keep focusing on the victories. (This one sounded preachy but it\\'s my truth.) One thing I heard was this: Imagine your traveling along the same road each day. The road is full of potholes. You keep walking along and without fail always fall into the potholes. For years you keep traveling the same road and keep falling in the potholes. Eventually, your become a little more alert and move out of the way of one pothole. You avoided it. The next day you fall back into the same pothole. This cycle repeats. Yet over time there are changes. Sometimes you avoid potholes. The time it takes for you to pull yourself out of the potholes is shortened. (not doing the analogy justice but you get the point) I felt like this resonated with my life a little. It taught me that overcoming social anxiety is about the progress you make each day and not about achieving some goal of perfection or \"being more normal\". Take a moment and consider how different you are from 1 year ago, and then 5 years ago? I used to be so crippled by anxiety I basically couldn\\'t do anything. Yet somehow I graduated college, survived solo presentation and group projects, worked a retail job, then worked in an office. So if you really want to change, start small and don\\'t give up. The past few days I\\'ve been really anxious and depressed on and off. So it\\'s still something I carry with me. But I\\'m still here pushing and fighting. And telling my story :p ', ' Eye contact. Being in public. I can\\'t do it. Hi, I\\'m 17 thought I was just introverted and quiet but well it\\'s more like I\\'m scared as well as quiet which I guess just makes me quieter than I already am. I mean I\\'m loud and extroverted with very few people who I\\'m close with but that\\'s it. But I don\\'t go outside much. It\\'s not that I don\\'t like the outdoors it\\'s just the fact that there\\'s other people. That probably sounds stupid. The only reason I really go out is because I have school, which I absolutely hate. Thing is it feels like people state at me. I usually walk looking down with headphones just to avoid any of it. But sometimes I\\'ll look up for a second and meet eyes with someone, and it feels like I\\'ve committed a crime or something. Also if I\\'m walking behind someone they\\'ll keep looking back, which just makes me feel like a stalker and makes me overtake them as if to prove I\\'m not, but it also makes me feel guilty for some reason. I only really wear headphones because it means (I think anyway) that people will be more likely to leave me alone. But strangers seem to like talking to me, and the headphones make it more awkward than it should be, because I didn\\'t hear the first half of what they said to worried to ask them to repeat it so I just nod. I can hardly speak to anyone who isn\\'t friend or family. Whenever I\\'m introduced to a friend of a friend I leave the worst first impression possible and then just avoid that person at every opportunity. Well not just a friend of a friend just with anyone who I don\\'t know. I was just thinking of a specific example, even though it was a year ago. I\\'m told that eye contact is a normal thing to do and people expect it and it\\'s rude not to do it somehow. But the longest I can do it is like 3 seconds before I absolutely have to look away. My parents sometimes say things like \"you\\'ve gotten over your shyness\", but that\\'s just not true. Sorry I\\'m going to stop before this gets to long. ', \"If you look for the light, you will find it. If you look for the dark, it is all you will ever see.nnMy first semester of college I tried really hard to get over my SA. While I ended up making progress, it wasn't as fast as I had hoped and I still had a lot of trouble doing some things (such as jogging in public). I ended up getting pretty depressed and the next couple of semesters were pretty much failures as I lost my motivation. I was eventually able to get back on my feet again, partly because I was forced to interact with some people in a group project.nnSA isn't something that can be overcome quickly. It is something that you have to overcome step by step, inch by inch. And there will be setbacks but that is okay. Focus on the small victories, such as actually going to a club, rather than the small failures, not being able to talk.\", \" I feel like my SA is ruining my life. Hi, I hope this is okay to post. I'm 17F, and I struggle majorly with Social Anxiety along with a mix of Aspergers, depression and extreme highs and lows. I am in desperate need of some advice from someone who doesn't know me. I was intending on posting this in the discord server I made and own for people struggling with mental health but ironically I couldn't get over the fear of people judging me for ranting in my own server (laughing in pain), so here I am. My current situation is that I am a year and two months into an art college course. I have eight months to go to get my diploma. Easy right? I've come this far, I can do the rest. Except, I can't. Every day that I'm there, I sit alone, trying to get my work done but for some reason I feel like absolute shit every second of every day spent there. I can't nearly begin to explain how it feels, the best I can describe it is as a physical heaviness on my chest, different from my normal anxiety. Even just thinking back to the feelings is enough to send me into panic. I mentioned at the beginning of this post that I deal with extreme highs and lows, and what I mean by this is that I have two bigger moods in my daily life, (high and low) and then I have normal mood me which for a while I didn't think existed but following therapy I have discovered that that middle mood is there. When I'm experiencing a high, it's almost as if I switch into a completely different person, like an extrovert. I start cracking jokes in front of people, I participate in all conversations, I feel confident and on top of the world, I feel restless and hyperactive. Having a high is completely random, there's no triggers that I've noticed. I also haven't noticed any triggers for my lows. When I'm low, I feel worthless; sad; emotional; silent; slow; unproductive and I get urges to either SH or kill myself. When I'm out of a low, it's hard to look back and remember in detail what happened, as if it's misted up in my brain like an old memory. When I was younger I was extremely depressed, and I SH and attempted suicide many times, so maybe this is a factor in the sudden urge to harm myself when I'm low as a reaction to negativity? I'm not sure. My 'normal mood' is me feeling calm with not much anxiety and no negative thinking, which to me feels like a happy mood compared to what I experience during a low. Back to my situation - when I'm at college and I experience these lows, there's nothing I can do to handle it, I can't just go to bed and sleep to escape it, or wrap up in a warm blanket and avoid all social interaction. I have to sit in a studio with thirty other people, feeling like that, and often times it leads to meltdowns or panic attacks. I have tried listening to music; fiddling with fidget toys; going for a walk outside; watching netflix; talking to lecturers about it; focusing on work; taking a break from my work and doing different art; drinking water; breathing exercises; sitting in the bathrooms; texting my partner; planning shopping lists. None of these coping mechanisms work. One thing I have noticed is that I either have a low, panic attacks or I get that physical sad heaviness on my chest that feels suffocating every single day at college, which I think has created a fear around attending the course due to having no escape from these emotions and feelings. I've only had a high at college about four or five times. I do remember a time at the beginning of the course where I didn't feel the suffocating heaviness, just the casual anxiety around people. I used to have friends on this course, we were a group of five but this year they've expanded the friendship group, which is all the people on the course. Socialising with four other people was enough for me to come home exhausted and needing to recharge, but I can't handle socialising with a group of 30 odd people. Since then, I've isolated myself from the group - not that the original group have really tried to involve me in the new group. Another thing to add is that I've never been able to maintain a friendship for longer than a year, my boyfriend of almost two years is the longest relationship of any sort I've had. Is this just me, or does anyone else have the same issue? I went on holiday with my boyfriend and parents for three days last week and my god, I felt free. I did feel anxiety and some strong emotions but they felt reasonable because I was in busy environments like a swimming pool or a restaurant. This was great news to me because I thought, hey, this is what life can be like. Then I came home. Hell broke loose within me. I couldn't get myself out of bed to go to college, I haven't been there in almost a week and my attendance is poor enough as it is. I can't work up the energy to shower. I don't feel hungry. I can't even get up to brush my teeth. I don't even want to do art, I've tried, it gives me too much time to think. I've tried sleeping it off, but then the next day comes too quickly and I have to rinse repeat. I'm having about four or five panic attacks a day and a night. I'm keeping my boyfriend awake because we're both scared that I will end up in a mindset where I can't take it anymore and I give up. I can't think about the future without melting down. It's mental and physical hell. I thought it was because of college that I feel this way, that I've had a taste of freedom and I've realised that college isn't it for me. But I'm not sure that's it. I was going to drop out, frustrated and disappointed in myself that I can't make it another eight months to get my art diploma but was confident that I'd be taking a step towards healing my mental health. Then came the bad news, my mum told me that if I drop out then I need to get a job to pay rent because she can't afford to keep me here if she doesn't get government benefits for me. My boyfriend (19M and a full time worker) lives with us, and we're currently sleeping in my parents front room in the side of the house. We've already been told that if we don't move out soon they'll kick us out. We've been looking for places to rent but nobody considers us because we're so young. This has only worsened my anxiety, and I know that I probably seem quite pathetic because I'm scared of working but it isn't just that, I've worked before and I got fired for having panic attacks. It isn't just an unreasonable fear anymore, it's my worst fear at a job come true. So, my choices are: 1. Drop out of college to save my mental health but be forced to find a job and pay rent which will only worsen my mental health anyway, leading me down a path of feeling suicidal for a period of time and then attempting suicide. I've been down that mental path before too many times and I don't want to die so this choice doesn't seem like a good one for me. 2. Continue college for the last eight months, continue feeling this mental hell that I so badly wanted to escape. Get my diploma, be forced to get a job when the course ends anyway. Go back down on the same path of mental health and feeling suicidal. Again, I don't want to die. This is where I'm stuck. Both paths worsen my mental health which I don't want. And I appreciate that not many people enjoy school or working, but to me this isn't just about lack of enjoyment, it's as if there is something in my body that physically stops me from doing it. You know when you have two magnets that are facing the wrong way so you physically cannot connect the two? There's always that distance as you try your best to grip them in your hands and force them together. That's what I experience in my chest, and it's not just an emotion, it's as if there is actually a magnet in my chest. Like, no matter how hard I try to just push through and do these things like jobs or courses, there's a force that won't let me. Believe me, I'm frustrated at myself too for being such a failure. And to address the paths of feeling suicidal, I'm not talking about it like that to be dramatic, I mean it in a way that it's my life pattern and I can't fix it, no matter what I try. My mental health deteriorates, I keep going through it and try my best to get through to the light at the end of the tunnel, but it gets too much, too many lows, too many bad thoughts, too much for me to take. I either take myself to hospital, or I attempt suicide. And it's easy to just say well why don't you push harder, try for longer. I've tried, either way I end up in the hospital waiting room. I've attempted three times this year, the last was this Summer, where I was in the waiting room with my boyfriend from 9:45pm until 11am the next day after being promised a bed on a ward. I was discharged within an hour of being seen. Having been so many times with no help or answers as to why I'm like this, going to hospital isn't an option anymore because obviously there's nothing they can do for me. It hurts so bad that there's nothing I can do to make this better or to make this go away, I don't want to die and leave all my pain to my boyfriend, but I want to not exist anymore, it seems like the only option I have that isn't months and months of torture followed by attempting suicide as a result of it all anyway. My boyfriend is an angel, he didn't sign up for this when he met me and I feel like such a burden on him, but he insists that he'll always be there for me and he compares it to when I was his rock when he was depressed and anxious but he was strong enough to not give up, unlike me. Is this just bad social anxiety? Or is there something wrong with me? Does anyone else feel like this? I hope this made some sort of sense to somebody out there. TLDR; I have two options of continuing college or getting a job, but both feel physically impossible due to anxiety and bad mental health. I fear both paths will lead to me killing myself. \", 'I got social anxiety trying to roller blade. So I am 24 years old. For some random reason I have been wanting roller blades and I haven’t had roller blades in years. So I finally got some and went to try them out this evening. I went down to the parking lot of my apartment building, got on my feet realizing that I may have forgotten how to roller blade and slowly make my way down the sidewalk. As I’m rolling, I hear a man in the parking lot say, “I see you rollerblades!” Immediately loosing focus I veer off to the rocks almost breaking my face. The guy calls out asking if I need help and I say no thank you. He continues to offer assistance saying how he doesn’t want me to fall and I realize I can’t run away because I’ve got the dang roller blades on. I fall again and he and his two friend come towards to offer help me around the corner but I say no thank you but I’m just practicing. The original guy still offering help starts kind of flirting saying how he’s the type of guy to make sure I don’t fall. I make my way away and fall behind a bush, I take off my roller blades, walk up the back stairs so that they can’t see where I am going and go back to my apartment. I was probably outside for a total of 5 minutes. The moment the guy spoke to me I wanted to run. Now he and his friends weren’t creepy about it they legit saw me struggling and didn’t want me to demolish my face. And the guy who offered to help in the first place was actually pretty cute. I really hate how my anxiety kept me from trying more on my roller blades, which I’ve been wanting to do but also made me miss out on interacting with some seemingly nice people in my neighborhood. I just can’t figure out how to overcome the urge to run away from any interaction.']\n",
            "['Self worth and anxiety. Hi guys. 25 (M) I am new here. I just had a question for ya Do you think anxiety is tied to you self worth? I have always felt if I was financially stable, independent form my parents (horrible relationship with dad extreme verbal abuse as a kid, not that good of relationship with family overall, also was teased a lot in school ). And if I was successful ( I have been before, which did wonders for my confidence while in college ) I felt that all my anxiety would just drift away and I would be alright. When I get nervous I start to sweat extremely bad in my face, and its super embarrassing. I know its all physiological and how I view my self, and how I think others are viewing me. When I turned 19 I first tired bettering my self. Started working out, got hobbies,writing,running,reading, (photography) which is my sort of my profession now. Staring to be more serious about life. I had even tried nofap for 2 months. And I wont lie doing all this gave me amazing confidence. I even sating dating a track star at my school! Thing were going great, but still something was amiss. I still had to call mom and dad for cash, still had to listen to there complain about money and fighting with them even through I was off at college. I got the sweats less, but still had them and still got panic attacks around people. Around 22 I ended up trying Xanax for a while which made everything perfect. Then I realized that this quick fix I could not use forever and I gave it up which sucked (withdraw). I really don\\'t want to go back to it. It ended up controlling me I felt I needed all the time to keep up my \"persona\" 2015 has be the worst year of my life After breaking my leg, having my room mate move out (which ruined my credit) on top of that losing a ton of money for medical and surgery and physical therapy(had to sell most all my possessions) , running out of money for college, forcing me to move back with my parents for almost a year now(which as been hell for me been super depressed and such). Almost joining the army to get my life back on track sine that looked like the only window of hope. Then last month ended up winning a photo grant for 10k. Now in 1 in a half months when I get the cash I am going to travel abroad for 4/5 months see the world (got the travel bug last year) and get back to my life and pursuing my passion(writing and photography) and after my trip moving to LA with one of my best friends. Also back in school online atm till I move back to California to finish my degree. So ya things are looking really good right now! I really think getting my life back on track will cure my anxiety( this will be the fist time in my life I am a 100% independent, For some reason I feel like this is it. I will be cured ). Always when I gained something, (success,confidence,hobbies, sense of focus) my anxiety got less. Am I being to hopeful ? Please guys give me ya thoughts and stories!', \"Pushing Myself Massively. I'm going on an overnight camp/hike with a couple people I see at my gym from time to time, and who I've spoken with for all of maybe ten minutes ever. One of them is particularly friendly and he brought it up, so I do feel welcome, but DEAR JESUS YOU GUYS. I would literally skydive alone sooner than do this given the option. I have never done anything like this in my life so spontaneously. Part of me is proud, and the other 95% is continuously vomiting, drinking the vomit, and re-vomiting. If I never post again it's because they killed me in the woods.\", 'You are not your inner critic.. Hey everyone. I wrote this a while ago to cope with some real life issues and stumbled upon it recently. I thought this sub might like it. There is an inner critic behind each thought and each word typed out in front of me. None of my writing has to make any sense to anyone but me, but it’s as if it’s in my nature to have it make sense for others as well. Words are just used to express feelings and thoughts that I have in order to relate to another individual with similar experiences. And so other people also have thoughts and feelings that they try to convey through their words, but I wonder how often those thoughts and feelings get mixed up or portrayed inaccurately when they’re trying to convey something. Maybe we all have difficulties expressing who we really are deep down. Our inner most self is rarely seen by others. If we can pull down the curtain for others to see our true self we will not hesitate to do it. There must be some circumstances in place to do so. First off you must trust in that other individual completely. If you can’t open yourself up to another person’s opinions then you will not be able to convey your inner most self to others. You must trust that you can handle whatever another person throws at you. Other people are unpredictable and that’s flawed… Other people are good deep down, but their thoughts and feelings can also be misconstrued like ours. We see the thoughts behind our actions, but rarely do we see others for their thoughts. Their actions are much more easily seen. Their actions are instantly seen and judged rather than pondered like they should be. Everyone is trying to deal with their own demons and we are no different. The struggles of humanity come from the same seed of despair. We are all struggling with the purpose of our existence. Some seek refuge in faith, while others escape to different worlds through books or video games. There are no surefire ways to live our lives in this world. We are all given this opportunity through the sheer coincidence that the universe has created for us. There is no tangible thing that will bring us the peace that we seek. That peace can be found within ourselves and through the bonds that we forge as we live on. The people around us are also suffering, so we might as well take solace in the idea that we are not alone in our suffering. Our scars may look different on the outside, but they all harbor the same feelings of sadness and despair. These feelings pave way to the love that exists only when we’re vulnerable with one another. It’s no secret that we won’t be on this earth forever. Why waste time judging others for their misdeeds or interests when you could be enjoying life? It’s a pity, really. We’re all so engrossed in ourselves that we rarely see others for who they really are. They’re all like me. They all have loved ones. They all would love to make a friend who they can spend time with. They all want something to believe in. As I’m typing this, other people are also living their lives in their own worlds. My world may be different from theirs, but each world is valid in its own right. I don’t need to fear the criticism of other people. That brain power can be spent on solving my problems, rather than exacerbating them. The biggest hurdle in my 20 years of being on this earth so far is challenging that inner critic that tells me what I should be. It tells me what I shouldn’t do more often than not. It tells me I’m not good enough to stand amongst my peers and be myself. That inner critic is as real as me, but it doesn’t have to be if I loosen its grip on me. When I run that inner critic comes out and realizes it has no power. It keeps saying “I can’t do it. I should just give up. I don’t like this pain.” After a while that voice realizes the futility in its words. Overcoming that voice in one area of life shows just how it can be achieved in all other areas. Persistent effort is the key to any positive change. It takes more than a few words of encouragement to get past this inner critic. It takes determination and it takes time. Nothing happens instantly. No real change can be done in a day. Habits form and within those habits are the key to a good life.', 'Just Started Running - A Question to My Socially Anxious Friends. With the new month, I started running again. Always has been one of my favorite things. I try to leave the house by 6 AM to beat the arrival of people being that I run at a school\\'s track, kinda a popular running area. Somebody arrived right when I was leaving which made me feel like they thought I was leaving because of them. Plus to make things worse I was laughing when she got there because that episode of friends \"The One Where Phoebe Runs\" popped into my head. How Rachel says when Phoebe runs \"She looks like a cross between Kermit the frog  and the six million dollar man.\" I was laughing out of control. Anyways my question to y\\'all. What do you do when you run/ walk by somebody on the street. I would go to the other side of the road back when I was younger walking home from school. But that\\'s such an asshole move, or is that just me in my head? What would you do? PS: Oh  and I\\'d like to add I run (  and walk ) really fast. This is so annoying because I will get so much unwanted attention. I don\\'t know if its the way my legs are but if I try to run slower I feel like I\\'m galloping like a horse. Jogging really slow is just the most uncomfortable awkward thing. So because of this I will like lap people on the track if anyone\\'s there. Just the awkward icing on the cake.', 'Group effort. I believe we should help each other out with our social anxiety. Meaning we have to practice in real situations, such as going outside and dealing with places that makes you anxious together.

To actually not spend 10 hours a day on my phone / playing video games and go outside and do something with my life', ' Studying.. Do you guys study by yourselves? I feel like people who are more social and study in groups tend to do better than people who study on their own. It makes sense because in a group, people can all share their own output and one person may be able share knowledge that no-one else knew. For example, I was having trouble understanding a concept for a quiz that I had last week, so i said, \"Fuck it\", and went to school early to study in the library and maybe ask for help. As I went to the library I saw a group of my classmates studying together for the exam. At first I was hesitant of approaching and asking for help, but I forced myself to do so because I realized that the pros of understanding the class material and challenging my social anxiety were greater than the cons of avoidance and not knowing anything on the quiz. So I went up to them and said, \"Hey guys. Do you understand how to do the problems because I am completely stuck.\" Then it went on from there. After we did some of the problems, we conversed about a bunch of different topics and I actually enjoyed it. I think I still didn\\'t do that well on the quiz but many people seemed to have trouble on the same questions as me. It would\\'ve been way worse if I didn\\'t ask for help. One last thing I realized was that for the past few weeks, I\\'ve noticed that I dislike being at home alone all the time. Instead of skipping class or other outside events, I want to go. I wasn\\'t like that before. I would always dread heading outside. I think it\\'s getting better now though.

I wanted to put this together to help as many people as possible that are trying to function with social anxiety, which as you already know, can be extremely hard. I also want to say that in no way, shape, or form have I defeated social anxiety. These are tips, advice, and helpful things that can and will improve your quality of life and diminish your social anxiety. Most of this comes from my own experiences and also from what people have said about their own experiences in reducing/overcoming social anxiety. These will not only improve your anxiety but also your life in general. Stop masturbating and stop watching porn(if you do): A big reason for a lot of people's social anxiety is masturbation and porn. I won't get into the specifics too much but a orgasm from porn triggers a neurotransmitter to go off in your brain in a very large amount called dopamine. Such a large amount and especially at a high rate(if you orgasm to porn a lot) can cause anxiety, depression, among other things. Stopping this alone can do so many things. Able to talk to girls better, more energy, and being relaxed in social situations are all benefits of stopping this. Also if you are addicted to porn and masturbation(which might be you) this may be harder then usual. For most people that are addicted, full benefits are usually seen about 90-110 days after stopping. This is the time is takes to rewire your brain. Also the time may vary depending on the severity of your addiction. Healthy diet: Stay away from sugars. To be a healthy person, doctors say we should only have 37g of sugars a day. To put that in perspective a regular pack of skittles has 46g of sugar. An excess amount of sugar also triggers the dopamine transmitter which as you know, can do bad things. Stay away from sugar as much as possible. It is not good for you in any way. Try going after healthier things which can have great effect on your mood and anxiety. Cold showers: Not only do cold showers build willpower, they also are proven to decrease depression and build testosterone, which can help your anxiety tons. Cold showers are also very refreshing and can provide you with much more energy. The next chance you get, take a cold shower(not a cool shower) and see how you feel afterwards. I honestly didn't know what to expect but when getting up for school or work, they can take the grogginess away and you'll feel much more capable of tackling the challenges the day presents. Limiting time spent on phone/TV: So much of us with social anxiety get caught into this lifestyle where we're always on our phones, games, TV. Don't get trapped into this lifestyle. Do activities and build hobbies that you will enjoy. Start reading a novel. Start playing a sport. Do something other then coming home from work or school everyday and going straight to the TV. Exposure to social interactions: Some of us hide away or avoid social interactions or things that give us anxiety. One of the best ways to become more comfortable and relaxed when in these social situations that you dread is by doing them. Build your confidence and experience in these situations. Greater anxiety in the present is less anxiety in the future. I'll tell you how I am currently doing some of these things. 1. My job: I got a job at Monkey Joes. If you don't know what that is, it's a inflatable place where kids and families can come to jump around and have birthday parties/gatherings. Part of my job is hosting parties. Which means in front of 16-60 people I have to host a party. Also this party is in somewhat a enclosed room where most of the time people are standing/sitting right next to eachother. I have to give out orders, make sure the mom and dad of the birthday boy/girl are satisfied, help with anything that needs to be done. Also I have to speak in front of all these people and let them know what to do. My first party, I was terrified. I've now down about 5-6 and guys, I can't even put into words the difference this has already had on me. This helped me in so many ways like being in big groups, walking into places(like classrooms) with a lot of people and so forth. It's amazing the difference something can make when all you have to do is just simply apply yourself. School: As much as I can, I try to ask questions, and start conversations. I've made so many friends this year that I wouldn't have imagined making a year ago. Try to ask questions and talk to people your interested in talking too. Join a Toastmasters club(when you are ready): A toastmasters club is a group of people who meet up and give speeches to each other to better their skills at public speaking. This is a great way to challenge yourself and anxiety. It's also a great way to become a better public speaker which is a good skill to have. Running/working out: Not only does this get you in better shape but running or working out can build testosterone and also release a lot of built up anxiety. As you know, testosterone is good for people with anxiety. It can build confidence. If I've had a stressful day or have a lot of anxiety, I'll go on a 30min-hour jog with music and feel tons better afterwards. Drugs: Stop smoking weed: I used to smoke weed a lot. I think it actually had to do something with causing my social anxiety. I stopped smoking weed and felt loads better in the future. THC is linked to causing social anxiety so watch out for that. Not only did this help my anxiety but I was also able to focus on my school and sports much more. My focus in the classroom was also improved. Meditation: I, personally, have not tried meditation before. As you've probably heard though, it can do some pretty good things. People have said it's worked wonders in their life. Look up good techniques and try them. Also, if you do meditate, feel free to comment on your techniques and some benefits meditation has. Be prepared: When in school, knowing what the class is about or what the discussion is about gives me way more confidence then if I don't know what anything is about and I'm clueless. I've found that when I'm actively doing my homework, studying for tests, and maintaining a high grade, I have less anxiety/more confidence in the class and also around my peers. Don't just do the work or get by with a D. Become actively engaged in what's being taught and you will find yourself very intrigued and applying yourself more. Limit Stress: Sometimes, life is very overwhelming. Try to get things done beforehand and create a schedule of events/things that need to be done. You already have anxiety as it is, don't stress yourself out even more with things that need to be done. Get things done ahead of time to where you feel you have an adequate amount of time to yourself. Respect yourself and value yourself. Don't cheat yourself by letting deadlines go back and slipping up on due dates. Your only digging a deeper hole for yourself. I hope this can help you and your anxiety.\", '\"She\\'d rather stay alone.\". I am visiting a German host family I used to live with. I don\\'t know why I thought three weeks would be an appropriate amount of time spent here. In retrospect, one day would have been plenty. Anyway today, the family are having two get-togethers. Right now (lunch), they have the mother\\'s parents over. In total, there are six people: Father, Mother, Son, Brother of Mother, Mother of Mother, Father of Mother. Later (dinner) there will be some other people, I believe again there will be a total of six people who will stay for a second christmas and until New Year\\'s. Anyway so as per usual, I\\'m alone in bed still. I\\'ve decided to spend the day doing positive things to keep my mood up as I usually get really depressed during celebrations, and I know tonight at midnight will be rough. So I\\'m writing on my journal now (while redditing), daydreaming about positive things, I will later continue to plan a project I\\'m doing, read a book I am absolutely in love with, eat the best food in the neighbourhood and stuff my face, go on a walk when the sun goes down and brace myself for midnight. But anyway as they were about to eat lunch, the father asks me \"Would you like to join us? It\\'s totally okay if you say no.\" and so I tell him \"I would rather be alone.\" in my most apologetic voice. I know the Father and the Mother are used to my antics. I lived with them for a year, and barely saw them. They know I have social anxiety and have come to accept and respect it. I still feel bad whenever I decline spending time with them but six people, three of which I am not really used to? Too much. Arg I\\'m tearing up just thinking about it. Anyway. So as he leaves, he announces to the others \"She would rather be left alone!\" and then closes the kitchen/livingroom door. I feel so damn embarrassed and annoyed at myself. It\\'s like I\\'ve actually failed them, and they\\'re getting annoyed at me as well. Part of me wants to leave early because now it\\'s just ridiculous. I\\'ve been here for 11 days and have spent the last four or so in bed all day, sneaking out to eat, shower or brush my teeth only when they\\'re away or too busy/loud to hear me. I hate myself. I truly do right now.', \" Ideas for places to go that arent very busy or expensive to try and get exposure?. So I'm trying to get out more to try and conquer my anxiety but I'm having a hard time coming up with places to go that aren't super busy and are free or cheap. I've gone to antique stores, home depot, maybe some furniture stores, some parks. I don't need a real reason to go, I just need to have places I can go to to try and get some exposure but I'm falling flat sadly. Any ideas? Thanks. I hope this can give some other people some ideas too. \", \" Does anybody else neutral face look like they're sad?. I haven't noticed it until middle school but some of the kids ask me why don't I smile and I thought well nobody else smiles and they aren't getting asked that.

Here's an example of what looks like: I still have the problem and I've tried gently smiling but it hurts keeping my face like that and I end up having my mouth twitching trying to keep it up and that looked weird. And since I'm trying to get out (by taking swimming lessons) and make friends. I don't want to make anyone I meet uncomfortable with my statue like face piercing through their souls like I'm judge them or something like that. Any advice or anyone that can relate? \", \"Story of me beating social anxiety!!. Warning: this is going to be a long post. Hello, I just joined this sub Reddit and created this account just for the sake of getting my social life back in control. Before i go any further i would love to talk about where i was 4 years ago. Since i was a kid i always wondered why i am I so weird. Why can't i do social stuff like everyone else, why am I always scared, why do i stutter when i have attention of a group of people. These questions always were in my head until when day i found out about social anxiety and finally i was like i have the answer. Now i can look for a solution to treat my social anxiety. I think i was like 16 when i found out about social anxiety, although i was in India at that time so didn't had much support for it plus basic teenage stuff was going on in life. Getting bullied, being ashamed of being skinny which hurt my self esteem really bad, not being able to express my feeling to the girl i liked. All of this made my anxiety worse and i started to avoid people. Move forward to the age of 19 i come to new York, i feel now my life is gonna change. Somehow magically being in new York will turn me into some confident social bird. But i was wrong, i started college and things aren't changing i am still anxious around people have low self esteem, don't have a gf, skinny sf plus i am developing depression now. On top of that my mindset is changing into a mindset of a victim, i always feel like i am being attacked by people. This goes on for few more years and somehow i survive. Now I am 21, fucked up. Social anxiety is so bad that i can't even get out of house. I fucked up my semester in college and gpa is all fucked up. All i do is play league of legends whole day and i am only eating like one meal a day. Plus i am broke af don't even have money for food. I had it enough i said i have to change myself and will have to take control over my life. I had this burning feeling inside my body which i couldn't get rid of. So i started to taking, i did the following: 1. For first month i practiced getting out of house. I would go carts thinking about how do i get out of house. But i committed to it sometimes i would just walk outside for a minute and comeback. 2. Second month started to take walk outside house. My goal was to take walk a in places with lots of people, which is easy to do since i live in nyc. While walking my goal was to observe my anxious thoughts and try not to react to it. I read this book called power of now, where i learned about this concept of observing your thoughts. 3. Next I got a job as a salesperson. Holy shit that was a nightmare i have no idea how i even survived that, it was just crazy i wasn't event able to talk yo customers. I wanted to avoid that but i had no choice. 4. In college my goal was to ask questions in class. It was awkward though but i had made up my mind. I am not going to live like this, i have to beat this social anxiety. Now fast forward to 2017, one of my best years in life man. 1.I crushed it this year, i started my ecommerce business for which i worked my ass off and now i am making decent money. I am also about to launch my own social media agency. Plus i am part to so many entrepreneurial communities on social media. 2. Last semester i had one class where i would i was the most social person. Everyone knew me, i would make jokes and stuff. 3. I joined gym and went from 115lb skinny dude to 140 lb guy although i haven't been going regularly to gym recently. 4. Went to tony Robbins event unleash the power within! It was really crazy crazy. I am really into self development and tony is one my favorite person i look upto. 5. I went on a trip. 6. I tried to pickup girls, lol. It's fun but it's scary at times. And more stuff which will only make this post longer. How did i do it? I really believe that what we focus on is what we become. So my whole life i focused on social anxiety but in last few years i have changed my focus from anxiety, depression to the person i want to become. I try to focus more on what my goal is and how can i achieve it. Also i feel you have to have a sense of like enough is enough. Frustration and anger have always been my fuel, they give me so much energy to push myself further and further. Do i get anxiety? Yes feel it everyday it's just matter of taking control over it. Decide if you want to give in to anxiety or you want to win over it. Also i recently read something cool about anxiety, instead of trying to call yourself being anxious call yourself as being excited as anxiety and excitement are similar emotions. So by doing this whole meaning changes. Although i haven't been doing things i used to do and getting kind of comfortable. Recently i started to stutter when asking questions in front of big group so i have start working on social skills again. Ask me anything guys. You want to message, do that. I will do anything to help you need any advice. I am here to grow and help others grow. Peace🙏\", ' Exercise, working out, less social media, and confidence.

I turn 21 next month and for the longest my sister (because I have virtually no friends) has been bubbling with ideas on what to do. It’s her boyfriends birthday too and they’ve decided to celebrate both of ours at a bar. Now this bar is a very ‘involved’ one. It’s one of those “ hey table 2 number #_ come up and sing”- or some shit. They’re also inviting a shit load of strangers. Of the little friends I have I’m the first to be 21. Needless to say it’s been keeping me up recently and I’m having nightmares about it. For the longest I’ve been hinting about not wanting to go. And last night I finally broke it to her. I tried to be as serious as I could and went “Hey I don’t wanna celebrate my birthday doing anything.” And just like- explained to her that I’m not comfortable going there. She ended up laughing in my face and saying “you’re going.” And it just really pissed me off and we went back and forth. She eventually texted me apologizing and saying I don’t have to go. I know many people might go “you really need to get out of your comfort zone.” But it’s not that damn easy. I’d like to think I made great strides just last year. I regularly leave the house for shopping or to go jogging. I finally got a job. I even went alone to get my first piercing and it was great. But I just cannot do a fucking bar- not at this point in time. I don’t even like celebrating my birthday and never even imagined I’d like going to a bar. I don’t know the whole deal just pissed me off. More-so because at this point I feel like my family should understand I have issues and how much it affects me. But they honestly don’t and they don’t believe anything I say I have. I’m just wondering how long it’ll take for them to realize I’m not okay. Do I have to go “hey mom I’m not happy ever and I always feel like I’m gonna have a heart attack!” “hey mom I think about suicide a whole lot!” Anyways I just wanted to rant- how did everyone else spend their 21st birthday?', \"Collectivism is narcissism founded by psychopaths over cowards; any1 else not like being saddled with the bulk of the work or little to none in group projects?; how2rebuild social skills?.

Shorter than everyone in class, even shorter than the girls. Somewhere along the lines (probably around 14/15 years old) I stopped being shy, and started being very social. At 18 I lost a lot of weight and became very good looking which helped a lot too. To this day I feel very confident, and I’m very good in social settings BUT I’ve developed a deep fear of blushing. It all started when a friend jokingly screamed “why are you blushing?!” In a crowded place randomly, and since that day I’ve had the fear of blushing. I function just fine outside because of wind and fresh air, also when it’s dark (in the club, movie theatre etc). But in a light and warm environment the fear intensifies, and I usually end up blushing BECAUSE I think so much about it. Is there anyone else here who experience the same thing? Any tips?', 'How I Got Rid of my Social Anxiety (Not a Panacea, but things that helped me). First of all, I know this post is long, bear with me. I’m writing this post to be the message I wish I could’ve read 2 years ago. If I had understood then what I understand now, I could’ve saved myself so much pain, embarrassment, and loneliness. I hope his helps someone out there. Even if your experience is somewhat different, I guarantee there is something in what I’ve been through that might help make sense of it all. **TLDR**: I went from fully socially comfortable, surrounded by friends, outgoing and friendly, to depressed, thinking anxious thoughts all time, desperately uncomfortable around other people. At that point, I did everything I could to figure out what went wrong, and how I could fix this terrible problem. The two main factors in the development of my social anxiety were an addiction to my phone/computer/Netflix/Reddit/Youtube, and increasing isolation from other people. **How my Social Anxiety Developed** A little background about my life. When I was young, basically up until high school, I never had a problem with anxiety. I spent tons of time with my friends, perfectly fine social skills, played sports, no problems with depression or anything like that. I’m 22 years old now, just finished four years of college. I think kids growing up today are dealt a much harder hand than I had. Internet addiction and compulsive smartphone usage played a huge role in my becoming isolated, anxious and depressed, and I imagine there are lots of kids out there who are maybe going through something similar, but without the foundation of a normal social childhood/early years. I started to develop anxiety around other people in high school. I had friends in school, through classes and sports, but didn’t spend much time with them outside of school. At the end of the day I would usually go home and spend time on Reddit, Youtube, Netflix or watch pirated movies and TV shows. My family had some serious problems, so I didn’t like to spend time with them. I would just go into my room alone, and try and take my mind off my problems with entertainment. My family was pretty poor, so I’d be hungry often, not have a lot of energy, and just want to unwind in bed with my laptop. I spent a lot of time doing that, especially over the summers. I went off to college and everything turned around for me. I was lucky enough to live in a college dorm with some great, kind, wonderful people, and I became good friends with many of them. I made an active effort to spend time with my friends, and I had social interaction every day. It became so easy for me to spend time with people. I was the happiest I’d ever been, and figured I’d grown from my awkward high school days and I was cured. I didn’t realize it could ever be like that again. My senior year things became worse for me than they’d ever been. I’m not proud of how I responded to a difficult year, but I honestly did not understand what was wrong with me, or how to fix it. I was swamped with difficult classes on top of working 20hrs a week at a job I hated. I had a bad habit of procrastinating until the last minute, and it caught up with me. I became constantly sleep deprived, was close to broke all the time so I started barely eating, just trying to will my way through the work I had to get done. I started finding it incredibly difficult to focus on reading technical research articles, having to go back and reread paragraphs over and over again. I became terribly uncomfortable just answering questions in class. When I started missing assignments and classes, I avoided my friends so I wouldn’t have to explain. My mind started to become uncomfortable, even alone. I numbed the pain and constant anxiety by going on reddit, youtube, Netflix, mindlessly browsing looking for something to make me smile or laugh, just something bright in what became a daily experience of feeling depressed, sad, anxious, all the time. I would be on my phone or listening to music almost constantly. I would constantly be thinking about how I was missing work, letting down my family and friends. I didn’t want to open up to anyone. I was incredibly ashamed. I ended up failing two classes, attended my graduation since grades weren’t out yet, and just lied to family and friends. I told no one that I had failed, just held it inside. I moved back home with my parents, took an easy job where I figured I could take time to figure out what went wrong, and go back to finish my degree after a semester or two off. It’s been just about a year now since I failed, and I’m going back in the fall to finish. **Symptoms of Social Anxiety, How it Played Out in my Life** Once I moved back home, I took a job where I had infrequent social interaction, and I spent very little time with my family. Problems with social anxiety became worse than they had ever been. I would feel anxious when people walked up to me, I would feel anxious just doing something as simple as ordering coffee or walking through a grocery store. In conversations, I would try to make normal, comfortable eye contact, but lose track of what the other person was saying because my attention was on eye contact. I almost definitely came across as dumb or unfriendly. And that’s not me being too harsh on myself; I’ve spent most of my life friendly and pleasant to be around, I understand how I was coming across, I just couldn’t figure out how to be socially comfortable again. I was literally losing track of simple conversations, or my responses would become simple and short. This was very embarrassing for me. I became uncomfortable just being with other people, so I isolated myself more. Every day just kind of sucked, I was always worrying about how I came across to others, always worried in general. I became very depressed and lonely. Started smoking weed frequently, playing video games, watching movies, just looking for something good after a day of awkward interactions, of being judged, of feeling alone. Almost all of my friends from college lived far away, so I saw them very infrequently. **How I Got Rid of the Anxiety, Became Socially Comfortable Again** A big part of trying to get better was keeping track of how I was spending my time. I started writing an hour-by-hour log every day of what I was doing. Then at the end of the week, I’d review how the week had been, what areas I needed to focus on, what mistakes I kept making. At the end of the month, I’d do the same process. I started bringing a small notebook with me everywhere I went, and took down quick notes on any ideas or experiences that I wanted to be sure to remember later. I wrote in a journal, infrequently at first, then more regularly. I recommend doing something to keep track of life, it makes it easier to identify trends and progress. I stopped compulsively using my phone, and I cut back the time I was spending online, on reddit, watching youtube. All the time I would spend flicking my attention from link to link on reddit, always taking in content, never producing my own thoughts, was hurting my attention span. I found it harder to become engrossed in books and long form content than it was when I was younger. This was a real problem for me my senior year, and I am sure that my constant use of reddit and social media was a factor in my difficulty concentrating and getting work done. All that time on the internet was hurting my attention and putting my mind in an anxious state of staccato, quick thoughts. I am 100% sure that my overuse of the internet, reddit and youtube in particular, was having an adverse affect on my mind. It was taking the place of the natural human state of mind; longform, uninterrupted production and operation of thought. I started a habit of meditation every day. Essentially you sit quietly, and pay attention to sensations, emotions, and thoughts as they arise. I can’t overstate how important this has been to me. It is a peaceful 10 minutes at the start of the day, where I can relax, don’t have to worry about all the real problems that follow me around all day, and begin to understand the operation of my mind. I use the Waking Up app, highly recommend it, it is exceptionally well made. If you can’t afford the monthly subscription, like me, the creator Sam Harris offers a free yearly subscription, you just have to email the address in the app description, no questions asked. I started spending more time with people who I loved, who wouldn’t judge me. This is the most important part. I was always anxious to talk with people, because I wasn’t doing it very often. And when I did talk to people at work, they were strangers who didn’t know me, so if I came off as shifty or nervous they would pick up on that, and the interaction was often uncomfortable. My mind would then associate interaction with that unpleasant experience of being judged, of making people uncomfortable. Some of my good friends lived an hour or so away, but I knew I needed more social interaction, so I made the drive, over and over. After I spent an hour or so with my good friends, I started to feel relaxed, and was more able to get into the conversations, without thinking about eye contact, being self conscious about everything I said, etc. The key to feeling like my old social self was in large part this right here. SPEND MORE TIME WITH FRIENDS. I was lucky in that I had friends out there who loved me. I know some people don’t have anyone, and when you are awkward and anxious it is very hard to make those connections. Don’t give up. I started stretching and exercising every day. For me, anxiety and depression went hand in hand, and moving my body everyday had a huge impact on my depression. Obviously exercise alone won’t fix all your problems. For more information on depression I recommend the book “Lost Connections” by Johann Hari. It helped me a ton. Or for a quick runthrough of the book, listen to his interview on Joe Rogan or Sam Harris’ podcast. Exercise and stretching (look up beginner yoga routines on youtube to follow along with) helped me correct my posture. After going through four intense years of study, often sitting hunched over a desk, or looking down at my phone, or just lounging on the couch, living a sedentary lifestyle in general, my posture was becoming a serious problem. Mind and Body are fundamentally linked, so if you want to feel comfortable in mind, it helps to feel comfortable in your body. Start off slow if you need to, go for a short walk at least. Even on my worst days, getting out of the house and walking the dog helped a little. I started eating more healthy food. I switched to a regular diet of mostly eggs, meat, fish, vegetables, fruit. I figured stick to the foods that our species has evolved to consume. I’m not a nutrition expert, but eating like that, and getting enough to eat, meant I had a stable baseline of energy throughout the day, instead of being tired all the time. **Tips for Social Interaction** When I started spending more time with people, I was very rusty. I felt as if I had forgotten a bunch of the fundamentals. Here are a few things I find helpful to keep in mind. Eye Contact. I made so many mistakes when I was trying to get back to my normal social self, particularly around eye contact. Our species has evolved to convey and understand information through facial expressions and where we look. So it is important. Where you look says a lot. In general, when someone is talking to you, by looking at them you give the message “I am listening to you, I’m interested in what you’re saying, you are heard.” One mistake I was making was I would think “alright, be friendly, make eye contact”. But I would be so uncomfortable and unused to the experience, I would think about it too much, I would focus intensely on the eyes, and would be so focused on eye contact I wouldn’t even process what they said. So I’d give off a message that’s very off, too intense, and if I wasn’t listening to what was said I had to look away and kind of process after the fact. You basically want to get to a point where you aren’t thinking about eye contact. That’s only going to come from repeatedly going into social interactions, and eventually getting to aplace where it doesn’t make you uncomfortable, and you can just use your eyes to convey meaning. As a general rule, try and be relaxed, be friendly, and look at the person that’s talking to you. You don’t have to stare them down, just relax your gaze so you’re not pinpoint focused on only the eyes. You want your attention fully on what the person is saying to you, not on eye contact. You don’t have to force eye contact. If you aren’t too comfortable with it, that’s alright. As long as you pay full attention to what’s being said, you’re alright. If you come off a little shy because you’re not making a lot of eye contact, that’s ok. It gets easier the more time you spend with people. For an idea of where people generally look while in conversation, watch a youtube video of an interview with someone you respect or admire, and see what they do. Or just pay attention to how the people around you make eye contact. People tend to comfortably look at the other person while listening, and while speaking people tend to look away often while thinking, kind of checking in with their eyes every once in a while. There’s not one right way to do it, just do what is comfortable and effective for you. What to say. A lot of my anxiety around being with people was from not having much to talk about. Part of that was I was wasting so much time online, I really didn’t have many interests or recent experiences that were engaging to discuss. In any case, it’s always a good idea to try and talk in terms of the other person’s interests, if you want them to be engaged in the conversation. When you are just getting to know someone, ask questions about their life that you are curious about. Again, the more you do it the easier it gets. Ask about their life, what they do, what they like, what they dislike. Try and find out what they are really interested and passionate about. For example, if they keep bringing up Basketball, take note of that. Ask about their favorite team, did they play the sport in high school, whatever comes to mind. Or talk about whatever’s in the environment, or coming up at work or school. This post has gotten a bit too long, hope this helps someone out there, if you have any questions please post, I’ll respond when I can.', \"Im wasting my time. I just really need to vent this, my head is about to EXPLODE full of stress, but i just look at things and I worry why i cant be normal and cant dig myself out of loneliness. Just a heads up, its gonna be a long one if you are on mobile.  and#x200B; I wanna give some background, I live in the UK, sometimes I feel like this place is alien to me, even though for the 18 years ive been on this earth, ive lived here. I felt like i've never truly fitted with people, i dont think i'm an odd person, just my mental health is so poor, its comes off like that. Parents always called me a shy kid (I was quieter but i think i'm naturally a more chill person), I don't think that really helped my situation, because i wasn't suffering from it then, I remember still being able to be normal in public up until around the age of 13. I have faced a lot of bullying in my life, sometimes from my own family without them knowing it,up until the age of 16, maybe not to the extent of what other people have faced, but it seemed to affect me a lot more. I will say that anxiety does run in my family, so i believe it is partially down to genetics.  and#x200B; Right, I wanna cut deep into the bullying, I wanna start with my family, obviously i know families have a bit of it, its just natural, but I feel like they instilled fear into me for stuff that did not need it. For example, i still get anxiety from listening to certain types of music in my house incase someone hears it and says something about it, i remember one time, when i had my first phone (i had one before but my parents kept taking it off of me), there were music ringtones on there, i couldnt possibly remove them, they were system locked, my dad finds them one day on my phone, plays them and everyone in the house laughs at me. Or another example, which has hit me the hardest of them all, Social Media, they scared me into not getting, made me fear it cus i was too young for it, I might agree, but they made me avoid it like the plague, until 16, when I got facebook and Instagram finally (I had twitter at 13, buts its not really that kind of place, but I still cant bring myself to add my family on there let alone most people I know. In other forms of bullying, When i say i am not an odd person, well I definitely used to be, up until i started college, i was very weird, and was bullied to death in school, people would play 'punchies' on me just for fun, and well, me being a skinny kid, I couldnt really fight back with conviction. I admit, im an emotional guy, and that i ruined a lot of friendships for me, cus if one thing went wrong, id storm off, at least these days im able to battle off that emotion. I was made fun out of in every single way possible, and its beaten every single last ounce of confidence and self esteem I have had.  and#x200B; To put this into perspective, this is how bad my problems go to; I cant go outside without feeling a strong urge of anxiety, I cant add anyone on social media, even if I know them cus I dont trust anyone and im afraid they will also reject me, they have to add me, which of course, no one will because no one cares (honestly, i feel like i just really hate my area), so ive ended up with only like 30 friends on facebook, similar number on insta, I do have snap, but i think you dont really gotta add everyone on there, since its more of a private place. I feel really incompetent at doing anything by myself, i feel like i have to do stuff for a strong reason otherwise i flake. My anxiety out in public goes near panic attack levels, I wouldn't say i go to that, but I sometimes ill get a dry mouth and body just doesnt want to deal with the pressure, I also cant move my body normal unless i'm confident, which is a more weird quirk thats been given to me by social anxiety. I never had a girlfriend, never even had a first kiss, never even attempted to really chat up a girl, i feel like im gonna end up as one of those people who is in his mid 20s, and still in that situation. I dont even like people looking at my phone, I refuse to pull it out on public transport unless its pretty empty.  and#x200B; I feel so isolated all the time, my phone is constantly dry, I have tried some positive things, like meeting people online in various ways, a lot of those people I really like too. I've really tried to keep positive this week, but today its just went haywire, i woke up with a real big feeling of loneliness, i just felt the need to cry, I didn't know why, and now its just making me think about stuff too deeply.\", \"I'm lonely and worried about myself. Hello, I'm 19 and still live at home. I recently quit a retail job that was distressing me pretty badly. I haven't been social at a healthy level for a couple years now (since maybe 14 years) and even then, I only had the one friend I depended on way too much. I haven't been able to go outside much. The thought scares me because I feel like I would look suspicious doing anything. I feel guilty all the time for things I haven't done. I feel like people hate me as soon as they see me. Which it doesn't help that I'm overweight. And I want to go outside and exercise to lose weight. I'd love to be able to get to a place (physically and mentay) where I can run because I love it so, so much and it helps with my emotions but I can only do it for a few short bursts. And I find it very hard to talk to anyone I don't know. I feel like I come off as cold and rude. I'm not meaning to, I really try to be nice to people but I think my expressions and tone don't match my intentions because people close to me say I look and sound angry and mean. But with family and their friends, it's difficult to talk because anything I say they kind of just stare and me and don't really respond to what I'm saying they just go back to what they were talking about before. Like if I say anything everyone goes quiet and stares at me. Then they don't respond. It makes me feel so bad it hurts my stomach. Sorry if this isn't the right place for this. I guess I'm looking for advice on how to have a little more confidence? And see if anyone has these problems?\", ' I came to the fucking beach wooooo. God I’ve been wanting to come all summer. And I’ve just been putting it off. Yeah I’m a little uneasy since there’s a lot of people scattered around but I am proud of myself. And I am enjoying myself. I think I will come a lot now. Can I get some likes for this win????? ', \" Man I was just like that about a year ago. At some point I just got fed up with that ridiculous tension that I would put on myself. One day, and even still to this day I take a walk around my local park just with the intentions of saying hi, or smiling and giving a nod to everyone I pass. I still struggle doing that to people my age (particularly girls) but otherwise I've noticed a lot of progress! It's gotten sooo much easier the more I do it. It might seem like a baby step but at some point the steps grow on their own. \", \" Something that I did early on in my journey to better myself was taking walks around my local park. My goal was to acknowledge every person I passed, at first I would start with eye contact and a nod with a smile, now I've moved on to actually saying hi to whoever I pass. I still struggle when it comes to people my age, but thanks to that practice I've had I was able to land a customer service job. \", \" I agree and disagree with you. Saying it won't help is wrong. I had SA that was so bad I wasn't able to look for work or go to school after high school. At some point i got so fed up with the way i was feeling and not doing anything about it that i just tried exposure therapy on my own. I started small like you should and just had the goal of saying hi to everyone i passed on my walks around my local park. From personal experience i can say that exposure therapy is probably the best thing you can do for yourself. I have a long way to go to I've also come a long way, all without professional help. I'm not saying i don't advise it, but i am saying you don't need it. Also going into you worst fear will surely fail, definitely take small steps and gradually grow over time. \", \" I know the exact feeling. The first time I actively tried to make eye contact with a passer by on the street I physically felt my body resisting, like I'd decided to walk into the path of a moving car or something. But when nothing happened I instantly realised how normal it was and how capable I was of doing it. My advice would be to try things out on random strangers in passing as even if you mess up you know you'll never see that person again and whats more you get an endless amount of retries just by walking down the street. Treat it like a research experiment. Be willing to actively sacrifice your comfort zone for a few seconds just to see what happens. Then you can return to normal. \", \" Whilst I have a fairly active lifestyle now, I know how it feels to spend so much time indoors you think you're starting to forget how to do normal social things. My advice, get a bike. Go out for a ride at least once a day, just for fun or take a trip to the shops or something. It really helped me feel like I was active in society and you know it's keeping you fit so you don't feel like such a waste of space all the time. Plus the endorphins you get will help uplift your mood and temporarily increase your confidence. It's a great way to feel like you're doing something without really doing anything. \", \" Really awful if you truly wish you had people you could be around. Here's a start though: go somewhere, either outside or wherever alone. Sometimes the feeling that you are doing something helps on the self-esteem which helps you socialize because confidence = better chance of social success. \", \"I'm in the exact same situation. I'm a sophomore in college, living with some random roommates who I don't really have much in common with. When I get out of class on Thursday at 2:00pm, the only reasons that I can think of to leave my apartment are for food, the gym, and the occasional concert. I just try to keep myself focused on the future instead of my current situation. Take a walk, go get some food or coffee, just put yourself somewhere public and just keep yourself calm. Read a book, listen to music, do whatever you feel like. It's kind of weird, but just repeating to myself 'This is normal behavior' while sitting in public and drinking coffee really helps. 'Reach for cup, take sip, place cup down in secure place on table, take a breath, this is normal.' Fight the flight response.\", \" Just realized that sounded like an ad. Anyway, any activity you can do outside (for me it's guitar), try doing it on your front porch :) it might seem terrifying but it's a small step that does actually involve talking to anyone \", \" Overcame one of my biggest fears today!. So today I managed to make an important phone call. Not only that, I didn't overthink it afterwards! Now I feel motivated to go out for a walk and maybe make another phone call just to practise a bit. \", \" Hey, thanks for your message and for the welcome! I do have some hobbies already, Although they aren't really that social sadly, I like drawing and gaming. Another thing I like to do is going for a jog with that friend of mine. I do find that exercising really helps with the depression. Or just simply going for a walk can really lift your mood as well. I've also applied for a new course that starts this September, hopefully that'll work out! Again, thanks for the message! \", \"Me and my sis have social anxiety. Sometimes we go get coffee or food. We also go to yoga class which has a lot of people but you don't really have to talk to anyone becuase its a quiet setting and you can always hide in the back of the class.

Just drop everything and go to Nepal, or Tibet, or the Himalayas or something and live off the land for a year with no technology and no contact with the rest of the world, spending my time hiking through mountains and meditating with Buddhist monks. Like when Bruce Wayne leaves Gotham to travel the world and train with ninjas, then returns home all enlightened and shit and becomes Batman.\", \"Since you're 19 right now and still have time to plan, start saving up cash to attend a special event on your bday! You could travel somewhere for a weekend vacation alone, go out to a music event or play you think looks interesting, or even treat yourself to a wilderness hike on a forest trail. For my 21st all I did was go out for Chinese food with my bf and then spent the evening alone in reading with a glass of wine and some cupcakes. :)\", \"What I started doing is leaving the house every day. Yes every single day. If I didn't have anything to do (like work I even as small as buying something at the supermarket or posting something) I like just go for a walk to an area with people.

I will help people out whenever I can. I love being there for people and being able to make their day better. I have some inner turmoil over whether or not I am actually a good person or if I just delude myself into thinking I am. I get worried that I only help people to make me seem like a better person to myself, to justify thinking that I am one. I try to be fair and kind to everyone, but what if I am only fooling myself? I have met people in my life that just seemed so fake. Yes, they seemed nice, but you could see through it as an act, that they were just humoring the situation. I am scared I am one of these people except everyone but me can see who I really am. I am basically friendless. I have one good friend who has an SO and a kid with another on the way, and then couple people that I meet to have drinks with. I am a mess about this. I try my best to be a good person, but if I were one, wouldn\\'t I have people that cared about me like I do them? Anyone I reach out to ignores me. I can\\'t figure out why. Am I obnoxious? Am I so boring? Do I really contribute nothing worthwhile enough to have people want me around? I like to learn things. I like discussion. I like to share nice things I think about people. I will admit when I am wrong. I try to make everyone have an enjoyable time doing whatever we are doing. I have really bad anxiety. Sometimes this doesn\\'t allow me to be myself, so I seem really shut off/ bored/or boring. But it is only sometimes, and to make it worse it usually happens when someone does finally get back in touch with me after I asked to hangout. I think, \"Oh man, they want to hangout? No one wants to hang out with me. If they do they will just end up regretting it since everyone else does. Or, if it goes well I will just ruin the friendship another time.\" I have gotten better at hiding it, I think, though. I think I am fun. I like who I am. I am always open to bettering myself. I wish people could just be honest in what they think of me. I have seen someone distancing themselves from me (it is a common enough occurrence) and have intentionally pried into their reasons as to why, full well knowing it would be a faux pas, only to get transparent pleasantries and excuses. Which is reasonable if I put someone that is trying not to be close to me in a intimate spot. I didn\\'t care that I was vulnerable. I just want to fix myself. I have never cared to be popular, or be in the spotlight. The small moments I have been, it is nice, but it is not something I seek at all. I just want people I meet/know to walk away thinking I was nice to talk to. That they had a good time sharing my company. It would be even nicer if I could have taught them something, or them pleased after I told them they taught me something. As much as I want those things, I cannot allow myself not to be me, though. I am very honest. I will not lie about anything, and the times I am forced to (socially, for some situation I cannot explain otherwise) you can see through the discomfort on my face. I have been called blunt, but I try to be tactful at all times. This leads to me brushing people the wrong way sometimes. But I cannot think of a time where the people upset by this trait were people I cared for. As I said, I will willingly admit that I am wrong. I think it is really important for people to admit that they are. You cannot know everything. Not being able to admit you don\\'t makes you fail as a human. People I remember writing me off as an asshole are people that don\\'t share this sentiment. For nearly a year I have been depressed about this. I broke up with one of the best people that has ever been in my life because I felt I wasn\\'t good enough/just would keep her down. I lost a group of friends when I started dating her because my ex was the out-going hub of the entire friend group. So, me being around made my ex sad (I am not sure of better word) and the times both my gf and I went to a gathering it made my ex very uncomfortable. So I stopped getting invites to things.. then I stopped getting responses when I would try to plan something. This made me depressed, that either my friends didn\\'t like me, or they liked someone who they know treats people poorly better than me because she was more fun. For a couple months after that I tried reaching out to people and no one cared to talk to me. At this point it was hurting my relationship with my gf. I started to feel bad that I couldn\\'t be the person she fell for. I was too depressed to be me. And the days I felt like myself I still would get pangs of chest pain because I knew that she should have someone that society felt contributed. (She convinced me to quit my terrible job because she thought that was what was destroying me. Which, it was, but not all like she thought. This was also good advice from her point of view because I had a LOT in savings from doing nothing but working at this job. So leaving to find a job to better my happiness was a good thing to do.) I was jobless and friendless and the fact that she wanted me, as twisted and sick as it is, made me I stop loving her. She deserved someone better, so I made that choice for her. I wanted to be better. I wanted to be someone she deserved. So I started trying to be a person. I went and got a real hairstyle (I use to just use clippers and do it myself.) I started running/biking again. (I have chronic hip pain from my old job, so it made me lose my favorite thing to do.) I got over my anxiety of going to a gym and signed up for one. I went an bought a new wardrobe because she always dressed so nice and I just wore running/work out attire. I enrolled in school, which is something I stopped when I went full-time at my job that had mandatory over time 2-3 hours a day. In school I started strong, I was ahead of everything, getting close with my professors and the head of the department so I could get connections for an internship. Then my anxiety hit me, hard. I couldn\\'t finish my resume because I am a 25 year old with nothing worthwhile to say on paper. I lost the internship prospects, hurt my relations with my professors. That caused depression, my grades started to slip towards the end of the semester. My 4 A\\'s fell to near F\\'s and I was lucky enough to find some willpower thanks to a nice classmate I knew from an old job and rounded my grades to C\\'s before the end. Even though things went well for awhile, it didn\\'t matter. Nothing changed. No one cared. I ended things last November with her. I was motivated to better myself until April. I went to the Gym every other day, I ate healthy, I wasn\\'t excited to be back in school, but I did it and took pride in doing so. But the pride in myself diminished to nothing. I still had no one to go have fun with. No one texted how I was doing. I even stopped getting likes/conversations on Tinder, which was my last resort for a quick pick me up. I am lonelier more than ever, and I have been without close people most of my life. I use to get on cams to flirt/make fleeting friends before. Or teach people English (which is something that brought me joy.) Now the only connection I feel with people throughout the day are the 5 or so upvotes I get on something. I use to be a lurker and only send messages when I saw people hurting or if they seemed like they were remarkable genuine people for something they said. I would just tell them I would be here to listen for the former case and that I appreciate them if it were the latter. I use to get conversations from those, but now nothing. It is as if the world is intentionally turning its back on me. Since April I have basically laid in bed. I still go run/bike and work out at home, but it is a fight with myself to do that. I browse reddit, read books, masturbate, play league, or just lay in bed and scream in my head about what is wrong with me. I don\\'t know if anyone knows how truly unhappy I am. I don\\'t know if they know about my situation and feel awkward/helpless about it, so they ignore it, or if I am really fooling people. I don\\'t want to be a burden so I don\\'t talk about anything. When my brother\\'s girlfriend asked why I wasn\\'t leaving for classes I told her I missed the deadline to enroll because I was depressed a friend of mine passed away. Really though, we were no longer friends because she was part of that old group. I would have loved to be friends with her. She was one of the very few people that genuinely seemed to be happy to see me the entire year. I was especially torn up about losing someone that I use to call friend, and one that genuinely seemed to care about me (she cared about everyone. She was an amazing person) but even had that horrible thing not happened, I wouldn\\'t have gotten out of my bed. Why couldn\\'t the world have taken me instead? I can\\'t find any strength in myself. I don\\'t know what to do. ', ' i feel socially incapable.. Getting a job just seem like a nightmare to me because it means getting to meet new people, going through interviews and such. yet i need money. and i feel like freelance is so hard to gain a decent paycheck from. i hate taking phone calls unless obligated. i hate having to hang out with family/friends. or having family over. unless it’s my parents. i hate having to go out to the big city because it’s too crowded and lively. i’d rather spends days in my room, with my laptop and technology stuff and go out to the sea/beach when i want to. one with none on it. i feel incapable of it and scared, immature and weak. i don’t want to seek professional help, because it cost too much and it’s too far away. i live in a small city, thanks god.

So there is this girl I \"volunteer\" with, we see each other maybe once a day, hardly ever talk except for the occasional greetings. Anyways, I have a mad crush on her. I think so, anyways. I feel like there\\'s no way I could know what love is if I\\'ve never been in a relationship with anyone. But that\\'s beside the point. She\\'s only the third, maybe second, not sure, person I have had a crush on even though I\\'m already 20 years of age. She is absolutely gorgeous and funny and smart and I really want to get to know her but as you might already guess, there\\'s this gnarly thing called social anxiety. Now I think usually SA doesn\\'t hit me particularly hard. I can go outside, I go to work everyday without feeling overly anxious, hell, I plan on going on vacation alone to a far away country soon. But the environment I get stupidly anxious in is when around \"peers\", people roughly my age. I feel like I don\\'t fit in because I don\\'t partake in the same activities as they do (like drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes or pot, \"socialising\"), or because I simply don\\'t consider myself interesting. I mean I\\'ve got a few hobbies like listening to music or travelling (well, usually it\\'s mostly thinking about travelling, shit\\'s expensive), but I feel like people might not care about those things enough, I don\\'t know. Just as I am writing these passages (rewriting, over and over and over...) I realise how groundless my \"thoughts\" about this are. Of course one can have a great conversation (theoretically anyways, I seemingly can\\'t, I feel like I\\'m shit at keeping conversations alive, probably due to lack of practice) with an absolute stranger about these topics, I mean why not? Many, many people travel, even more so people my age, and I can\\'t imagine anyone who **doesn\\'t** listen to music. Anyways, whenever I do end up in a conversation with others my age I end up just being in the background, listening to what they say, not contributing anything beyond laughing at their jokes. And if I don\\'t already feel stupid during those situations, I **will** feel stupid afterwards because I\\'ll think the others will think of me as weird, \"remember that guy, why didn\\'t he say anything\", \"why does he laugh so weirdly\", \"why does he keep looking at the floor\". The few times I did manage to break out of my shell I ended up dwelling on what people would think of me nonetheless, or I feel like I embarrassed myself due to the shit I ended up saying. Which is why I end up keeping to myself most of the time, I\\'m afraid of the stupid stuff I would otherwise end up saying. I feel like I\\'m a nuisance to people, even when they invited me to gatherings, because they could obviously do without this weirdo in the background who giggles occasionally and is otherwise dead silent. (Note: I hate how my rants always end up like an convoluted stream of consciousness.) So on monday I had to do this small thing at work, she basically had to do the second shift. When she arrived, I greeted her and basically fled the scene. I wish I would have maybe stuck around and had a chat, although even to this day I honestly can\\'t think of anyway I could have pulled it off without looking weird. On the second day she arrived and I sort of ended up asking her if she needed help, which she said yes to, so I did because I had plenty of time on my hands. We actually ended up joking around a bit, which I loved, but we were otherwise largely busy so no time for chit-chat. She wasn\\'t there today but she actually wrote me a message (holy shit yes) asking if I wanted to help her out for the next two days too. Of course I said yes! There were situations before where I might have had an opportunity to get to know her more but I always blew them by overthinking things and being too shy. I\\'m afraid I\\'ll blow this perhaps final chance with no one to blame but myself. I feel like there have been signs she might like-like me too, and othertimes I feel like she tolerates me at best. And the thing about her is, she seems to be shy at first too. Which I absolutely adore, however it hardly makes it easier for us to get to know eachother. Man, in situations like these I sometimes wish I could just go back to the apathetic depressed self from a few months ago instead of being this hopelessly lovesick and still-sometimes-sorta-depressed weirdo.

I am 20 year old virgin male who has never been in a relationship, I'm not really sure if I am ugly but my brothers lightly drunk friend have said so and is the reason I have no success with women. This coupled with social anxiety has lead to me being isolated from my peers at uni and resulting in no social life. Overall I'm not fat by any means, I regularly go mountain biking and this has kept me in a really good physical condition. moreover, I have a good well paying job lined up as a civil engineer when I complete my last few semesters at uni. However, I am immensely afraid of leaving leaving university, as it is my only means of potential social interaction with girls. I know when I start working as a civil engineer I will be unable to socialize outside of work as I am terribly afraid of going out (bad experience at nightclub when previously mentioned brothers friend and some others essentially made me go to a nightclub, I just sat down on a stool for 3 hours feeling pathetic and useless than I ever have). Taking this into account I am fairly certain after uni I would have lost all chances of meeting a girl.

Two girls who were camping near me came down to the beach and like a total coward I just kept my distance and didn\\'t say anything to them. I barely greeted them when they said \"Hi\" as I passed their camp. I was pretty brief and shy with any other campers I came across as well.

I was kind of shocked since nobody ever just approaches me in a friendly manner like that.

Get out of your head!. For real. Spending so much time *thinking* and being inside my own head is probably the biggest reason i have social anxiety. I'm training myself to stop this. And it's actually not that hard. Get your head up. Have a look around you. Pay attention to the people, the things, the smell and the sounds of the world you're in. It can help you see things for what they really are. I was in a family barbecue today, and instead of worrying about what to do or what to say, i just enjoyed the hell out of it. \", \" Got so fucking lonely that i ended up going outside. People say that if they gave in to their anxiety they would never go out again. Well, today i learned that that ain't true. After days without leaving my place and seeing other people, i just reached my limit today. I started feeling desperate for human contact. I went out, visited some relatives of mine, rode my bicycle around the neighborhood and it felt great, even though i was still anxious. If i had friends to hang out with i would totally go to a bar today. \", \"Relax, always remember to breathe. It's very, very, very unlikely that things will be as bad as you think. Try reading a book, listening to music or whatever it is you like doing to relax, maybe go for a walk. Exercise tends to help clear the mind. Also, make sure to eat right and sleep enough. Your mental state is closely linked to your physical health, so if you don't take care of yourself you're only going to feel worse. Lack of sleep especially can really make you oversensitive. \", \"If you think it's because you're not used to the situation, then the obvious thing to do would be to go for it anyway and try to get used to the environment. (Easier said than done, of course.) You don't have to go all out immediately, of course, but maybe doing smaller, low pressure things with a friend could help you acclimatize better. Go for a walk, run errands, play a game at home or wherever you're comfortable, that sort of thing. nnI would also recommend looking up a few breathing exercises, as focusing on something else can often help with nervousness. You could also try telling someone you trust about your problem, so they can help you calm down when you feel nervous or nauseated again. You might be having overstimulation/hypersensitivity issues, so taking an occasional breather while out being social might be all you need. nnThat said, I'm no professional. If this keeps up, you'll want to see a therapist or similar who's better suited to help you overcome anxiety. You can't just keep avoiding people forever, after all. Well, you could, but that's no way to live.\", \" I am 15 years old new in high school very anxious. Hello i am new to high school i hate PE and i even hate it more because i can't run for 10 seconds. It was okay i participated in PE because all of my classmates were like a family to be after 9 years being in same class. Now i am in a class with 30 boys and only 10 girls and they look all athletic and i don't even go outside in summer i can't play basketball. I fucking hate my life i would've commited suicide if my mom didn't love me. If i get suspended from PE i think it will make my anxiety worse and i just vomit blood and had fever because i am too stressed \", ' Dude this ENTIRE post is what I am going through. I’m like...going crazy is silence because of this and I cried yesterday because I felt like I was trapped in my body and can’t escape this hell of feeling worthless, stupid, disabled and (my own personal dilemma “ugly as hell”) and though I do not think you are disabled I can totally understand how you FEEL disabled. It hurts a lot for me and I can imagine for you too, so know you’re not the only one and I am going through it too. People, including my momma, told me these struggles such as memory/focusing/“feeling dumb” is a symptom associated with anxiety, the anxiety is so severe it interferes with our ability to focus. It’s not that we don’t have the ability, the anxiety is just blocking our mental capabilities out. So we’re smart and strong mentally, we just struggle with the anxiety and depression aspect. My mom has advised me to read, work out, do things that improve cognition and focus, and to do what it takes to not allow anxiety to get in the way of that. Which dude I know it’s so much easier said than done. I hate that I do badly want to connect, so badly want to talk to people, so badly need others but I don’t know how to approach them, how to verbalize what I want to express to others, and I’m scared that they’ll judge me because I lack some education I guess and don’t have an opinion on so many topics. Even if I was educated I feel like I don’t relate to half the people who talk ghetto or are, like, idk how to explain it but basically modern youth personalities and interests...I used to but now that I’m so insecure and feel like I’m not pretty enough to care and I don’t know how to connect at that. That may sounds stupid as hell but it comes down to the truth:(. I was going for a walk trying to stop crying but I felt like I couldn’t even handle my surroundings where people were walking out of their cars, houses and there would be a chance someone waves at me or tries to talk to me...even though I’d love to I’m too insecure. I hope there’s a way we can get better, I have more faith in you and know it is possible for you I just don’t know about me. :( ', ' Crushed by SA. I\\'m 18, M. I will be starting uni in 3-4 weeks. In arts. I feel like I\\'m going to fail and I feel like I have no future. Sometimes I\\'m enthusiastic about it though. But most of the time I feel like shit. I was afraid of people of my school even after 3 years, so guess I\\'ll feel great surrounded with people I don\\'t even know (spoiler : I will not); not to mention that the uni is in the capital so I will have to take the transports everyday, with crowds full of people in a hurry... It\\'s the first time in my life that I won\\'t be able to return home to feel safe between classes. I do know a friend who will be in my class though, but in our group of 5 friends I was always left out : I\\'d see them going out to bowling, McDonald\\'s, or simply hanging out together, always without me. Guess I\\'ll stick to her unless she gets rid of me for better people who aren\\'t awkward and lame like me. Can\\'t really blame her for that, I\\'m getting used to it anyway. I\\'m spending all of my holidays in bed doing nothing. I\\'m too scared to call the doctor to get an appointment. I don\\'t even have a desk so I can\\'t practise anything. None of my \"friends\" are down to go out to do anything with me. I want to go out, I want to go outside. I want to wake up early, take the bus for the capital, go through the shops even if I don\\'t have a lot to spend, maybe buy a cute thing or eat a burger, or just walk in the streets and laugh. But I have no one to do this with. I\\'m terrified of going through the shops alone. I\\'m scared of people outside. I\\'m afraid that if I go alone to buy something like the cute cat watch I saw last time I went to this shop, people will make fun of me or will tell me I was dumb for buying it (\"that\\'s some stupid shit...\", \"you can find better and cheaper stuff on the internet...\"). So I don\\'t go alone. What\\'s the point of it anyway? I want to go to the swimming pool and swim all day. I\\'d like to get there and not care about anything around me, just swim in my own bubble (pun kinda intended) all day long, and when I get home I\\'ll be exhausted, but the good kind of exhausted, not the today-I-did-nothing-but-laying-in-my-bed kind. I\\'d like to think that if I manage to step outside and start walking there, everything would go fine by itself then; but even if I did get through it and reach the swimming pool, I\\'d be too worried about the people around me to enjoy being there. I\\'d be awkwardly swimming, worrying about what the others think of me (even if I don\\'t think anything about other people swimming and I know they don\\'t think anything of me, I know it but I still can\\'t proceed like a fucking normal human being), not to mention I hate my skinny body thanks to nearly every fucking person in my life mocking me for it. In the end, even if I did reach the swimming pool, I\\'m sure I\\'ll get out after 30 min and just walk home crying. It\\'s always like this anyway, whenever I actually want to do something, I have no one to do it with and I just chicken out because I literally can\\'t go alone, I just can\\'t. This, or either I just simply fuck it up. And then I get even more scared of the outside world for the next time I have to go outside. I remember when I was trying to fight SA with \"small victories\" like buying X thing to the grocery store. I don\\'t quite know when it fought back but it doesn\\'t matter, I just eventually lost to it. Again. And it\\'s crushing me, and it\\'s ruining my holidays. On the bright side, I have an amazing boyfriend who\\'s very supportive and knows how it feels, so maybe when we move in together in a few weeks, I\\'ll be able to go swimming with him. But that will be the beginning of our first year of uni, so I don\\'t know if I\\'ll have the time/energy/motivation. In the end it doesn\\'t matter since he\\'s at his grandparents\\', and I miss him terribly, and he\\'s not there so I feel trapped in my room. I feel like I\\'m such an annoyance when I talk to him about it, even if I know he doesn\\'t feels this way, and I\\'m too scared to reach out to my other friends. So here I am, hopelessly posting here without any goal. I\\'m sincerely sorry for having made you read this random shuffle of panicked thoughts and I sincerely wish all of you an amazing day/night as well as much courage against SA. ', ' I do this, but only with really small things. For example, if I\\'m talking to someone at work and they are talking about outdoor activities or how nice it\\'s been outside (if it\\'s been really sunny and warm) sometimes I will lie and act like I enjoy it as well. If I was honest I would say how I hate warm weather, the sun drains me, I\\'d rather be inside playing video games, but that would make things awkward I think 😂 I hate being \"fake\" but I feel like in a professional environment a lot of times I try to fit in more with everyone else, just to be safe. Maybe that\\'s not a good thing, but I think it\\'s kind of a defense mechanism. ', 'Just got back from a solo backpacking trip.... I was solo backpacking Nepal for 2.5 weeks, most of the first week was spent trying to seclude myself, often to the point of missing meals to avoid interacting with other backpackers. During my hikes I would be alone for hours at a time, yet any peace I seeked was short-lived, and would be lost to self-defeating thoughts. I would surrounded by the most beautiful scenery, yet I would feel nothing except loneliness. Eventually, the solitude was too much, and I had to go back to the city to recuperate, at which point I noticed that every interaction I had with another was like resurfacing for air, each time get easier and more natural to do so. After being home for only a week, my social improvement has become apparent. It can get better.', ' I dont know whats wrong with me and its making me horribly depressed. Ive changed a lot in the past 6 months (r/nofap, r/pornfree) but now that school is out im having a hard time hanging out with friends. Its been 2+ weeks and all ive done is stay home and play xbox. I only plat for a few hours, so when im not playing im either working out or watching netflix. Any time my mom invites me and the family to go to the beach, i decline, because i feel weird about never socializing with friends and only going outside to hang out with my family. Ive also realized i dont really have much in common with my friends. One half of my group smokes weed, (which is all ive ever done with them, im sure they do other things.), and one half makes music and all i ever see them do (through social media) is practice their music. I want to initiate something, but i dont know what to do since i dont have any interests, really. I thought this was social anxiety, but i seriously think im either super depressed but just feeling bored, or maybe im fucking autistic. I would go to a psychologist, but my mom would make me drive myself and ill fucking panic. Last time i went, i told him i was \"fine, and my mom just sent me here for some reason\" and ended up getting nothing out of it. Then theres the financial issue. Im 18 now so im pretty sure shed make me pay for any medication myself, and she keeps pusbing me to get a job, but every time ive gotten a call back, i pussied out. I think i should pursue the interviews, but if i actually go and do it, ill be like \"wtf am i doing here, im out of place\". Shes mentioned me paying rent, and i think i have like a little over a week to get a job. Even as i type this, i cant fully express what my actual problems are, and im the same way in real life. If i were to go to a psychologist, id start talking about my problems and then once i see them looking at me id stop and say that im fine, since i feel weird being weak. I know this is already long and i dont even know what im trying to say anymore, im just totally fucked up in life and i have no real direction. Telling my parents about this would be a dissapointment somehow. ', ' I only ever hang out with my family.. Now im visiting my grandma and i dont wanna do anything with my family. I dont wanna go to the beach or the pool or anything. I cant enjoy myself around my family because of my lack of a social life. ', ' Going to the beach. Not sure if i want to cause ill be going with just my 2 brothers while my mom is doing something else. I dont know what i should be doing there. Like i know i can go swimming but ill be there for 3 hours or so and would likely get bored after 20 minutes in the water and just sit on the beach looking at the water or other people for the rest of the time. This fear is making me not want to go at all. ', \" Making friends as a loner. Just quick facts about me. Closeted gay guy, social anxiety, depression, loner. So I see this guy semi regularly. Maybe once a week and have/had a little little tiny crush on him. Every once in a while we'd have a little conversation. Maybe walking the same direction for a bit. Him liking women came up organically(just mentioned he thought a woman was hot). That and some tiny things makes me pretty sure he doesn't like guys. So I guess this means move on. I don't want a relationship anyway. I'm too screwed up. Too asocial and have no hopes and dreams, lazy as hell and unwilling to do anything to change it. So I guess him not liking guys is a good thing. Anyway. Post is about friendships mainly so here it is. He told me I should call him on the weekend so maybe we could do something like go swimming and gave me his number. When things are happening my brain kind of forgets to send the anxiety and depression signals (although it absolutely does send some but I feel like I don't have time to dwell on it as much in the moment). So up until I got his number I did want it. I guess it was partially because there was still a chance he might like guys and my brain just wanted more time with him cus I was or am kinda crushing on the guy. But as soon as I got it that meant decisions. That meant over thinking every little detail like crazy. That meant I have to make a decision to call or not this weekend. I hate having stuff to do in the future. If you say let's go to the beach right now I may say fuck it let's go. But if I have to make the decision by Friday I will most likely (90%+) spend days anxious and second guessing any decision i make going back and forth between yes and no meanwhile knowing it's gonna end up at no. Cus no is easier. Removes future decisions and decision/social anxiety. Life is just.. simpler alone. I'm so lazy. I read some definitions of loner and yea.. how I feel. . Someone that likes being alone . The type of guy who dosen't have good social skills, No confidence and jealous traits. . Known as 'the boring guy', the 'friendless' guy, the invisible man. Being socially anxious and withdrawn I have little to no social skills. Sometimes I think I don't even care. Like I can't connect with people. Just want to be alone. In groups I may as well not be there. I barely say a word. I'm also stupid. Don't know anything about the country or even damnit city I've lived all my 24 years in. So I don't want to talk partially out of fear I'll say something stupid or wrong. I used to have 3 friends. One best friend the other two I didn't hang out solo with much. Mainly we all 3 hung out together. That was in like 8th grade. Then I moved. I hung out with my best friend still every now and then. Then never. I haven't talked to him in years. I now have 0 friends. That's not an exaggeration. I have no people I hang out with at any time in real life. I'm in a kik group where I've known 4 or 5 people for close to a year but that's it. And a friend from the same country on Skype that I do nothing else with but watch TV shows. Also go swimming? I'm a lil chubby and have stretch marks and self conscious. Don't know if I want to hang around half naked with better looking people including that guy - the possible new friend. Anything that requires any effort is like.. nah easier to do nothing. I would be okay with doing nothing for the rest of my life. It would get boring at times but it beats feeling like shit. Anxiety and depression and maintaining relationships. I'd rather just not have any obligations. Not have to act somewhat normal. Just be alone. I'm fine with how social I am online. I meet my needs. Online relationships are .. here comes that word again.. easier. No having to look and react (body language, facial expressions) and I can just close the app or whatever whenever I want. And it's way less of an obligation(hey at least I'm consistent). It's anywhere from 1 minute to hours depending on what I feel like. Actually doing something is hour or so before to get ready and you can't do anything else cus you have to go in an hour or two. It's possibly hours of doing stuff. Feeling akward. Then get home. It's a whole day versus 20 minutes. The eternal struggle. I ranted a lot huh. Also since I only have his number (he doesn't have mine) I'll be the one who has to initiate contact. Or just do nothing. Which im 99% sure is going to happen. \", \" I'm hesitant when it comes to going into cars with no tinted windows.. [I don't drive] I know, it's pretty pathetic. I hate riding in cars when they don't have tint. When a car stops besided me, I avoid looking at them and try my best to make an expressionless face. Being in a car with no tinted windows feels like it's too much exposure. It's the same thing when I go to outdoor places. When stepping out of my house and feel the sun on my skin, the thought of all my flaws from my face &amp; body being exposed come to mind and I hate that feeling. I feel so uncomfortable and so disgusting. \", \"Seeing people at parties. Im 18 now, I used to have social anxiety, but for the most part I have moved past it, but I still hate going to parties or large groups. When at work I'm around people who talk about drinking, partying, drugs, speeding, etc. And i see it all over their social media. I don't wish to be like them, but being around people who are like this make me feel like I'm not good enough, like somehow they are above me when they aren't. I've thought about this for a whole now and thought maybe asking how to help here could do something. One time they invited me to a bonfire and i had to leave because I felt horrible about all of it. I just don't know what to do about the situation and am hoping this is the right sub for it.\", ' Any other mom’s with social anxiety? How does it affect your day to day life with your kid(s)?. For me, my social anxiety has led to depression. Or maybe depression has led to social anxiety? I have days when I can handle more social situations than others. Other days I feel like a kid, hiding behind objects so people don’t see me. I’m *always* literally ALWAYS thinking about how others perceive me. Whenever I talk to someone, my immediate thought is “I wonder what they think of me?” I have issues with my body image too. My confidence level is incredibly low. I can barely look at myself in the mirror or in pictures because I find it makes everything worse. I already have super low self esteem as it is and seeing a picture of myself drops it down another level. So, I just don’t take pictures. If I do, they’re deleted right away. Having a 4 year old son on top of all of this is ridiculously hard. I feel bad for my kid most days because I just barely have the strength to play with him (depression) and the thought of doing things with people gives me anxiety (social anxiety). I’ve sucked it up a few times just so he could have a moment to play at the playground. When that happens, I’m usually forced to talk to other moms and it’s hard. So hard. Putting myself in those situations for my kid is hard. But especially hard for a mom with social anxiety. My son gets bored frequently. Some days he has too much screen time. It’s harder right now because of quarantine, but even in normal life we don’t get out much. I literally have NO friends. All I have is my son and my boyfriend, whom I’m thankful for, but even my boyfriend doesn’t have much of a social life himself. I feel like ghosts. Like, we as a family don’t exist. We’re invisible to a lot of people. Isolated. Nobody asks to see us except family from time to time. We don’t share too much on social media which keeps us in the dark even more. I stopped sharing on social media when I realized it was causing more harm to my anxiety and even my confidence. I went through a phase when sharing pictures of myself online was the only way I got a “confidence boost” and quickly realized it was eating away at my confidence more. So I stopped. People wonder about us because we’re so quiet. Even in high school I was a loner. Now, at 25, nothing’s really changed. At times, I can force myself to be OK in social situations and people probably would never know I was anxious - the only hint would be that I’m less outgoing than the group. I stay quiet unless I feel the need to say something. Talking exhausts me. Between depression, social anxiety, body dysmorphia, motherhood, etc I often feel very, very worthless. I hate feeling so down about life and myself, but I’ve kind of learned to keep going even when I do feel this way. It’s like, I don’t really know how to feel any different. I’m just at a loss with myself and who I am. I struggle to find my identity. I don’t know how people perceive me because I don’t know how to perceive myself. ', \"I did social work for one year. There were thousands of opportunities but not a single connexion was made. I even did a japanese language course but after I was sick for two weeks I was afraid to go there again. I even celebrated Men's day (that means drinking and hiking) with them but I was so lonely even amongst them so I broke out in tears...so Now you can imagine how fucked up I am \", ' I’m in therapy but so far it isn’t working, or maybe I just need to give it some more time. And I try to do activities to expand my horizons but they mostly end horribly after giving it a chance over and over but still getting the same outcome. Example being I joined a rowing team bc I needed to join a team, nobody there talked to me and I chickened out a lot and then now I’m the worst rower by far and I hate going to practice and even though I do it over and over again I still hate it.... ', ' I finally left the house today for the first time in over a week. And you know what? It didn\\'t help. I feel even worse now. It was just a reminder of how lonely I am. Usually when I go out somewhere I feel better. My SA/depression gets caught in a vicious cycle during extended periods of solitude where it feeds off itself, getting stronger and stronger everyday. But today, I broke that cycle and went out to run some errands, because I had to (seriously--I ran out of food). At first it was a reality check and a breath of fresh air. But then something HAD to come along and make me feel like shit again. Standing in the checkout line at the grocery store, I see this couple ahead of me. A guy, maybe my age, maybe a year or two older. Dressed kind of like me, except he wears it so much better. He even kind of looks like me, except better, and unlike me, he\\'s physically fit. Then this really cute girl runs up and joins him in line. Like, really hot. She\\'s all up next to him, talking close to him, and she clearly likes being with him. I had to turn my head and look away until they were gone. It felt like I was being punched in the face repeatedly, the world yelling out to me, over and over, \"HEY LOSER! REMEMBER HOW YOU\\'VE NEVER HAD A GIRLFRIEND AND HOW DEPRESSINGLY ALONE YOU ARE? WELL, HERE\\'S A REMINDER!\" Spend 3 weeks sitting at home, unemployed, hating myself, feeling worthless and hopeless, yet simultaneously numb, afraid to go outside, suicidal thoughts popping into my head every now and then throughout the day, then finally working up the courage to step outside and re-enter the world again, and I\\'m subjected to even more emotional torture--seeing other people happy. I can\\'t take anymore of it. I\\'m fucking done with this shit. Someone please kill me because I\\'m too much of a coward to do it myself. -Drunk rant finished- ', \" Friend is upset I don't want to go on a vacation with strangers.. Hello everyone! I'm sorry how long and more of a vent this will turn out to be. I have severe social anxiety (no, duh!) and have struggled with it most of my life. While I'm on medication that helps certain aspects, large groups and strangers still trigger my panic mood. So I have this friend....well sort of. It's not a close bond, but we once shared the same friend so we hung out and all. I became her back up bridesmaid after another dropped out (I didn't really want to, but feared saying no). Well she decided in July she wants to have a whole bridal party weekend getaway, this involves her, her fiance, her six bridesmaids (including myself), his six groomsmen, five SO of members of the bridal party and all their children. Just the idea has put me in full blown fear. My boyfriend said he would come with me, but now had to cancel due to work. I don't know any of these people, no less want to spend a weekend in a cabin with them all by myself. A part of me wants to suck it up and be there for her, but we all know how anxiety works. I don't want to have a breakdown around them. I also don't want to spend three hundred dollars on a trip I'm going to dread. It's just all of them are rather close, where I feel like I'm more default and will be on the outside. I feel selfish. Now my friend is angry at me and reconsidering me being in her wedding party. Apparently she needs people who are involved and willing to suck up their issues - I've explained my anxiety to her and the reply is always, learn how to deal with it. Any advice? \", \" My dreaded time of the year... Summer. How does one have fun in the summer when you have no friends? This time every year I find myself getting so depressed because I want to have fun and do summer things, but I'm completely alone and have no one to do anything with.

It definitely hurts when I see other people my age outside having fun and making memories with people. Anyone else in the same boat? How do you deal with the summertime blues? \", ' Could it be that i never noticed i had social anxiety, or is it just a temporary phase that\\'ll go away once i figure what i want to do in life career wize?. i\\'ve never been a huge social person, but i\\'ve always had my 3-4 group of friends at each school i went to. i think primary school was the only place i didn\\'t have friends for one year, but even then, i never felt like i cared. i didn\\'t like group project but i didn\\'t mind them because i usually did them with a friend, and while i was of course nervous in front of people, i didn\\'t feel overwhelmed. i also didn\\'t feel overwhelmed when i had to present something at the board by myself, i didn\\'t like it but i forced myself and it went okay you know. i never spoke up in class unless needed. all my teachers said it, \"too calm\" \"doesn\\'t participate\" but because i don\\'t talk unless i have something to say. &amp;#x200B; i never knew what i wanted to do career wise, never. but i also didn\\'t ask myself much. i made jokes and appeared chill, which alot of people told me. it was the whole vibe i gave, and i felt like it too, meaning i didn\\'t feel stressed or anxious much. only time i felt somewhat stressed were for first days of schools, when i moved somewhere else, nervously hoping i would make friend, that i wouldn\\'t get lost, but it feels like it\\'s just common stress you know. After high school, i went to uni because all my friends did and i was good in english so i figured why not. ended up not being my thing. i failed. that\\'s not when the stress started. i then applied to psychology at uni and to a PA course. i didn\\'t even know it was for PA but the diploma seemed pretty basic and quick (2 years), so i went for this one, even though i had psychology in the back of my head for years, because i got scared of how long psychology was. i got scared i wouldn\\'t be good at it. i got scared i wouldn\\'t get good grades. i had to do 3 short interships for the PA course, and i felt anxious through all of them but i managed. i hate calling and answering phone calls but i had to do it for most of my interships and i managed. mostly because i could pass them to employees who knew the answers to the questions asked. but i wasn\\'t very social, and i\\'ve been told so. i didn\\'t really go out of my way to talk to the employees. when i finished the PA course and got my diploma. i realized along the way it wasn\\'t my thing either. i don\\'t want to be a PA. and that\\'s when the stress started. i got a small part time job because i know myself and, having not worked alot, i knew i had to go slowly. i did. but it was a job at a pizza place and it also made me realize i have no freaking idea what i want to do. and EVEN if i did, i\\'m so freaked out now, having spent so much time at home with my mind, that i would be scared as hell to go for it. &amp;#x200B; my dog died after my diploma, and he was my best friend, i know everyone says this, but as someone who didn\\'t have REAL friends beside one who stayed, he really was. i was 7 when we adopted him, he died when i was 23. he was my shadow in a funny way, wouldn\\'t leave my side, and i don\\'t know if this is related. i never kept much contact with all the people i met in schools, only one friend or so. and i don\\'t know if the way i\\'ve felt scared of the future, scared of jobs, scared of everything, came because of my dog\\'s death as a way to mourn, or if it\\'s deeper than that. i don\\'t know if it\\'s covid, because i don\\'t feel like i feel anxious about covid, living in a small village, but then maybe i don\\'t see how anxious it makes me. and i don\\'t know if it\\'s just not knowing what i want to do in life. or if it\\'s all of them. i should be focusing on my driving license but yet i can\\'t. it goes to the point where i cry at night quietly so my sister don\\'t hear through the wall. my heart races fast most of the time, my feet fidget most of the time, i\\'m constantly thinking about career, career, career. but i\\'m incapable, or i feel so at least, of doing anything. i feel like i\\'m scared of going out of my comfort zone, of meeting people, of going outside, of having responsabilities when i feel SO immature. i don\\'t want a job, but i have to no? i remember having a fear of my parents dying at something like 11 years old. but it passed and i got over it, yet right now it\\'s back again but it\\'s worse because i\\'m older and they\\'re older and i haven\\'t figured shit out yet. When my mom took me to soccer, tennis, basketball and all that; i had no problem with it. but now that i had the idea of starting soccer again, i felt so scared and anxious of calling by myself like an adult that i just didn\\'t do it? i wanted to learn piano recently, never called. i got so anxious when i got phone calls for jobs, or for interviews, i literally had to write what i was gonna say on my phone? i never cared about phones calls younger, so why? when i started the PA course, i didn\\'t freak out THIS much at the aspect of going to a new school in a place i knew nothing about, so why didn\\'t i go for psychology this year because i got scared of going back to school again? it\\'s just so frustrating. i guess i\\'m posting again here, because i don\\'t know who else to tell. what if i\\'m just making up those feelings all in my head? what if i\\'m just being a crybaby when so many people have it worse. i know we shouldn\\'t compare, but i feel like \"what if i\\'m overexagerating my feelings and i\\'m not actually anxious/nervous but i made it all up in my head and convinced myself i was while some people actually suffer from it?\" i FEEL anxious, i FEEL incapable or having responsabilities, immature, i feel scared. but am i? i don\\'t know, i don\\'t wanna bother anyone. ', \"If your mom gets mad at you for trying to talk about your problems I'd try and take a different approach to telling her. The best thing you can do is try and stay calm even if she gets mad at you. Try and approach her when she's in a good mood. You can even do something for her (such as making her coffee) to try and create a good atmosphere before you talk to her. Do your best to open up to her as much as you can. I don't know anything about you, but a few years ago I'd never have imagined telling my mum about my problems in detail. Maybe you feel this way too, maybe it seems impossible, but once it's done it is worth it. Go into detail and tell her how you feel about it. If she has empathy she will listen and try to understand your point of view.  Now i know everybodys gonna say your still young its normal for you to be like this... As someone a few years older than you, I found out around your age that everyone has their own problems they deal with. I didn't believe it at the time; it took me a while to realise it but everyone has their own unique problems and their confidence is all an act.  while potheads, sex addicts and bullies and all this shit get to live the fun, free life without worry of what tbey do next The majority of people who lead this sort of life will end up regretting it in the long run. Most of these sorts of people I knew at 15/16 ended up with a low paid/no job at 18 and no skills and no ambition to make a change. You're at the point of your life where you can focus on your future. Change doesn't happen overnight, not even in a week, not in a month, heck you'd be lucky to change your life around in a year. But at your age you have a massive opportunity. Focus on your future. Think about what you want to achieve, what kind of lifestyle you want to lead. Be realistic, but be ambitious. Some of your problems will follow you for many months or many years but you need to have a drive to overcome them. Your best option would be to think about what you want to do in the future and how you can work towards it in the next year. Do you want to continue school? Then probably consider moving schools once the academic year is finished. Think about apprentiship/training schemes or college courses you might want to do, or think about a job you want to get. Focus on something you know you enjoy.  This is because i always feel like i walk weird, Have a very asymetrical face (ugly), underdeveloped jaw, i run weird my whole body just doesnt look right. i have confidence in my body i had a workout addiction i just dont think its all in proportion, im scared to do stuff because it just doesnt ever look right when i do it. Im always judging myself probably a habit im just not used to going days without torment. Pretend you're an actor. I don't mean that you should try to change the way you look or to try and do everything perfectly, but put yourself in the mindset of an actor. Your new role is to play a confident, good looking guy who knows he looks great and will be a great person. When you have a negative thought about yourself, go into acting mode and pretend you're the guy everyone likes and wants to be. If you're looking in the mirror and don't like what you see, change the scene. Change the lighting in the room, the angle you're facing or the distance you are from the mirror until you think 'maybe I don't look too bad'. Because you don't look at someone else and study them up close for hours on end and find all of their flaws. Other people look at you from a distance and don't see your flaws, just like you don't notice all of theirs. Believe me the reason you look at yourself and think that you're ugly is psychological and if you start acting the role of the guy you want to be, you will realise that you're actually not too far off.\", \" I wish I could enjoy going outside but I tend to feel all spaced out because of the anxiety, even when walking alone.

All they talk about is this and I just can’t relate. And it’s not that I don’t want to experience these things as well, it’s just my social anxiety that prevents me from having these experiences.

I am also underweight and constantly lose a lot of weight because of the stress from the anxiety and because I cant eat and lose my appetite when I’m anxious, which is too often. I also have high blood pressure as a result of my anxiety as well. It has caused me to miss out on many opportunities, and meeting new people The social affects the anxiety has had on me has ruined my school experience so far, and made me very reclusive and not able to make friends or hang out at parties and having a normal school life and pretty much alienated me. Not being able to talk to people and having near constant panic attacks has also negatively effected my academics and sometimes I can’t even go to class because the panic attack i get before is so bad, or i have a panic attack in class and have to leave and miss the whole lecture or whatever we are doing. I wouldn’t say i have been able to manage it so far, because i cant live a normal fulfilling life or make new friends or get a job, but i have been able to reduce the severity of attacks by doing certain breathing exercises and listening to music. I decided when i got to college, enough was enough and i didn’t wanna just keep barely scraping by with my anxiety anymore and i sought help from the campus therapist who said she thought i should try medication and recommended me to the nurse practitioner who prescribed me Lexapro. I took it for a few weeks and it didn’t help at all with my anxiety and had some unpleasant side effects, i told the nurse practitioner and she upped the dose but it still doesn’t help at all, and my grades are suffering really badly from missing class because of my anxiety so i was desperate for a solution so i started “self medicating” by smoking cigarettes to cope with the panic attacks and anxiety, which i know aren’t good for you (my grandparents died from smoking and many people in my family have complications like emphazima from it) and are very addicting but its more effective than anything else and I couldn’t afford to miss anymore class.

For the last couple of years, I have been trying to deal with it independently through herbal supplements like L-theanine and Valerian Root, but still find myself overwhelmed with anxiety in most social situations to the point where I \"black out\" - people tell me that I\\'m talking coherently and sound cool, calm, and collected, but when I think back on that situation, I can\\'t remember how I spoke, what my audience\\'s attention level was, or even most of what I said. nnThis blackout mental state applies to social parties where I dont know many people, times of conflict between friends and coworkers, and any sort of public speaking capacity. I\\'m a wildlife biologist and have some meetings coming up of statewide importance where I\\'ll be presenting several proposed regulatory changes to hunting regulations. Obviously, I cant afford to risk my social anxiety affecting my performance and reputation at these public meetings. Moreover, in my anxiety overridden mind, I dont have the mental clarity to convey facts and what\\'s germane to the conversation well and am always kicking myself post-presentation for important points I meant to say but didn\\'t.nnSo, I\\'m finally throwing in the towel on thinking I can \"beat\" my social anxiety and am going to pursue some kind of anxiety medication to help me. I hate to admit it, but I need help. I\\'m a little freaked out by medications for mental illnesses - my twin sister has been on them for several years and I dont even recognize her anymore. nnAny folks out there with social anxiety that can share their experiences with different medications and what worked and didnt work for them, side effects, etc? I\\'m considering pursuing the Benzodiazepine route initially. Seems like that would help me avoid a long-term dependence on medications that I have to be on daily.nnThanks in advance for your information, guys.', \" I am doing an exchange year but my social anxiety is making my mental health here pretty bad and I kind of regret my decision.... Hi:) Ok, so this is probably gonna be a very long post.. sorry about that. So I (16F) am from Germany but I am currently doing an exchange year in Texas and going to a high school here. I've always struggled with social anxiety and it has always made my life a little bit harder. But overall and especially since acknowledging it I was able to get along with it fine. And although I struggled with my friends situation in Germany too, I was at a point where I was pretty comfortable. I had 3 close friends (although 1 maybe not as much anymore and I only very regularly met up with one of them), I felt comfortable in school and in my class since I had been in the same class with the same people for 5 years, I had a good relationship with my parents and siblings (although looking back now I definitely didn’t appreciate and acknowledge them enough) and I was just overall doing ok I guess. So I always wanted to do an exchange year and decided to actually do it and go to school in the US for 10 months. I was really excited about it and thought going specifically to the US would help me get more open and overcome my social anxiety since the people here are known for being very open. I thought about it a lot and imagined how my life here would be. Everyone I ever heard of told me that doing an exchange year was the best decision and one if not the best year of their lives. So I felt encouraged and I felt confident I could do it. I knew that this would be a very big challenge for my social anxiety but since my English was already very good and I was basically already fluent I decided that would make it one challenge less and I would be able to jump over my shadow and do this. Well I have been here for 3 months now and it is just so much harder than I ever could have imagined, I cry myself to sleep a lot and my mental health overall and my social anxiety is just much worse than it was at home. I live in a host family here and I do get along with them pretty well in general and besides the fact that living with a family you never knew before, of course, is very weird I would say I have gotten used to living here, and rather comfortable. The only thing giving me a lot of issues here are the kids. The little girl is just not respecting my boundaries at all and tries to hug me every time she gets the chance to, even though and because she knows that I do not like hugs and they make me uncomfortable. That's just one thing but I'm not really gonna get into the other reasons here. So as I said I am a senior at a high school here. So as you might imagine I don't really have any friends. The only friend group that I have here are the other exchange students but that is just a little bit different because we're going through the same thing of course and I didn't really have to do anything myself to get these friends yk and a lot actually like went through my host sister (I have a double placement which means There is another exchange student living in my house and without her I probably would not survive this here at all (the kids and just everything in general). I don't really have any classes with them though besides one class I have with my host sister. In this class, we have 2 „friends“ but as you might imagine I wasn't the one that like initiated that and we don't meet them like outside of school. I don't have any friends in any of my other classes because I am just mentally (it feels like it's physically) not able to take the first step and start talking to people and then keeping it going. Before coming here I kind of thought everyone would know I'm not from here and be interested in talking to me, which is pretty naive to think but that's what I heard from some former exchange students. Well, my school here is huge (2770 students, for comparison my german school roughly has 600) and no one is interested in talking to me. And if they are then they ask like 2 questions and then they're not interested anymore. And I guess my accent also is not strong enough for people to know I'm not from here. Also, they are probably used to people not speaking perfect English since we have a lot of students coming from Mexico at my school that only speak Spanish and a little bit of English. Our school has A and B days and 4 classes per day. A day is the day where I have forensic science with my host sister which makes it an ok day but still in the other classes I pretty much just quietly does my work alone. Well, B-day is way worse… I quietly do my work the whole day since I don't have any friends or people talking to me on that day. I also have my less favorite classes on B-day. So I just kind of exist and get through with these school days but I never really have fun in school. And I mean I came here to experience the American high school so It makes me feel so bad and guilty and like I'm wasting time and I'm just not really happy in school here. Most exchange students say to join a club or a sport and that that will make it very easy to find friends, so since I already played a little bit of soccer in Germany I joined the soccer team. Sadly that didn't help me either and it just kind of feels a little awkward a lot of the time. This whole thing is just being really bad for my mental health, I cry a looot here and I'm just not really that happy here and I just want to be home so often. I have friends that are doing an exchange year as well and seeing all their stories and talking to them and hearing about how happy they are here and how ist the best year of their lives and they don't want to leave and just only see them having like a lot of friends just hurts e a lot and makes me feel so bad. I've already unfollowed every exchange student I am not personally friends with but it is still very hard. One of my best friends (the one I meet more often) is doing an exchange year as well and she is the only one I ever really open up to about my social anxiety since she also has an anxiety disorder and can relate a lot better and I don't know why but she is just the only one I feel comfortable talking to about my struggles. So for her ist pretty much the opposite and her mental health got so much better being here and hearing from her just hurts so much too. And she tries to help me but I just feel like right now I have no one that can relate to me and really understand me and I'm just t not really a person that opens up easily which means I'm not really comfortable opening up to anyone. And now my birthday is in like 2 weeks and I just don't know how I'm supposed to be able to feel happy on my birthday in this situation when it's gonna be my first birthday ever without my family and also without my twin sister who is doing an exchange year as well (which makes me compare mine to hers as well too of course and it's really hard to see her be so happy too). And of course, I'm happy for all my friends and that they are having such an amazing time but I am just not and that makes it so difficult for me to feel happy for them. I just don't know what to do anymore and how I'm supposed to make it through the next 7 months. And don't get me wrong of course there are still happy moments here like when I'm hanging out with the other exchange students but otherwise I just kind of regret my exchange year a little bit. And also every you do have a Local coordinator from the agency that is supposed to talk to you regularly and just help you with things but mine is just not that present. Technically she is supposed to talk to us like once every 2 weeks and meet us at least once a month but I have only seen and talked to my local coordinator once for like 10 minutes after the first month. She was also supposed to give us an orientation where she goes over rules advice etc when we got here but she never did that either. So although she does seem like a nice person she's just so busy with her own family and her job she doesn't really do her job as a local coordinator that well and it just doesn't make me comfortable enough to talk to her about this. Sorry, this was so long but I just kind of needed to rant about this and let it all out somewhere, and maybe one of you has some advice for me… \", ' Mission: make friends, failed once again.. Hey guys, just a little introduction: I\\'m 20, generally introverted and quiet, I\\'ve been pretty much friendless for 3/4 of my life, except early elementary school, but I\\'m not sure if I can even count that as \"friends\", they were just acquaintances from the same street and we\\'d rike bikes and play games together. There was a japanese culture convention in my city today. I thought that was a great opportunity to make friends and maybe even get a girlfriend - after all, they are most likely sharing the same interests as me and are quiet, introverted, et cetera. So I decided to go. I was obviously stressed at the idea, but I still did it. At first it was kinda nice: they gave me an ID with an orange color meaning that I want people to approach me and talk with me. I went to the first room, there was an integration class going on, we all sat in a circle, they were introducing themselves. I couldn\\'t recognize any anime they were talking about, though, and it was all slow so I walked out before the end and checked out the \"store\" with all kinds of merchandise. Then I went to many different rooms with all kind of people. Lectures, dancing games, etc. All that time I was a ball of stress. My self-esteem is so low that it\\'s funny. I was telling myself: relax, everything\\'s alright, but my body was thinking different. In five hours, I was just walking alone from room to room, playing retro games, looking at the same merchandise all over again (I bought two haruhi suzumiya and totoro related gadgets), drank one tea or sitting in the hallway on my phone. Everytime I saw a girl - and believe me, they were so beautiful and in cosplay - I had no idea what to do with myself. I tried to talk with them, but I failed. I approached two girls and started talking with them, but some other guy came by, said something and they forgot about me and focused on him. I had a conversation with only one girl - a cosplayer - because I missed her lecture - we talked a bit, she was extremely nice. But then I we kind of parted our ways. She was with her friends anyways. I just came home and I\\'m not even sure how to feel about all that. By now, everyone had pairs or groups of some kind, all talking with eachother. Now I\\'m not even sure what to do. It\\'s another time that I failed at making friends. I don\\'t care about lots of friends, I just want one, or a girlfriend, just to spend time nice together. It\\'s sooo difficult though. Thanks for reading, anyways. ', \"Getting a drivings license.

I'm 17 F from the Netherlands\", \" I can relate so freaking much to this. My life also went downhill ever since the end of 12th grade. First years in college sucked bad (I failed in them, now an official drop-out but making a granted comeback and actually things going well for the first time in 2 years) just when I though college would save me from this empty loop I've dropped into when I hit 18. On a brighter aspect, now, as a 20 year old freshman, I'm getting my shit together finally. Just at this phase I have figured out my hobbies (from Guitar playing to Tennis to Programming) and what my actual cons and pros are. How? Well currently my social anxiety (and subsequently, my mild depression) has been on its lowest levels since 2014 and I guess it is thanks to the gym, sticking to a healthy lifestyle (stable sleeping cycle, healthy food, excercising), and overcoming some bad habits of mine just because i GENUINELY wished I could stop them (e.x: biting nails, have had it since 2 years old). So yeah, I'd recommend those steps to anyone in our case. They surely have some amazing effects on us. Key is don't stress yourself over it, they're not that easy but are definitely approachable. Baby steps. Performing every day slightly better than its previous. Things like that that get to your unconsciousness, rip off the negative thoughts, and embrace the good ones about yourself and the world around you. It's all about loving yourself and your life first, so opening up and feeling loved by others won't be that big of a deal anymore; both things coming naturally.

Hope your twenties may be full of joy, adventures and love :) \", \" Does anyone else feel like who they are and what they do is directly linked to what you think the people around you think of you?. As stated in the title, I feel like my personality and my abilities are what I think the people around me think they are. For example I grew up skateboarding and snowboarding a lot. I was pretty decent, if I skated in front of someone who had seen me skate well before, I would skate well. Now if I skated in front of someone who didn't know I skateboarded (therefore would be judging me) or someone who I for some reason thought that they wouldn't think I was good, I would skate terribly. Its the same way with anxiety symptoms, once I blush in front of someone, every time I see them i feel like they are expecting it, and it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. In a way its like I literally have no self confidence, any confidence that I have is based on how I perceive what the people around me think of me. Does anyone else feel like this? \", ' Occasionally, weirdly tends to happen in moments that are supposed to be happy. (ex.

I don\\'t know if this belongs here, I mean I think it does. I have severe social anxiety and I am really anxious right now. I am at my grandfather\\'s farm and we live on a road where there aren\\'t a lot of people, or shouldn\\'t be. It is near a few small towns however. I have been doing well with my social anxiety, until right now. I know I shouldn\\'t be bothered by one bad person, but now I don\\'t know if I should trust people anymore. My grandpa has a few dogs, boxers and they might jump but they are quite gentle. I am outside looking around when I hear someone shouting, which scares me. There is this lady on a bike. She yells at me \"Get your dogs away!\" Keep in mind the dogs are not near her, and are just on the driveway, they only go over when she starts yelling. I try to get them away, but she keeps yelling at me which makes me shake because it is terrifying me. I say \"Well maybe people shouldn\\'t bike on this road.\" She than says \"I shouldn\\'t ride my bike here!?\" I mean this isn\\'t where she lives, so I don\\'t get her logic, anyone who lives on that road knows there are lots of animals, not just on my grandpas farm but other peoples too. I see her ride off and I just run into the house crying and feel this feeling of terror that I can\\'t even feel in a nightmare. I have been diagnosed with social anxiety because I couldn\\'t go to school. Last year my mother almost hit someones car and the lady went off on her, which made me terrified of cars. I can\\'t easily go to my own town anymore because of that. I don\\'t feel safe where I have felt safe for years. I am scared of her, of other people. Also a car stopped while I was trying to get the dogs off the road, and the man starts laughing at me. I\\'m scared, I don\\'t want her to hurt my dogs or me or my grandpa. I phoned my aunt when I was about to have a panic attack, I felt one coming and she talked to me for a while. I am sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, but I am really scared. I don\\'t feel like I can handle life, I am already a failure. I\\'m only 14 but I am really hurt, I am sorry for bothering anyone but I don\\'t know what to do.

When I was in high school, I realized that I was always the one who pursued friendships, and that all of the people I hung out with didn’t seem to reciprocate our friendship. Looking back, it was upsetting to me that it seemed to me that no one actually wanted to be my friend, they just would be if it was convenient. So, basically, when I was 16, I stopped inviting my friends to do things, telling myself that if they cared about me, they would invite me to do things with them. I still had some normal social stuff in high school...a senior camping trip, a group to go to dinner with before prom...but pretty much all of my close friendships ended. Most of them were good riddance...a lot of my “friends” has blatantly bullied me in middle school anyway. I’ve realized that this is a huge part of why I’m now 25 and terrible and social interactions. I let that mindset bleed into potential friendships in college and now as an adult too. There are tons of perfectly wonderful people I associated with in college, but very few that I was “close” with and none who I talk to now, mostly because I can’t let myself open up and be myself. Basically the only person who I consider to truly be my “friend” now is my fiancé, who I live with. I struggle to even participate in conversations because I’m so self conscious, to the point where my future brother in law’s girlfriend thinks I don’t like her. I only talk openly or show any personality when I’ve had a drink or two, and then I’m just as likely to embarrass myself because I’m either tipsy or I just say shit that doesn’t come out right because I’m not good at talking to people. I’ve been thinking about how I got to be this way for a while because I’m unhappy with the fact that I don’t have friends and wanted to share this with people who might relate. Thanks.', \" I've been socially anxious for so long that I don't even know what to say and what to do when I actually go outside and interact with people. Example - I've been considering going to the gym, but the problem is that not only does the idea of exercising in front of strangers terrify me, what also scares me is that I don't know exactly how to get in that situation. Like, when I enter the gym - where do I go first? Is there a receptionist or do I have to look for someone elsewhere? If there is one, how do I ask them that I want to use their gym? Like which exact words do I say? I have no idea. Is there something expected of me to bring with me? Will they point me to where I have to go or will I have to figure it out by myself? What exactly do I do next? etc. It's just a stream of question and uncertainties. A million chances to make a fool of myself. A million if chances to misspeak, look confused, have my voice crack, do something incorrectly and embarrass myself in general. I wish there was a set of instructions on the internet for everything I could follow and make sure I'm doing things the way others find acceptable. Like a screenplay. Everything is so fucking complicated. Every place is completely different. The type of people you'll meet will be completely random. You can't prepare yourself and it's terrifying. You know what pisses me off the most? Humanity has been around for thousands of years and we still haven't managed to create a world where life is simple and easy. It's safe to say I hate all of my ancestors for failing at this. (BTW this is just an example to show you what goes through my head in these situations, I don't want answers to those questions because I don't need them in English.) \", ' Social anxiety is hindering my weight loss. I have an extremely sedentary lifestyle. I am not obese but pretty fat. I have been thinking about how to motivate myself to do some exercise and I realized that I always avoided it because I hated every second. But I do remember enjoying bike riding when I was a kid. So I watched some youtube videos about bikes and found a video where a guy is testing mountain bikes on some rural bike paths and it looked like soooo much fun. I wanted to do it immediately but I quickly realized that it would not turn out the way I imagined it. He was alone there, I would probably be unlucky enough to arrive at a time the place was full of teenagers who would make fun of me. I would love to buy a bike and just ride on rural paths but it will never happen because the embarrassment would kill me. Just the idea of someone seeing me cycling is so cringe.

How do you join a group that * is not advertised anywhere * doesn\\'t have any official physical place for meetups * is not meant to be joinable by strangers Most people who hang out in groups have their own close-friend-only groups that communicate on private channels.

So I can’t provide much context as this happened about 9 months ago. I’m sharing this because I’m proud of myself for it and don’t really have anyone else to share it with. I was in a toxic friendship with these two guys and my therapist knew it. He helped coach me out of the friendship after this event. Anyway, my two friends and I were hanging out at a park. One of the friends, we’ll call him joe, was trying to be some controlling alpha leader of us at the time. My self esteem was too low to do anything about it until this day. He was being his usual annoying and controlling self and I decided “fuck it”. I start walking in front of him leading us back to the car and he gets pissed. “Oh wow slowerthan is leading us. Now we’re gonna get lost”. Now I could see I was right about him wanting to be some alpha male leader. I ignored his comment and kept walking. He began projecting at me “slowerthan’s so mad! He’s so mad right now!” I wasn’t mad I was very happy with myself and kept ignoring him. He then takes some awkwardly angled photo of me and says “I’m gonna post it! I’m gonna post it!” I smile at him and say “post it!” He doesn’t. He says “I want ice cream”. Bear in mind that our other friend, we’ll call him mike, wanted to go home and we had already agreed on this earlier. Also keep in mind that joe always has to do what he wants and ignores other people’s objections, including driving recklessly on the highway. I immediately respond, “we can go through a drive thru and get ice cream on the way back.” He objects, expectedly. I say “it’s a compromise it’s what adults do”. He finally shut up for the day. Later, he blew up on me over text sending paragraph after paragraph attacking my insecurities and what not. I ended up hanging out with him some time later and he acted overly nice to me out of fear. I know he was afraid because while we were driving in a car, after he blew up on me over text, he accidentally touched my arm with his arm on the center console and physically jumped. Currently I am very distant from him. Stand up for yourself, especially if someone is toxic and worsens your mental health. Thanks for reading.

AGH IM SUPER PROUD OF MYSELF FOR THIS My sister(20F), her friend(20M), and I (16F) went riding around our state just enjoying being out of the house. We were parked on top of a mountain looking over a city when a Blue Tesla suddenly parked next to us. We saw it before when we were driving around the mountain but we never saw the owner and my sister was saying how much she loved the car. I joked around and said “One of us should just go up and say ‘hey I like your car’” my sister took that as a chance to annoy me and started teasing me saying I should do it and that I would never. Me being the annoying little sibling took that as a challenge so I put on my mask and got out of the car (not going to lie I was walking back and forth between our two cars for ten minutes because I just realized what I got myself into). My sister was recording as her and her friend were laughing so then I finally did it I walked up to the car and saw this really beautiful lady in the drivers side. I knocked on the window and said “hey my friends and I thought u had a really cool car and I also think you’re really cute and cool so uh yeah” (I get word vomit when trying to initiate a conversation which I rarely do). Turns out the lady actually WORKED for Tesla so she offered all three of us a little joy ride up and down the mountain, we even got to see some really cool stuff like how they have a “romance” setting where it shows a fireplace on the screen and the AC suddenly turns to heat as ur seat starts to warm up. It was just like sitting next to a fire! THEY ALSO HAD A WHOOPIE CUSHION SETTING THAT U COULD PASS AROUND TO EACH SEAT AND CHANGE WHAT FART SOUND COMES OUT OF IT. It was super cool and since I was the one who went up to her I got to ride in the front seat which I NEVER get to do because of my sisters friends and stuff. We said we wouldn’t tell our parents (partly because we went from 0-60 MPH in 3 seconds and one simple turn of the wheel we would’ve literally fallen off of the mountain) but honestly this is such a big accomplishment for me! I mean I still to this day can’t order food for myself I tell my family what I want and they do it for me so the fact that I went up to her and then got to ride in a freaking TESLA is so so big for me!!

I don't know where I picked up the habit from, but I used to do it at school for a very short time. Eventually a teacher had called me into her office during recess. One of my friends had come to the playground to tell me that she wanted to see me. I was shitting bricks because I had no idea what I had done wrong. The teacher told me to take a seat and then talked about my skirt pulling habit. She asked me where I picked up that habit from and then told me that it was a very '' dirty '' thing to do. Now you might say that I was just 5 years old and I must have imagined this but......that was the first time in my life where I felt like I was being attacked because of my gender. There was a lot of in-between-the-lines stuff and judgemental overtones in the way she was talking to me and looking at me. She didn't simply say that it was a rude thing to do to pull people's clothes.....she implied that I was '' dirty '' for engaging in that behavior and treating girls specifically like that. I think its messed up to gender police little children like that and treat them like they're something that they're not. But I think its because we are living in an increasingly gynocentric society that doesn't care about boys or their feelings. Anyways just wanted to share this here. I think incidents like this can have a detrimental effect on the self esteem of boys and make them feel out of place. \", ' I (25F anxious blob) going to ask a great skater out for an ice skating date! Wish me luck + anxiety management tips! :). It’s been so cold (close to -30 degrees) and all I’ve been doing with my person (35M, also anxious blob) have been cooking dinner together and watching TV. The weather is going to be better this weekend and I’ve been thinking of finally going ice skating with him. He basically grew up on ice and plays hockey. I have ice skated at most five times in my life and every single time, I can at best penguin waddle and have to hold onto someone’s hands. He asked me if I wanted to ice skate together on our second date back in early December but because I am super anxious that I’d make a fool out of myself in front of him and everyone else (there was no lockdown back then), I opted for a walk instead. Now that there’s a very empty and covid safe rink around our houses, I’m tempted to try again. I’m excited at the idea but super embarrassed that I still can’t even stand alone on ice. Basically, how do I let my guards down a little bit and have fun doing this without stressing too much? Do people find dates unattractive if they are not good at an outdoor activity? Because of my social anxiety, I don’t do things I’m not good at at all but I’d like to try things with this person. I’ve found myself wanting to ice skate with him a few times by now but had always stopped myself from asking him because I’m scared of coming off unattractive. Any tips/words of encouragement appreciated! Thank you. 😊 TLDR: Socially anxious bad ice skater wants to try the rink with a really good hockey player. How do I make this happen without backing out like before or without stressing too much? ', ' Intense feeling of humiliation made me introverted. I was socialising before that, I was extrovert, now I am Recluse-Extrovert.. It is all connected to pride. I figured it all along. First time I didn\\'t manage to defend my Pride was when a bigger boy tried to bully me when I was 10-11 year old. Second time was when some boys that I played football(soccer) with, said that I was really amazing at it, but made fun of my skinny figure, I was small for my age, even now. They said: You are good but you cannot be bigger age than us... And asked me to recite the multiplication table, I got tense and made some wrong answers. I can still remember after so many years their reaction, and the reaction of my friends that played with us: \\'\\'I don\\'t know guys hes grandmother told us that he is an A student\\'\\'...and I was, that\\'s true. I was because I wanted to please my parents. Not for myself. Pride is the mother of Social Anxiety for me. Third time was in High school I was skinny and short, still am and some of the boys tried to bully me to make themselves feel better... I fought back but they were more so I stopped talking to them - again my Pride received another blow. I felt humiliated. Became recluse: playing games, staying all day in my room. That was in 2006- 7th grade (Last time I was \"shot in the heart\") - so I became a recluse. Now I go to University - but I don\\'t socialise at all. Protecting my Pride from the outside world. Also my overbearing parents contributed because: \\'They always told me: \\'To act kindly to all people, no matter bad or good. Because the bad can make me suffer.\\'\\' Well I did that, and look what happened. Bad people will try to run over you. If they sense you are weak, survival of the fittest, we are not animals but in socializing we are to some degree. TLDR: Too much Dignity, Honour at the heart of all Social Anxiety. ', ' Not your fault. It is all on her her. She\\'s rude. Reminds me of my 5 year old son. We were at the playground and he was having a meltdown because I was not letting him do something ridiculous, like climb on the canopies over the playground equipment, when a little boy kept following him around because he wanted to play. My son just stopped and SCREAMED \"STOP FOLLOWING ME!\" Other little boy burst into tears and ran to his mother. He was like 3 or 4. Poor kid. What I\\'m saying is this work acquaintance acts like a borderline toddler with no impulse control. So don\\'t worry about it. She\\'s a crazy bitch. She should beyond that phase of emotional development by now. ', \" This was me 100%. My first year of high school was spent doing this until I realised in 10th grade that it wasn't obligatory to go to the cafeteria during lunch. After that, I just spent my days either in the library pretending to do homework, at random spots pretending to make phone calls, and hidden behind a tree or under the bleachers. \", ' Missing out, feeling like no one relates. I’m a junior (11th) in highschool, and I’m sad highschool is nearing an end for me. In 6th grade I was essentially bullied, which turn me into a mute hermit basically. I literally do not speak until I’m spoken too, I only have 2 somewhat distant friends and miraculously a boyfriend. I never went out, I never had close friends, I was on a soccer team but I was literally mute. When I read stories from other people online, who were in a similar situation they always seem to pull themselves out of it, or the highschool and middle school loners I hear about were just loners because they wanted to be rather than because they had anxiety and couldn’t pull themselves out of it. I hope that makes sense. I want to be social, I want to have friends, but I can’t. I have the fear of people over hearing my conversations, so I don’t speak in public. Every time I leave a social interact I’m embarrassed or I feel like I was being “fake”. I’m embarrassed by my own thoughts, and I’m deeply sad I never experienced “teen things”, i can’t relate to the rebellious teen. I already have OCD, and I regret something so deeply that I’ve done in my past. I used to plan using drugs or something like that to get out there and be social like I so strongly wished. But I know that would do more harm than good, and yes that’s a thought I’m embarrassed about. I did things out of loneliness I regret so much. At times, I’m so ashamed of who I am. I feel like I’m in a pit and there’s no way to climb out of it. The OCD makes my romantic relationship horrifying, to the point where I wake up everyday with anxiety in my gut. I only ever spend time with my boyfriend or my parents and that’s the extent of my social life. I want things to change so badly, I hope to join this small show choir next year and I hope that will turn some thing around. Hopefully in college I can make some friends. But here’s the thing: my window of friendship, I feel, is closing in on me. I feel like once I’m in my mid-20s the opportunity for a friendship like the ones you find in highschool will be completely gone. You know how kids and marriages get in the way of being with friends. I imagine a miserable future where I’m back to the situation I’m in now, just the parent instead of the child. I hope that makes sense. I hope I could actively achieve friendship when I’m older, if I strive for it. Other wise, I’m lost, helpless, riddled with a million other problems also. ', ' So I was at the beach....

I had some friends in high school but I probably wouldn’t have if they weren’t my baseball teammates. Once college started everyone went their separate ways and I haven’t seen any of them in person since graduation. I was friends with two of my roommates freshman year but they both transferred and it’s been impossible to make friends since then. I’m starting my senior year next month and I’m not expecting much to change, although I’d give anything to be able to enjoy my last year of college. ', ' College Life and stuff idk it\\'s a story.... I\\'m a freshman at college and it\\'s the hardest thing I have ever done, I\\'m not gonna lie I don\\'t regret it and I really like it but this is really making me fight myself a lot. I have always had severe anxiety and it caused a 2 year long depression too (18 Male). I was raised in a very small town in a very small school, 30 people in my class and we were considered big. I am going to a college that is Little over 15 minutes away from my family. Everyone and their mothers told me to get a dorm and I did which I thought would be like the most anxiety testing thing I ever do, it wasn\\'t. Mainly because unlike other dorms I had a room to myself but I share a living room, it\\'s like an apartment but smaller. My room mate is a guy who goes to my same counselor but he has aspurgers so he says a lot of things that really mess with me and it takes me a while to convince myself that he didn\\'t mean it, don\\'t comment explaining how he did mean it or anything... it\\'s how I cope with not freaking out on a daily basic. My first fear was of friends. How do I meet them, where do I meet them, what do I say, if you are reading this you probably know where that was going so I\\'ll continue. Long story short I sat at a table with one empty chair and now I have 6 friends that I hang out with like every other day or so? So that\\'s a success hurray for me! They introduced me to a random girl they saw and became my first girlfriend, second success. Not to go into details but she was my \"first\" of a lot of things...3rd success? Does it count if she dumped me within a week to focus on studies?.... I like to think so... we\\'ll call that a half success I guess? The first day of college I told myself I\\'ll talk to the first person that catches my eye at all, it was a girl with a backpack that had a bunch of Eeveelutions on it from Pokemon. We talked the entire walk from the dorms to our classes. She dyed her hair red afterwards so she\\'s not the most eye catcher of them all because I really like dyed hair and stuff... it\\'s cool. I seen her around multiple times while hanging out friends and/or doing college stuff but I haven\\'t had the courage to talk to her again because either she\\'s with friends, or I\\'m not in the right state to talk to her without freaking out. Than one day me and one of my friends go to the cafe for lunch and boom there she is talking to a friend. I start rambling to my friend the numerous reasons why I shouldn\\'t talk to her. She has a friend. What if she\\'s not interested? What if she\\'s not interested in men??? It\\'ll look weird. I ended up tricking myself into sitting next to her and talking to her until they left because they were just about to leave before I sat down, that\\'s like what? 3.5 successes? She stayed longer to talk from what I thought. When she got up I panicked and asked \"hey we should exchange numbers so we can chat some more?\" She gave me her number and left and for the walk back to my dorm I was on top of the world........ it was fake btw. I see her everyday and it freaks me out now because of the number thing, so much that my friends warn me and give me cover ups to not confront her. Is that even a helpful thing? Because a part of my mind is very small and says \"M-maybe she didn\\'t mean to.\" A slightly louder voice says \"Maybe there\\'s still hope if just keep idle chit chat when you see here and wait until she asks for your number or something.\" Than there\\'s a really loud screaming voice that well... screams \"YOU BLEW IT!!! OR YOU NEVER HAD IT TO BLOW IN THE FIRST FACE!!!\" Today though I was in my solar system class and I saw this girl there that I found was really cute and... ok this is gonna sound weird because it\\'s like a class thing but the way she said Woden and could name all the Germanic gods was impressive for me... not the saying Woden thing that was a part of the cute thing. So I saw that she was right next to me walking out so I talked to her for a bit, didn\\'t catch her name but we have the same class so it\\'s like no rush, don\\'t want to mess things up like with Red hair... did I mention she had the same name and Major as my ex gf I previously mentioned? Anyways so that\\'s another opposite gender I talked to, 4.5 success! Man typing this is really helping me feel so much better about myself. So here\\'s the part where I get down again because I have to revisit it yaaaaay~ I was walking back to my dorm when I see the divine light from the sun bounce off the fiery scarlet mane of someone in front of me. I know we\\'ll be going the same way for almost the entire walk. So I make a quick cross of the road to be on the other side than her. That helped me but than I remembered the path we take, where now she\\'ll cross the road soon and since I\\'m on the other side it\\'ll be a direct collision instead of just me walking a few yards behind her as I would of earlier. This made me panic....I\\'m sounding pathetic... I hid behind this wooden fence thing that holds the dumpsters of what I assume is someone lives but it isn\\'t a dorm, anyways I stayed there for a few minutes. Calmed down breathed and drank some water. I couldn\\'t see if she passed the meeting point yet but I was like right there but hidden, but it been a while in relevant (is that the word?) to the amount of time it would take to pass the spot. So I got up and turned and started walking back to my dorm.... if I wasn\\'t paying attention I would of ran into her. Boom the collision I wanted to avoid is now here and worse! Because I hid! Did she see I hid? If she saw I hid than it must look like I did so in purpose of running into her. I don\\'t want to look like a stalker!!! I\\'m not a stalker! I was trying to avoid her! Not run into her! Why was she late to the spot! Did she hid too? Does she feel bad about the number? Or does she already don\\'t like me that much? It been like a solid...3 seconds of silence of me and her just walking... same pace because I tried slowing down to get behind her like what would of gone down but I got a good foot or so on her so my slow but not noticeably slow walk with my long legs is her average walk. I started talking to her just little stuff to ease the tension that I felt so much surely she felt it. She was nice to me and was helping me figure out thing involving the actual college stuff of college and than she left because her dorm building was closer than mine... and that\\'s it... I stayed in my dorm for the rest of the day and now I\\'m here writing this at midnight thinking why I am writing this I got class tomorrow morning.

I’m 24 and have never had a real job. I did some lawn care for a local business over the summer a few years ago, but I’m not sure if that really counts for anything. I also live with my parents and have never been to college. At all. I just had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and didn’t want to go into debt to confirm it. Might’ve also had something to do with my being an awful student in middle and high school. I wanted to get a job once I was old enough, but my family only had one car (which my dad needed) and we didn't live within walking distance of any businesses. We finally got two good cars a couple years ago, but by that point I knew employers would want to know why I had no experience at my age and was afraid that only fast-food restaurants would consider hiring me. I would rather do almost anything than that. Anyway, due to circumstances, I need to find a job before the end of the month. I found a few that might work, but the only one I really kind of want is a retail position at a hardware store. Unfortunately, the qualifications include strong interpersonal skills and strong communication skills. Not sure how my communication skills are. My interpersonal skills are definitely mediocre at best right now. While I'm hopeful that those would improve with practice, I’m not sure if they would give me a chance to find out. The only thing really going for me here is that my dad knows one of the employees and the manager. He stopped in with me a few days ago to ask the employee about a job, and he (employee) said that I should submit an application before Monday and come back *with my dad* next week to talk to the manager without an appointment. That’s really what I’m the most anxious about. This isn’t a formal interview. I have no idea how to prepare. Even though there's a position listed on their site, I suspect they may not actually be hiring right now. Even if they were, why would they want me over some outgoing 17-year-old^(1)? It’s just an entry-level job, but I *want* to work there. Still putting off actually applying. This is all just so overwhelming. I feel like a 24-year-old child. I don’t know what the point of this is. I guess I just wanted to say it.

For 6 months I’ve been working on conquering my social anxiety. I started this journey being horrified of cashiers. I was so desperate for social change in myself that I felt like every cashier interaction that didn’t result in a friendship was a failure. I was scared every time I left my room because I thought my roommates were felt I was a weirdo/loser. I would leave some of my social experiments so brutally judging myself for not being able to succeed that I began to feel suicidal. I’m describing this to show the difference between then and now. Well the other day, I went to a social meetup at a bar that was meant for ppl new to my area. I was so scared that I walked around the block twice before entering! I tricked myself into entering by telling myself “I’m just going to get a drink, and after that I’m leaving”. Upon entering I was immediately welcomed into a group by some random guy who recognized a shirt I was wearing. I nervously joined, but I did alright. IT WASN’T CATASTROPHICALLY BAD. I even made social mistakes, but they didn’t result in some giant humiliation, just a brief moment of heightened self consciousness. I went on just fine for an hour with these guys, and then another couple hours with random other people that were all there to meet ppl. It was beautiful! Ppl who were all there with the intention of being nice and socializing. Lots of ppl I noticed were a little nervous too, which made me realize that it’s kinda normal to be nervous! It’s not just me, and I’m not just broken. The biggest thing I’ve learned, however, is that my social anxiety is catastrophic and unrealistic. While I still get waves of embarrassment that hit me in conversations, the amount of time I spend fearing humiliation before/after the situation is so much less. It has happened often enough, and under the microscope that CBT has provided me, that I no longer reinforce the irrational idea that my mistakes will result in a giant humiliating event. The emotional side of my brain is really starting to understand that the risk of mistakes are not super high. It allows me to practice consistently, effectively and deliberately. I’m not ruining my chances quite as much by just telling myself how it’s gonna go terribly wrong. Because this fear has lessened so much, I was able to walk into that bar and say “even if the worst case happens, I’ll be okay”. This is NOT the same as confidence. During conversation, I’m still a people-pleasing, not-genuine, over-smiling person who rarely lets my actual personality come to the surface. I can’t help it yet. But I more often have moments where I allow myself to act natural, and it’s because I’m not so incredibly scared of some huge humiliating event. I’m chipping away at a belief that adds pressure to situations that shouldn’t be scary: that every small social mistake can lead to humiliation! Basically I’m getting better! As much as I haven’t allowed myself to feel small successes (mostly because the idea of a confident me sounds preposterous and unrealistic), I can no longer deny it! The change is so large and obvious that I no longer believe I’m stuck in this place. I believe there is a path out of this mess, to a more functional life. And I’m on that path :). It’s enough to bring me to tears honestly. Im 26 and social anxiety disorder has been lifelong, although I have been high functioning for a good portion of my life. But I just wanna say that change is possible. And CBT has REALLY fast tracked that for me. Please keep trying, and please get help. You all can do it! I wanna see this world have more people who’ve recovered from this horrible disorder, and more role models having an online presence.

Trying to pull an all-nighter everyday so I can regain control but I've failed every time. I didn't go out and mostly just stayed in my room for this entire week. Didn't shower, stopped taking care of myself, started sleeping in my clothes and wearing them again the next day, hardly ate at all because I've pretty much run out of food and have been eating the same exact thing everyday.

I've always had social anxiety, therefore I've never had many friends until I was fifteen. Through this friend I bonded with her cousin and we all became incredibly close. I truly thought our relationships were going to last until death. Well, four years later, this friend of mine left for the National Guard. Upon her return she was very different. I feel like in every relationship there are issues you'll have with that person, but you learn to adjust and focus on the more positive qualities. When she came back, those few small things that I needed to adjust to had succumbed her whole personality. She was very self - absorbed (even accusing my anxiety of being nothing compared to hers), critical and narcissistic I couldn't find a way to handle it, neither could our other friend. I lasted a bit longer. This other friend set sail rather quick and I understood why, it's just she left me as well. She said we were still friends, but we never hung out, she didn't message me and at one point she said we didn't need to talk because our relationship was so strong. I felt like that was her kind way of saying screw off. Now I'm alone again. I'm attending college but I doubt I'll meet anyone there due to being unable to make conversation or sound normal when attempting one. Maybe I've just given up. What's harder is the fall use to be our favorite season, the three of us, because we were huge Halloween lovers and were pretty active around this time of the year preparing. We went Halloween camping where we had theme costumes, did decorating, baking and of course haunted attractions. Now seeing Halloween stuff, or anything fall related, I'm just depressed and empty. \", ' TFW the most minuscule thing makes you feel like a complete idiot.. So I’m at my boyfriend’s grandmother’s house right now because he and his brother wanted to go visit her for the day. Everything was going fine and I was pretty proud of myself for socializing semi-normally and trying to be friendly and participate in the conversation and all that, but of course something had to go wrong. My boyfriend and I decided we wanted to go for a walk around the block, and right before he left he said he wanted to stop by his car and grab his keys for later. His grandma has two dogs, and they have a little gated backyard area that swings open and shut near the back of the house. One of the dogs is a 2 month old puppy and she pooped inside right before we left, so my boyfriend’s brother picked the poop up inside and took it out back to throw it away and I guess forgot to close the gate on his way back inside. My boyfriend went out to his car and said I could just wait for him out front, so I went through the front door and was waiting near the side of the house outside for my boyfriend and suddenly his grandma stopped me and called out, “Hey! Remember to shut the gate next time or the dogs will get out!” And she wasn’t like mean about it or anything but idk, I don’t handle conflict or criticism well at all so the whole thing made me tense up immediately, So I turn around and I’m like “What?” Because I have no idea what she’s talking about and I didn’t remember going through any gate. And then she repeats herself and I basically just like froze up and was like “Oh okay I’m sorry I didn’t even notice,” and awkwardly scrambled away. And now I just feel like an idiot because I’m not even the one who left the gate open but I look like a careless person because she thinks I left it open and I didn’t go back to close it, and when I told my boyfriend about it he got all frustrated and was like “Well you should’ve just closed it anyway and moved on since she’s my grandma and she told you to.” Which made me even more upset because at first I was like, why should I feel bad for not closing the gate if I’m not even the one who opened it? And why couldn’t I just have told her “Oh sorry, it must’ve been your grandson who forgot to close it taking out the dog poop but I’ll close it anyway for you right now!” Or literally anything besides what I ended up doing and saying. I just feel so stressed and dumb and now I’m gonna spend the rest of the night hiding upstairs and doing homework and trying to pretend I don’t exist. Fml. I just needed to vent. I really wish I could communicate and process things like a normal person sometimes. ', ' I hate this shit (but it might be looking up??). why is it so effortless for literally everyone else to speak to people? I feel like they all got a manual on how to be a normal person and I was sick the day they gave them out. I sit at breaks or in class with the group of people I consider my friends and they can all talk to each other so easily, but why can\\'t I? I just sit in silence and listen most of the time, and when I do say something I recite it and practice what I\\'m going to say in my head before I can even think of saying something. I feel like i\\'m invisible half the time, and I\\'m pretty sure my friends forget I exist - maybe that\\'s why most of them unadded me on social media and don\\'t add me to their group chats, and maybe it\\'s why they make plans infront of me but then don\\'t invite me (I\\'ve known them for about 5 weeks and in that time they\\'ve all met up twice, neither time with me). I feel like my perspective of friendship is so skewed; talk to me outside of class and I\\'ll consider you a close friend i thought going to 6th form at a new school would be a great fresh start, but apparently not as I\\'m still treated the way I\\'ve always been - generally excluded and mocked my anxiety is ruining my life. I feel like I\\'ve missed out on so many basic things that practically everyone experiences. i\\'m 16 years old and have never gone over to a friends house or gone to a sleepover. even my sister (who is younger than me and says she \"has no friends\") has been to loads of them. I\\'ve never done anything interesting that I\\'ve wanted to do cause of it, never started hobbies I\\'ve always wanted to do because of it. I\\'ve wanted to learn to skateboard for 2 years now (I even have a board) but I\\'m to scared to go onto the streets and practice or go to a skatepark and learn hopefully things might be looking up for me though. there\\'s a boy in my cs class I talk to outside of school sometimes - he gave me £2.12 and lent me his copy of bloodborne in exchange for a crochet thing I made, and he invited me to come to comic con with him and a couple of his friends. also, I went to the shops after school and managed to look around and buy stuff even from the men\\'s section which I normally avoid incase of getting weird looks or being judged for being a girl there and didn\\'t find it too bad, which is cool cause it\\'s the 1st time i\\'ve ever been anywhere further than a 10 minute walk away from my house by myself (other than school, but that doesn\\'t really count) ', ' My mom was a really shy kid too, so when I’d cry and say I don’t want to go to school, she’d see herself at that age and just let me stay home. If I told her I wanted to be picked up early, she’d just come pick me up. She also didn’t want to socialize with the moms at school/playground, so playdates didn’t really happen. I cried during my freshman year of high school and begged to be homeschooled. She felt bad for me and asked my dad about it. He was furious and said I would NOT be homeschooled, and honestly, I’m really glad he refused because I’m fairly certain I’d be worse off. When I have kids (not anytime soon), I plan on enrolling them in social activities like soccer or children’s theatre as soon as possible so they don’t have to suffer like I did.

I don\\'t go anywhere or meet new people, but I want to be with someone. It\\'s a constant struggle. Someone mentioned pursing hobbies. Might be a good idea. But if you\\'re like myself, and don\\'t really have any \"hobbies\", try networking at school or work. Go to parties with a friend you\\'re comfortable with; Go out and do something with a couple close friends that have some sort of interaction with other people (bars, parties, bonfires, etc.). It\\'s awesome being alone, and having your own free time. It sucks being lonely. But maybe it\\'s true when people say that it will happen when you least expect it. Just try to go out and have a good time, instead of dwelling on your current issues. Hope this helps. Good luck. ', \" Social anxiety &amp; awkwardness is killing me... help. If you take time to read this, I appreciate you. So I think I got it from some shit that happened to me when I was younger. I almost died twice and I went through some abusive shit in my childhood.. u know that stuff that happens to a lot of people. In 11 I went to play soccer for an academy where I was raised and been on my own etc.. and at the moment I'm 20 years old. I hit gym three times a week, sometimes I feel confident and more like an extrovert with the right people. But.. there are sometimes awkward situations that kills me inside. Like now. My brothers run an agency and from time to time I work there since it's in the office where I can focus. Today there was a new employee and I had so much stress before introducing myself you know.. It was awkward and I had not entirely panick attack.. But I was red, shy, awkward and couldn't speak properly.. u know that shit.. It is killing me so much because I'm really an extrovert. I love when I'm in the group of people that I know and can have fun with (doesn't have to be under alcohol influence). I love that and it gives me energy. But on the other side I'm also an introvert because sometimes I like to just mind my business at home. And it's been just worse and worse. Having anxiety when going through the city, now even in introduction with other people. I just want to cry now. So.. what can I do. I tried ETF tapping - I don't know doesn't helped me but I still do it sometimes. I tried affirmations, and other type of shit and nothing helped and I'm so done with that anxiety. I want to live my life to the fullest but shit is hard. I need some therapy I guess.. but what a person like me which has not a lot of money at the moment can do?? You know.. The best ones charge insane amount of money. I guess my life purpose as an entrepreneur will be to create some platform where you can get help for free haha. Anyways.. anyone has any tips? This shit is heavy burden and it's been making my life harder and harder. \", ' Social anxiety is draining my life - Exhausted, depressed... :(. Please, if you have a few minutes... Hear me out.. I really have nobody to talk to about this so I am going to just spill this out here. Social anxiety pushed me away from people - but I am actually an extrovert. I won\\'t dig more into that, but I love having a sense of belonging to some group - being able to hang out with people and meet new people. Being around socializing.. I love that shit man. My best memories are always with other people. But social anxiety made it really hard. To give a quick backstory: I played soccer at a professional club since I was 10 year old. I had to move to live with strangers - a different family in hundreds of miles away. It was my everything. At 16 I stopped socializing because I believed that \"working out hard while other people hanging out would make me best\" but I believe it actually ruined my ability to pick up social skills. Now, after 10 years I got played dirty and I kinda grew other passions, so I decided to focus on entrepreneurship / freelancing. One could say I failed in one thing and started pursuing the other. I had to move back to my parents, no car, no apartment - and no friends. I have no friends here and I am actually living in a village. The thing is, that I am of course 80% of my time in the next close city but there\\'s really nothing to do. I know very few people - you could say they\\'re friends / but we never go out together. I do everything alone.. Wait. I do only one thing besides working on my business and that\\'s a gym. And man.. I am so anxious around people and overthinking fcking everything. I am so mad.. Today I was in the gym with a friend - and he knew other guy that joined our conversation and I felt so anxious that when he said some joke, I couldn\\'t smile or even laugh. It\\'s so stupid man but I couldn\\'t.. I was probably so self-conscious that I just wasn\\'t able to make a proper interaction man.. I am so exhausted of this fcking stupid social anxiety. How come they don\\'t teach us this in a fkcing school?? Why they just tell you there are extroverts and introverts - but they don\\' tell you that it has nothing to do with how you feel about yourself and how to behave in social interactions. Fcking mad... So I bough a few books on social skills (Charisma is the myth and Dale Carnegie book) and I am ready to start practicing in daily interactions.. But I feel like I have bigger problem. This social anxiety... I tried ETF Tapping - I actually joined one online club where we were said we could overcome anxiety easily but it didn\\'t seem to work for me - since it was probably only in different language. I tried sleep hypnosis - but again probably different language videos didn\\'t help. I DIDN\\'T TRY therapist. But you know - living here in village gives you zero options without a car so my goal is to get a car, go live on my own and then get help but again.. I need help now it\\'s so hard to think right now.. I really need help.. I don\\'t know why I am writing this or even if someone will read this but yeah. I will appreciate any words or hear other people experiences.. This shit.. ahhh it fcking drains me ', ' Ah, so kinda like \"action reaction\" type of thing? I am only asking why people talk for fun because it just hit me, when others sit in class, they immediately talk to one another...me...if it is not to do with the work or how to get the best grade, i am just not interested. but is it THAT normal when people are in proximity they have to talk? but then, what does that lead to? EDIT: had a bit of a rough upbringing, bullying did not help, and I apologise for failing to understand these basic things. funny enough, even when it is sport like tennis, i tend to just focus on the game and when it is finished, i just go home. am i doing anything wrong here...i feel that i am. ', ' social anxiety with a girl at university. I am a 20 year old male 1st year student at university who is studying accounting. I am really struggling with making friends. In secondary school it is a lot easier to make friends because there are more group activities so is easy to make friends. In university, this is one of the first times I have been put in a situation to make friends from scratch and have bearly met anyone, at most only a few acquaintances. I feel like i don\\'t relate to anyone. The only thing I have relationship wise is with a girl I met in a seminar at the start of the semester. She is attractive girl and was really warm and nice to me so I was instantly in to her. I\\'ve never had a girl like that around me before. After that, we always sat next to each other for that one seminar each week and enjoyed each other\\'s company. As the weeks wait by, each lesson she would be really touchy by playfully punching my arm, leaning into me, putting her head on my shoulder and body language signs that she was into me. I was getting to the point where I would of asked her out around xmas time when for the first time we spent time with each other outside class having a coffee by ourselves and by spending that time with her, I was 99% sure she liked me. The opportunity never arose that day as there wasn\\'t a right moment. After the xmas break, in our seminar class where we sit next to eachother, she started to bring her mates into that class where they\\'d sit together and I would near her but not next to her. It gave us less opportunity to talk and after a few weeks I was not getting the same energy from her. From her being really into me to barely interested at all. I have tried to be around her friends but it\\'s hard for me to approach her with her friends with my SA and being nervous, shaky, racing heart and having a trembling voice in group situations and I don\\'t want to come across bad so I avoid those types of things like going to the cafe with them etc and that\\'s why I only spent time with her in that one seminar. The thought of me losing my chance with her was killing me inside which made my SA worse with me overthinking every little thing she would say to me and she would be the only thing I would think about all day. I know it\\'s over the top to think like that about someone I spend one lesson with per week but I can\\'t help it with this being the first girl I\\'ve genuinely like and who also liked me as well, also being a virgin so I don\\'t want to make a mess of it. I came to the conclusion to try and ask her out after the seminar I sit with her. I asked her quietly \"can we talk to you for a minute after class\". She said okay but when the class was fininshed and she was staying behind, her friends asked \"why are you waiting\" to which she replied \"i need to talk to john(me) for a second\". Which really baited out what I was going to do because it only means one thing to talk to someone by themselves which threw me asking her out with her friends around the corner 5 yards away. So I ended up asking her in a really uncomfortable way if she wanted to go to the cinema to which she replied \"I need to clean my house this whole week but definitely another time\". I think this is just a nice way of saying no. It\\'s been a week since this has happened and this has really put me down and overall really dislike what I am like around people because I am a decent person to be around once I am comfortable around people. I\\'ve struggled sleeping with me not being able to take that moment out of my head and cringing of the thought of that moment by embarrassing myself and messing up the only chance of having a potential girlfriend and some sort of social interaction. I don\\'t have any friends or social life outside university, only play golf but that is a private hobby so this made the situation worse as I don\\'t have anything to fall back on. I have avoided trying to bump into her because of the awkwardness and the fear of the looks I\\'ll get from her friends with them knowing. Can anyone give me any advice on what I should do when I next see her next and their opinion on the whole situation with her, if you think there is any chance because I feel confused on how someone could suddenly lose interest. Thanks ', ' Advice for a very lonely guy[25]. I\\'ve looked around for a while on Google and Reddit for helpful advice, but nothing really matches my situation, so I decided to make a profile and see if you people have any advice. I\\'m not totally sure what my question is, but maybe you can help anyway. I will italicize parts of this post that are optional, but provide some background info for people who want it. I\\'m on my phone, so I apologize for any spelling/grammar errors. *ME: I\\'m a 25 year old male. I currently live at home with my parents but will be moving out next month into an apartment by myself. I\\'m a high school teacher with a good education and supportive, loving family. I\\'m very introverted (INTJ for those who like that stuff) and have always been slower at making friends. I don\\'t currently have many. I\\'ve been in one, 4 month relationship that ended in June 2015, and that was the last time I had sex. I met her because the was the only single, attractive female that I knew through mutual friends. I, myself, am very average in every way.* I have a hard time making a post like this or complaining because there are SO many people in the world who have it SO much worse than me, but I\\'m very, very lonely. I usually spend days off and weekends sitting on the computer. I do have hobbies, but they are not \"social\" hobbies (gym, fishing, skiing, more recently stand-up paddleboarding. [these things can be altered to be \"social,\" but I somehow prevent myself from doing that, and generally like to be left alone while I\\'m doing them]). I live in the Midwest, so there\\'s specific windows when I\\'m able to do each thing. Also, I\\'m not able to do these every day, or sometimes for a few weeks. My current friends have exactly zero interest in these things. *I\\'ve recently come to the realization that my friends are actually pretty terrible to me, and really only use me for their own needs. Maybe that\\'s the way friendship always is, but I\\'m not exactly the most social person ever, so I might be difficult to hang out with. I am always the designated driver (started making them pay), and the butt of jokes because I\\'m not very respected (possibly for my lack of sports knowledge or experience with girls, the two most important things in life). Firing back in my own defense (even jokingly) results in \"you\\'re a douchebag\" or \"you don\\'t need to be mean.\" In any case, I didn\\'t come here to complain about them, but I\\'m just describing why I\\'ve decided to hang out with them less and less. Unfortunately, I don\\'t have anyone to replace them with.* *My co workers are great people, but most are married or in relationships. I dated a teacher from another department a few times this past year before she lost interest for whatever reason and stopped texting me. They always ask when I\\'m going to find a girlfriend, but I don\\'t have many opportunities to find one.* I try to accept any party or get-together invitations whenever I get them; I don\\'t get them very often. When I do go, I struggle when talking to people or keeping the conversation flowing, especially with girls. I get into the mindset of, \"this person doesn\\'t care what I\\'m talking about\" or \"I\\'m just rambling.\" I know, it\\'s a bad mindset to have, but I struggle with it nonetheless. The topics usually go to sports or something, but I just don\\'t have anything to offer in that category. I don\\'t watch much TV, and can\\'t keep up with all of the \"stats\" and shit. A lot of advice I\\'ve already read is, \"just go find people you have things in common with.\" To me, this is a complete mystery. It\\'s almost like saying, \"stop being sick\" to someone who has a cold and expecting it to help. Even if I did find people who shared my hobbies, they are often much better at whatever it is, and they see me as some child who wants to follow along. I get the impression that anything I offer is looked over or seen as me being a \"know it all\" because the conversation quickly turns from there and never goes deep. I check my tone and wording, and I can\\'t figure out what I\\'m doing wrong. *I have a Tinder profile but don\\'t get many matches (1-2 per month) I live near a city, so there\\'s never a shortage of girls, but I have high standards, I think. It seems that most girls who fit my standards are not into me. Maybe I\\'m irrational in my standards: petite/slim/athletic (not chubby or \"curvy\"), shorter than me (I\\'m 6\\'1\"), preferably younger than me, and independent. My motto is \"don\\'t hold anyone to standards you can\\'t hold yourself too,\" but maybe I hold myself to standards that most people don\\'t hold themselves to. In any case, matches I do get fizzle out; I\\'m not very flirty, sexual, or witty.* When social situations do arise, I find it difficult to engage in the conversation or stay focused. In many cases, I just want to go be alone. But I also crave that social contact and desire for acceptance! I feel like when I\\'m alone I want to be with people, and when I\\'m with people, I want to be alone. Like I said, I\\'m not totally sure what my question is. Maybe it\\'s \"what am I doing wrong\" or maybe it\\'s \"will you help me make friends.\" Generally, my biggest statement here is \"help.\" Despite the fact that I was tearing up through this whole post, I\\'m a grown ass man and I really shouldn\\'t have to ask, but I just need some kind of guidance here. *TLDR: I\\'m a 25 year old male who is very lonely and struggles talking to people or making connections. Please help.* ', \" I'm glad you got better, friend. For me it was almost the opposite. I was never anxious while I was still in school. I had an absolutely fantastic social life back then.

Social anxiety for me only really kicked in in my early 20s and for no apparent reason. I wish to get better as well. \", ' How bad would you say my social anxiety is?. * When I have an event planned that requires social interaction (for example, literally anything from ordering food at a restaurant or giving a presentation to a group of people), I get mildly to very anxious even days before the event happens. Only once the event has passed I feel at peace again. I go over what I should say in advance, in my head. * I feel completely relaxed and fine around people I know, but around strangers I always get a little guarded. * I rarely if ever actually make any fuck ups when I get into an uncomfortable social situation, and afterwards it seems like it wasn\\'t bad in retrospect, but it\\'s the anticipation and \"build up\" to the event that kills me. From outside I seem totally calm and normal. I never have any panic attacks or anything extreme like that. * I find it much worse to initiate conversation with a stranger than have a stranger initiate conversation with me. * When I\\'m walking outdoors and see a stranger coming from the distance, I start looking around, trying to avoid eye contact, and start overthinking whether I should say hi or not, if I should look at them or not, etc. I get slightly anxious from this. * I\\'m very avoidant of situations where social interaction is mandatory, like shopping alone, ordering food, etc. Granted, I still live at home so it\\'s not exactly required in my current situation. I don\\'t have a job because of this, though. Never had a job before or shopped alone. * If I end up having a positive experience with a particular situation I feared beforehand (like going to a party of a family member who you barely know), the next times after that I will either fear that particular situation less or not at all. * I feel much more anxious around people my age or slightly younger than me than older people. I actually barely feel anxious around elders. * Some days I can have trouble even looking at people in videos or fictional media like games or anime. Not always though. Usually happens when I haven\\'t seen anything like that in a while, repeated exposure cures it.

You can’t improve 2 things at once you have to choose. Quality of life (Education, Work, Hobbies) or the Relationship/Dating route. You have to take it slow and improve. If I ask for advice 24/7 but take no action I’ll still be on step 1. It’s not going to be easy, you’re going to be uncomfortable but that’s how you improve. You don’t like your life? You need to change. Also, mate you’re not ugly I’ve seen you around. Get that thought out of your fucking head please. All these negative feelings and self hatred only pushes you further down the rabbit hole. Any negative subreddits your subbed to please do yourself a favor and leave them. If you want an honest answer I believe right now your a 5/10 but here’s the thing you can change that number. Physically and how you present yourself. You CAN change. I personally would work on the physical. Like here’s a few examples. I would workout and incorporate it into your day-to-day life. This doesn’t mean going one time to the gym and quitting. I might start walking 1 day a week, then maybe I would increase the duration or distance of the walk, then I might start running or I’ll improve the days I workout. Slow improvements. Also, this doesn’t have to be at the gym you can start at home or drive to a park and do calisthenics . Remember this is going to be for you. You’re not going to improve for the girl. You do it because you like it. You’ll feel better. It makes you feel happy. Personally it helps me with my stress and anger/bitterness I use that as fuel to push my body. I would also work on getting a job, save up that money and maybe get a therapist in the future especially depending on costs. Here I gave you advice now it’s your choice, ignore it or take a leap and change for the better. ', ' Ok I’ll try to help you. (Long) Step 1. Delete Instagram. And don’t turn back it’s not worth it, your time is worth more and it’s definitely not worth looking over people’s pictures and then being depressed after. I myself, used to do this, I would stalk classmates that I never talked to or old friends, people that I used to know and I would be depressed and cry. Fuck that. Step 2. Figure out what you want to do. You need a goal. Something to start slow, you can’t just jump into something full blast and expect to keep up. So the good thing is you already have some ideas. You said, “I don’t have hobbies and don’t have the social life I want”. Ok, so this is the part where you will pick/decide on what to do. I would suggest on something easy first and then continue on your journey by adding more things. If you don’t have the social skills it’s going to be a long slump of improving and learning which might be demotivating especially if you have a bad experience. I would suggest getting a small hobby or goal. Something you do everyday or whatever schedule you set. Having a goal and completing that goal makes you feel fulfilled even if it’s not that big. Maybe something that you can do alone at first, then introduce people later on. I’ll try to give some suggestions for hobbies.

If you still don’t have ideas you can pm and I can try to help. Now the point is there’s unlimited things in this world that you can do, from boxing to knitting to learning about cats to learning about murder mysteries. The problem is procrastination and not knowing what to do or how to start. Step 3. Getting Started. Ok so let’s say you picked reading as your hobby. Don’t expect your going to start reading everyday or even every other day. Go get a book, something interesting maybe the Harry Potter series. Go to this subreddit r/theXeffect and make a schedule on whatever you’re doing. Maybe you can try read 10 minutes a day or 20 minutes every other day. You could also just read 1 time a week and not specify the minutes. Whatever you choose. Just make it slow and doable. This sub has helped me brush my teeth everyday, I was real depressed and I stayed in bed all day, and didn’t have the greatest of hygiene. It was fixed with time. AND BOOM! You completed something and now you feel better about yourself :) I would suggest posting on their for motivation or get an accountability partner if you need it.

The second best time is now” - Chinese proverb ', \" What does it mean when I'm too shy to ask my coworkers to take me home?. So I have a problem with buses around my workplace, and I was supposed to go home a few times pretty late but it meant I should wait an hour for the bus to arrive. A few of those times I decided I won't wait and walked for 20 minutes on foot in a dangerous path near the road where cars drive literally a few centimeters away from my body to get to another bus station, because I really needed to get home. The thought of asking someone to take me there never occurred to me(even though it's just a 2 minute ride). I honestly just gave excuses to myself as for why I shouldn't ask anyone. Because they are busy at work/because there's no one that can take me. I had absolutely no idea I could ask someone to take me there and go back to the workplace, and frankly I didn't even try, I just assumed nobody can. Even at times when we have to decide for 1 person to stay, I always feel guilty and selfish when I go home instead of someone else, although I do haves stuff to do at evening. I used to agree to stay but it meant I'd have to do this dangerous 20 minute walk to get to the bus station. I honestly hate that I do this, I make myself so small compared to other people that I'd rather suffer than ask someone to take just 4 minutes of their time to drive me somewhere. I was wondering why I had this fear. Maybe I was afraid of bothering them, or of them disliking me because of it, as irrational as I know it is. The fact that I'm a people pleaser really puts me at a tough spot and I hate being like this, I feel so submissive and quiet when I'm really not just because I'm afraid of bothering someone else/angering them/making them dislike me. I can't even confront people face to face, and in the rare occasions I try(usually it's with someone I'm comfortable with), I do it with zero confidence and I prepare to apologize once they react badly. I even have a hard time speaking clearly in front of people I'm uncomfortable around because I don't want to burden them and they end up not hearing me sometimes. I cant pretend it doesn't bother me when someone else is disappointed or disturbed by a decision that I have made, even if I try to take a risk and do it or ask for help. Does anyone have tips for how I can overcome people pleasing? How can I overcome being too shy to ask people for help? \", 'How’s your social anxiety during confrontations?. I had an incident yesterday where I was walking my dog through the neighborhood and she peed on the the edge of this house’s lawn. This lady comes out of her house and starts cursing at me, says she’s gonna beat my ass as she gets up in my face. There was some back and forth and then she said “I’m gonna shoot your dog.” At this point I was so angry I started recording with my phone and repeated what she said. Since I had her on video she backtracked and said “with a BB gun” and then she scurried back in her house. I was absolutely livid and that completely overrided any social anxiety. I did call the police to report the incident and that was hella anxiety inducing, my voice was all shaking talking on the phone. When the officer came to my house I had my mom with me while I was talking to him and that took some of the edge off How are you guys in these types of situation? I feel like while I’d normally be apprehensive about calling 911 my sheer anger helped me overcome that', 'I feel like I\\'m not a good bf. Hello, fellow redditors! As you can imagine, I have some severe problems which make me believe I\\'m missing so much of my own life and kinda like throw away all the good stuff. I haven\\'t had good experiences with psychologists, and that\\'s why I hope someone here can help me \\\\- at least a little bit. I\\'m 18 years old and don\\'t have much friends. Actually I wouldn\\'t even call them \"friends\", because they are either my girlfriend or colleagues. In school I always was kind of popular for some reason, but I never got to that point, where you are a real friend to someone, like doing stuff together, talking about everything and so on. I don’t even know why. Well \\\\- I know one thing \\\\- it was always my fault. Maybe even on purpose. It\\'s not that people didn\\'t want to be my friend! As long as I can remember \\\\(still to this day\\\\) I have some serious trust issues with everyone. If someone’s nice to me, I immediately suspect anything bad and try to think of reasons why they are nice to me and what they want. So I guess that’s the main reason I don’t really have friends. Life went on and everything is going very great for me. When I think about it, I don’t have any single problem right now \\\\(apart from this topic of course\\\\). Over the years I learned how to fake confidence, because it’s very important for my job. But apart from my workplace I’m still the anxious little boy that trusts no\\\\-one. No\\\\-one except for my girlfriend! I met her two months ago and there were some chemistry between us immediately. Luckily she did the whole stuff like asking me out first and when I’m with her I feel safe and secure, because I believe she likes me as I am. I don’t know why I think she couldn’t betray me so easily. Actually very naive of me when I think of it… Yesterday she got an invitation to a barbecue and told me I could come, too. She got invited by some people she also didn’t even know very well and apparently they said her boyfriend is also invited. First I said I would love to come, but I guess she knows me too well and noticed I don\\'t really feel comfortable about it. So we agreed that it was totally okay for her to go alone, which I was very glad of. The problem was that a\\\\) they were many people and b\\\\) not even my gf knew them well. At the end of the evening they decided to go partying and from this point my mind went totally crazy and my heart pounded like shit. I imagined her being with other guys, being in dangerous situations, but most importantly it bugged me that I haven\\'t been with her. Not because I\\'m jealous or I don\\'t trust her, more because I felt like a really shitty boyfriend. I mean, I\\'m happy enough to have a girlfriend in my condition, but I could scare her away so easily with my problems. The thing is that is would never be possible for me to to a bar or a club, like almost everyone in my age does. Apart from the many people who are in these locations, I don\\'t even get the point of buying overpriced alcohol and dancing in front of foreign people. Isn\\'t that so embarrassing? I couldn\\'t sleep the whole night, later her new\\\\-found friends have brought her home \\\\(which isn\\'t actually my duty as a bf?\\\\), and she always texted me, which was really cute from her, so at least now I don\\'t have pictures of her being with other dudes in my mind anymore. But it really nerves me that I\\'m not capable of having fun and going out like a normal social human being! I want to spend time with her, maybe even with her friends \\\\(btw, she wrote that I already might have fucked up with them, because apparently they expected me to come\\\\) and also would like to experience the atmosphere of a club some time. But my anxiety just doesn\\'t let me. In the moment I just fear losing her because of my problems, and I really don\\'t want this to happen. She means so much to me. I wrote a long text to her, explaining how I feel and that I\\'m sorry I\\'m so special. I also asked why she\\'s with me. She could easily find someone better, everyone\\'s better than me as a boyfriend. Anyway \\\\- Let\\'s hope for a good response when she wakes up. I can imagine some of you are in a similar position and maybe even found a way to get over this. I would love to hear every single tip you have for me, because I really want to work on myself! Sorry for this wall of text and eventual grammar mistakes, English is not my native language. Thanks in advance!', ' I failed... again.... So today I wanted to go to the hairdresser and get a haircut. Nothing special just shorten my already way too messy hair.

I couldnt go to a place where i literally have to sit and wait. No action on my part is needed I just need to wait 20minutes until im done and I couldnt do it.

What do you guys and girls do when you want to do something? How do you motivate yourself? I know positive thinking and to not overthink stuff is important but my body just autopilots and i get stomache aches. I just dont know what to do anymore ', ' I feel like I need some advice to get over whatever anxiety I have left.. Hi. First post in this sub. So let me first begin by describing myself. I am a 22 year old guy. As a child I was always considered a shy boy. I didn\\'t speak much when in a group. This made my family and relatives think I was an introvert and didn\\'t have a lot friends (which honestly weirded me out a bit as I was often asked \"You don\\'t have a lot of friends, do you?\" or \"How many friends do you have?\"). However, in school, I always felt I was a different person somewhat. I did actually have friends. Not as many as someone not anxious or not shy, but I always put myself around my friends when in school. So anyway, fast forward a few years to the last year in my school, I finally started talking with girls of my class. So by now you may have figured I was less shy than before. But still a lot shy. Around this time you would expect a guy to hang out with his friends all the time. *I believe I low key always wanted that.* However, I lived some 6 miles from my school and I had no bicycle or motor vehicle to travel that far every day (as most of my school friends lived near the school). So I ended up staying at home all day and playing video games. With girls (and now women), I had it worse. Till about my 11th grade, I didnt speak to a lot of girls. Barely if any. In my 11th grade, I started making a few girl friends but I never talked to them as much as my guy friends. We hung out like once or twice but once school was over I couldnt meet them as often and didn\\'t text them a lot either. Moving on to relationships, the first true crush I had was in 7th grade I believe. She lived close to me and went to school in the same bus. I first texted her on social media and we got to talking. I believe we became \"social media\" friends but I never really talked to her in person because I was afraid of I dont know what. She eventually left my school and I never really got to talk to her again. The second crush I had was the time I started approaching girls. I still didnt talk as much as a normal guy would but I met this girl in my class. We sat next to each other waiting for our class to begin. 15 minutes of silence later I asked for the time or something. We started talking and moved on to texting. This time I spoke in person more than last time (but again, not as much as a normal person would). We became really good friends. She suddenly disappeared so that was over. **This was my school life** Now comes my recent university life. I was more outgoing now that I had to stay in my university for atleast 8 hours a day. My life was definitely happier (since surprise, I am actually an extrovert). I was still a bit shy but I no longer was scared of casual group gatherings. In fact, I enjoyed those. Life still sucked past 5 PM because I still did not have a mode of transport to travel 8 miles everyday. But it was better than before. Here I met my third crush. She is an introvert and had an attitude. I could now talk to women better (again, not as good as a normal guy) but something about her made me very nervous. I tried talking to her for 2 years, couldn\\'t. In my 3rd year was when I started talking to her properly. But she never showed interest in knowing me so I eventually lost interest in her and generally avoid her. And this was my history of my anxiety. I finished my 4 years in the university yesterday. About six months ago I was at my absolute worst. I still couldnt hang out with my friends after 5 PM. I had to stay home after that and I started getting depressed and had negative thoughts. Anxiety peaked. Thats when my father said something to my younger sister, you and your mother are the only extroverts in our house. Something did not feel right. I knew the actual meaning of both the terms, and I didnt feel like an introvert that my father labelled me. I soon learned that I am actually an extrovert, but I had social anxiety. Thats when I first came across the term. Realising that I had social anxiety helped me a lot to fight it. I suddenly had my anxiety decreased a lot. I now make friends VERY easily. I have made more friends in the past 6 months than I had made in the past 4 years. Obviously, in situations I realised that my fears were irrational. However, I haven\\'t been completely been able to overcome it. I will give some instances. &gt;**1** I am still not great at talking with women. I have always felt that I am a sub-human. I think that I am not good looking (even though I have been told otherwise), I will bore them if I talk to them which means I can\\'t make the first move ever, or that something about me will repel any potential dates I could have. &gt;**2** My family has been broke for the past 4 years. My (fairly) large friend circle asks me to hang out. One friend circle spends a lot of money so I haven\\'t hanged out with them in about 2-3 years. I feel bad about it but for some reason I can\\'t tell them that I am broke as fuck. I can\\'t afford to go to a restaurant or coffee place every other day and have some A grade shit. They feel that I don\\'t think them as friends anymore. And my anxiety makes me feel really bad about it. &gt;**3** Sometimes I feel truly confident. Very confident in fact. In that state sometimes I get the job done whatever it may be, but sometimes when the work actually comes, I panic and stop myself from doing the work or avoid the public gathering. I realise that my fear is irrational but it just consumes me. &gt;**4** Sports. As I said, anxiety and shyness are truly fucking terrible. I never was able to play sports for long because I felt I sucked and everyone hated me for that. Today as I am less anxious and more interested in sports, I feel like playing a soccer, but most of my friends have been playing (with people) for several years and they are atleast good at it. I know I can\\'t keep up with them and honestly it doesnt matter because at this age, they aren\\'t going to make it to the international leagues either. But for some reason, I fear being judged still. &gt;**5** I made a few girl friends over the years now but I still can\\'t talk to them as much because I feel I will be boring to them. My anxiety ruins my friendships with them. One of the main reason why I truly want to get over my anxiety. When I talk to them I realise that these girls consider me a friend, but I can\\'t just speak with them properly and maintain that friendship. In January, I plan on started MMA classes since I learned that physical fitness and exercise helps in you confidence, a lot. But I want some other advises that can make me get over my anxiety completely. My life would be so much better if I do, so please help. Thank you ', \" First Job with social anxiety and depression help!. Hello. I'm 21 years old and I live in Italy. Tomorrow I'm gonna have a job interview my mum got me and I'm freaking out. I've worked a lot as a translator and as a graphic but since my computer died i can't do that anymore. Also I'm broke and I have a dog who is sick and you know,i need money. I've never worked outsite my house. I know it's bad i really know that. I suffer from depression,panic attacks and social anxiety and sometimes the panic attacks get really bad at the point I pass out. It's been this way for years and I go to a therapist once a week but i never got better and I can't afford to go to someone else. So,tomorrow I hava a job interview. There's this bar on the beach and they need a waitress who can speak a few languages. I can speak fluently italian,english and french,a little bit of german and swedish so i know i could get the job. But right now I'm panicking so much because I've never done a job like this,and it would mean to stay in contact with other people and look happy and talk and even thinking about doing it makes me feel horrible. Also I can't stop thinking about how it would be if I screw up a order and I can feel a panic attack coming soon and I just don't know what to do. \", \" I don't know how to approach this... So, this is a bit complicated.I'm a 19 y/o guy studying at university at the moment. This is my third year in uni, 2nd in my current study programme (I quit my first study on a different uni). I haven't really made any real friendships/connections from uni, although I often work with one person I can get along with very well. Outside of studying we don't really do anything outside of uni.In the first year at the other uni, I didn't have any friends except my cousin with whom I often play games via Discord and formerly Teamspeak. When I was in high school, I didn't have any friends. I tried to connect with other people, but I was too anxious. The 6 years I was in high school was definitely the worst time of my life. Especially in the lunch breaks I felt horrible, I often went home on my bicycle, even though it took up a large part of the break time. I did this because I did't know where to sit (our school was horribly crowded in the breaks, there weren't even enough tables). I also feared sitting with my classmates, this fear grew stronger in the later years. Back to my cousin, he plays an important role in my current social life. He was in a different high school, and I was 2 years ahead of him. Around 2014-15 we started gaming via Teamspeak, which was a big relief for me, as I didn't have any other way to socialize with people. After a while, a few classmates of his also joined, and ever since we still talk via Discord all the time. Currently it's my cousin, my brother (he was 2 grades lower at my high school, I will explain his role in the story below) and two friends of my cousin (classmates) which are in Discord all the time, and we are basically friends. When I quit my first year on uni halfway through, I started working at a supermarket for a while before starting my next study. While working there, I saw my cousin's classmates for the first time, which was a bit awkward, but nothing too bad. It was nice seeing them irl for the first time. Now my brother. He is 1 year younger than me, and was 2 grades below me. He did have some friends, but one best friend which he still is. Since around 2016, when I was in my last year, he went to the disco/club (not sure what to call it, it's basically an empty hall packed with people where dance/big room house is played by a DJ) with my cousin and some other friends, and he quickly made friends with those people (including the Teamspeak/Discord group). I forgot the order in which the connections grew, but it's not that important. Back to today, what it comes down to is that my brother, his friend, and the friend group of my cousin (and kinda me, limited to Discord) became one big friend group. For like 2 years now, they go the the club almost every Saturday or Friday night. And I? I never went to a club even once. I'm too socially anxious. In the beginning I was not interested in night-life, however, after a while I regret never going. It would have been a great way to get to know the friend group better.I feel like I'm too late at this point in time. Every time they go out, they send video's and pictures on our Snapchat group chat, and it makes me feel sick in the stomach to see them having fun, while I'm at home doing nothing. Aside from going to the club, they do a lot more fun things together like going on a vacation to Spain, and this year to Albufeira, or going to birthday parties or other random parties from people I don't even know. I feel horrible to be disconnected from those events, and the fact that they have many more friends than me. The problem I have is that I don't how to get involved in those social activities. I'm extremely anxious to go to the club with them, especially because they have done it a myriad of times, while I have never been to the club. A few times my cousin has asked me to join, but I said no because I was too anxious. I instantly regret it, but didn't do anything about it. After all this time I fear to go with them, I don't how to behave at the club, and them having all this 'experience' makes it even worse.The fact that my brother is involved in all these social events makes it extra hard for me, it makes me feel like an outcast. I've always portrayed myself to my brother as someone who doesn't like parties and that kind of stuff. I feel like I need to break this image of myself from my brother and my cousin. I feel like it would've been a lot easier if my brother wasn't involved in this group of friends. I would greatly appreciate if someone can help me break the status quo and get more connected with my friends. The greatest fear that I need to break is going to the club with them, which feels like a massive threshold.Maybe someone has been through something similar, and can share his or her experience. \", ' I just got back from my first date ever.. I am 20 years old and male. Like many of you my social anxiety has made me shy away from women and dating. A couple months ago I met a girl a couple years older than me that works at my mom\\'s workplace. For a long time I didn\\'t reach out to her out of fear of the outcome, as well as self destructive thoughts: \"she\\'s too good for me\" \"It\\'s been too long. It would be wierd now\". I got myself into a better place mentally and finally realized I have nothing to lose by trying. I texted her saying I would like to get to know her better and I asked if she wanted to get coffee with me. She agreed and we planned a time. Getting that message saying she did want to go out with me made me the happiest I have felt in awhile. It was almost like a drug. I read the message and a wave of happiness washed over me and suddenly I got the motivation to just do something. So I did some exercising which I have a lot of trouble making myself do. A few days later she told me she was going to meet a (female) friend afterward to eat and asked if I wanted to join them after the two of us got coffee. I agreed. initally I was really excited, but as the day approached that excitement was replaced with anxiety. About 30 minutes before my stomach was in knots. On the drive there I was doing deep breathing exercises to keep myself from freaking out. I was early so I was in my car repeating to myself: \"you can do this\" \"She is just a regular person\" \"She is going to be nervous too\" Then I saw her walk into the coffee shop. \"This is it\" I told myself. I got out and walked in. I saw her and we said hello and exchanged pleasantries. We ordered and she said she would pay for herself. I said I was happy to get it for her, but I did not insist and I let her pay for herself. We walked out to the benches outside and talked for awhile. I had done lots of research on first date conversation to prepare myself. We talked about her job, our pets and my job. We both went to the same university, but at different times. We both dropped out. That created quite a bit of conversation topics. We even got off on a political discussion somehow. This actually worked out well since we have similar views on the subject. Afterward we walked to the restaurant which was just down the road and met her friend. It was actually really nice having her friend there. It took some of the pressure off me to keep conversation going. Again we all paid for our own food, but I did offer to take care of the appetizer we all shared and I did. Once the night was over her friend left and just me and her walked together until we got to my car. We said goodnight and she said she would like to see more of me. I said I wanted to see her again as well and we went our separate ways. I feel so accomplished. I kicked my anxiety in the nads and did something that makes even a normal person nervous. Sure I was a little quiet and I didn\\'t say a whole whole lot about myself. Still I\\'m glad I got the chance to get to know her and to my suprise I actually had quite a bit of fun. ', ' bicycle fightig. So I went into the grocery store tonight on my bike and this girl employee says nice bike. I fumble for the words to say with this unexpected remark, emitting something that sounds alien. Then after grading a few items I make my way to the checker...same girl. She says something real fast that I don\\'t comprehend until a few minutes later...\"I took your bike\" Then she notices my knuckle that got a cut early and says \"what happened to your knuckle\" I fumble for the words to say and spit out \"bicycle fighting\", she repeats what I said with the most perplexed look and I turn red and scurry out the door. What was going through my head with all this talk about my bicycle, just say bicycle, then I though that sounds stupid. So I say fighting thinking it will make me sound tougher. What a day, what a day. ', ' It\\'s my birthday today and I hate the trajectory my life is taking.. I just turned twenty 3 hours ago and am no longer a teenager. I have noticed that my life trajectory is heavily sloping downwards. I consider myself to have two real friends, both who are on the other side of the US going to a different University so I will be spending it alone with my parents (I have never had a conversation with them longer than 5 minutes because of a serious language barrier). Also my sister and I do not get along at all, so I have no strong familial connections. I withdrew from church when I was 16 because I lost my faith, and only now realize that I lost so many genuine friends along with it. I go to my state university, so I see them around but I actively avoid them due to my SA. They invite me on Facebook to church events but I always decline. And I always worry about how many people will post Hbd to my Facebook wall. I probably average 8-12 a year, and it always makes me sad when I see some getting 60+. I\\'ve never had a girlfriend or even a female friend I would consider close. I don\\'t consider myself to be attractive, but I definitely don\\'t think I\\'m unattractive. I am more on the lean side because I run and play basketball. In eigth grade (before puberty really hit me and developed my SA), I remember heavily flirting with this cute girl in 7th grade and developed a strong bond. Then I didn\\'t see her for a year cause I went to high school (9th grade) and she was in 8th grade. I\\'ll never forget the moment the year after when she came up to me (when I was 10th grade and she was 9th grade) and said hi all excitedly, and I pretended that I barely knew her because I didn\\'t know how to handle the situation and gave her a very uninterested response even though I still liked her. Then when I was in senior year of high school, she became my physics AP partner by some random luck and I felt so awkward every single day. She eventually ended up dating one of my \"friends\" which killed me inside. This may sound pathetic but I still like her a lot and sometimes fantasize about her in my dreams (like what it would be like to spend a day with her at the county fair). I realize this is unhealthy but I can\\'t help it All the current friends I have are stoners and druggies. I experimented heavily with weed in senior year, and eventually everyone in my social group in high school smoked weed constantly including me. I believe there\\'s nothing wrong with weed, but I sort of had a revelation in sophomore year of college that I didn\\'t want to be a druggie (they started doing shit like xanax, Molly, oxy, lsd, whippets, and I just didn\\'t want to associate with them), so I stopped hanging out with them. And college. Oh boy. I thought this would be where my life would change for the better. Nope, I\\'m still a shitty human being with zero social skills and it\\'s tough making friends as a shitty human being with zero social skills. I went to one party and ended up puking everywhere and I try to repress that memory. I also have zero hobbies besides video games. I always thought at least I was smart, but college sure proved me wrong (I always score average on exams now). I\\'m struggling to maintain my scholarship (I need a cumulative 3.2 and I have a 3.25 right now) So here I am. A little drunk in my bed on my phone, nowhere near close to feeling sleepy. I really just wanted to rant. My social anxiety for sure caused my depression since 12th grade, and freshmen year of college I went through some heavy suicidal thoughts. At least now they aren\\'t as frequent and don\\'t hit as hard sophomore year. Basically, I fail at living life. I wish you all eventually find happiness if you\\'re struggling with it, and I hope we are all able to overcome our social anxiety/depression one day. Edit: holy shit I did not realize I wrote this much. I\\'ll probably end up deleting this when I wake up tomorrow morning anyways ', ' that\\'s true and over the summer I came to that realization as well. but having social anxiety I just can\\'t seem to do it. I know it sounds like making excuses, but that\\'s just my reality. I have no friends here and doing things alone is awful with social anxiety. so I\\'m constantly not doing anything even to follow my own path because of the interactions I would have to endure. and the worst thing about it, is that I\\'m 6\\'6\" and a black male. that makes it so much worse I can\\'t connect with anyone. I can talk to people about sports or little stupid small talk subjects, but that\\'s only good for a period of time. I\\'m into politics, an atheist, and very intelligent. having to open up to people I don\\'t know very well just seems impossible. like who\\'s going to be accepting of a black atheist in America? especially other blacks who are most likely Christian or religious. or like who wants to talk about politics, especially other African Americans at 20 years old. I\\'ve always had these expectations of me because of how I look, \"oh you must play basketball\" can\\'t imagine how many times I had to hear that. like no, I grew up playing baseball and football I would appreciate people to stop making prejudgments about me because of how I look. just makes me want to end it. then I\\'m not into anime like other people my age, especially other African Americans. I have grown and matured past that, I used to like it when I was in 4th grade. now I just can\\'t connect with people on any level. ', \" Anxiety around people from back home. So I went to college very far away 16 hours and basically fixed my anxiety there. I love it there have friends, get girls, etc basically anxiety is no issue for me up there and I would say it's basically gone. Right now I went with my friends to the beach for spring break and there are 3 different people here that I went to high school with and knew kinda well. I told my friends with me I saw on a Facebook post that they were here and they told me to message them to see if we could hang out with them and their sorority. It shouldn't of been a big deal but I was so anxious and nervous about that. Has anyone else had something like this where basically high school still bothers you really bad? \", \" Happened to me today. I was walking with my group from a project towards the school when I had to get my bike, and I bicycled up on the side and started walking with them again. In the instant I realized I was just walking next to this guy and you probably know then that people tend to enter a sort of mode, when we're walking side-by-side that encourages conversation... but I just walked in silence, panicking in my head for the whole walk and managed to say absolutely nothing. The guy next to me took up his phone to look at it after a minute.

I never really went outside to play or had people over for sleepovers. Never really went to parties or got laid (until college) or drank or did drugs. Social media is so toxic. You shouldn’t compare your life to what people are doing, because you’re different and you should go at the pace you’re comfortable with and can go (not everyone has the money to go out everyday for example). It may not seem like it now, but you have a lot ahead of you, trust me. Now I’m 22, turning 23. I got my first job at 21 (unlike my friends who had jobs at 16) and that helped me out of my bubble. With the money, I’ve gone out to bars, went to clubs, parties, traveled, found new restaurants, met new people, found a passion, tried new things. I’m currently looking to go to my very first concert actually. These teens that go to parties and drink and look like they’re having the time of their lives are living a fantasy. They only do it for social media, to fill their insecurities. They use someone else’s money to seem like they’re “living” and you’re not. But life’s more than social media, really living is more than just parties and drinking. It’s finding yourself through your own capabilities and being surrounded by positivity. You like netflix and gaming? Try your best to find people who also like it, make new friends, hang out, and it’ll open a gateway of new things to try. There’s nothing wrong with your interests, don’t compare yourself to others because society deems it “wrong” somehow.', ' Amen to that!!! Phone calls.

He threw it on the ground as I scooped my arms up in the air with nothing in my hands, literally I was probably 5 feet away when I scooped up my arms. So embarrassing, *everyone* started laughing hysterically and I felt like fucking dying.

My other options would either be open up my own business but idk where to even begin with that, as business is not my major, or to do freelance writing since I just completed an internship with that kind of work. Idk tho, I’m still scared to work a real and professional job. I’d rather work a low level fast food service position than work in a professional environment in all honesty.

We had played and it was 2 AM now and every band member was dancing with tons of other people to a concert in the village's center. My friends and I had gone on a walk through the village and the we went to the concert again. I had barely slept the night before and I had drank coffee, and when you are 15 and this is really shit. So, a major dance comes up and every bamd member joins, I was in the bench watching the concert and my friends were too. The invited me but I was really afraud of going. I had 2 choices, go dance with them and feeling anxious being around so many people or I could do the worst and that was what I choose. I sat in the bench and declined going to dance whike everyone was dancing, they found this weird ofc and they approached me and asked what was wring with me, I got even more anxious and more peoole came up to me making me the centre of attentions. I told them I was tired and needed to sleep, the woman brought me to her home where I was staying, while everyone was dancing and partying.

They say that our anxiety causes up to make stupid decisions but I had a similar situation to yours and took the alternate route. I was around 14 at the time. My mum dropped me off at the bank to do a transaction that takes about half an hour to process while she went to the supermarket next door to shop. It took about an hour to get to a teller and finish the transaction then I called my mum to let her know I was finished. She wouldn't answer. It was raining outside so I just decided to sit back down in the waiting area figuring she would call me when she's ready. Over the next hour, the waiting area clears and the tellers keep glancing at me probably wondering why I was loitering. I lean back and doze off. I feel a tap on my leg and open my eyes to see a manager and security guard in front of me. The manager asks if I need help with something and I say no that I'm just waiting on my mum to pick me up. She gives me an odd look and says okay and nods to the security guard. I check my phone and realise I've been sleeping for 30 minutes. Before I can decide what I'm going to do I get a call. It's my dad. He sounds angry and asks where I am. I tell him I'm in the bank waiting for mum to come back for me. He then tells me that someone in the bank called and told him that I was there sleeping in the waiting area well after I had finished my business with the bank. He said I looked like an idiot just sitting there. After he hangs up, I look around and see the tellers and security guards staring at me again; they probably heard my conversation. I pack up and go outside and stand behind a column so no one in the bank could see me waiting. About 20 minutes later my mum pulls up and I get in the car. She asks how long I've been waiting and then why I hadn't just gone to the supermarket when I finished. I don't know. I was so embarrassed by the whole situation. I never went back to that branch but after it closed, some of the staff were moved to the other branch I used in order to avoid ever seeing those people again. It'd be another hour to find the next closest branch so I've been stuck seeing these people since.\", ' But what do you do in the park? Just look at people? ', ' Not really socialize but leaving the house during the night is much easier for me because there is pretty much no one outside here ', 'I think that really may have something to do with it. I still have a tracking app on my phone and I’m a 22 year old college senior who doesn’t live at home. Both my parents were protective but especially my mom. I never learned to swim because she has a fear of water. I couldn’t drive half a mile down the street to get gas without her with me in the car and that was when i was approaching 18 just about to get my license after years of refusing to drive with me. I had never gone to any sort of social event as a child without her there and i was 17 before i ever even got my hair cut without her there (to this day i can’t socialize with barbers). Even on breaks while I’m in college i can’t link up with high school friends to hang out without her trying to guilt trip me for not giving her every single detail of what was planned so yeah there’s probably truth there.

My brain switched to this type of \"who cares? fuck em\" mentality and I felt like I could do anything and talk to anybody, literally. I left my room, went outside and felt the need to finally greet my neighbor first and actually did some small talk! I felt like going outside and doing things and I did. It was a really weird feeling that stayed with me for at least a week. It was so intense that at some point I started becoming scared of my own self like \"This is totally not like me, what is happening to me, why do I feel like this?\", \"What if I suddenly snap out of this\", etc... As the days passed, the feeling started to fade away and I was slowly reverting back to my old self. About a month or two later I decided to try it again but that time it wasn\\'t as powerful as before. I got a little boost for the day and was back to my old self.

Soon I’ll be an adult and i missed my chance to just act like a crazy teen with friends. The problem is I had no friends. When I was a child, like up to middle school, I was shy around adults but never really anxious around my peers. I had a lot of fun growing up, I even had the guts (but it didn’t even feel like a big deal at the time) to knock on my classmates doors and ask them to impromptu hang out and ride bikes and everything.

', ' I’ve always experienced this sensation of being bullied by my friends or random people when in public cause they always gave me this weird look. I think in the moment of socializing with your friends if they tend to laugh randomly you’ve failed to grasp the joke that someone inherently made which may or may not be at you. I feel like I sometimes go into my own bubble whenever I’m outside and only notice things like my friends all of a sudden laughing, etc. In a situation where a inside joke is made and you are left on the outside it’s hard to decide if you missed out or basically am a target. I think it’s up to how much you trust each person as «friends» to let yourself be more comfortable in those situations. For example I used to have these situations a lot. But since I’ve learnt that my friends wouldn’t want to intentionally harm me by saying something bad or physically for that matter. I still struggle to accept «friendly banter» like jokes directed towards you as I sometimes take it too personal and start getting moody cause of it. I am accepting over the fact that they never mean it in a harmful way which helps me to recover more as I’ve never really mentioned my depression or social anxiety to them. So it’s only fair that they treat me normally and poke some fun at me sometimes. In the end I believe it’s up to how much you trust each friend to start and feel more comfortable during these situations. Best of luck as I know it’s not easy and I don’t really know how your friends act towards you or how the jokes feel as I don’t know the situation.
